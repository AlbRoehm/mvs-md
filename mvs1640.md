# Chapter 1640: What have we done?

Derik had acted very swiftly, and it didn't even take him a second to throw the other person into the line of fire. He knew that Hannah wouldn't be on his side or agree to do something like this, so he had acted on his own.

If she had come moments later, then perhaps Hannah would have attacked Derik to stop all of this. However, there was one thing that the red vampires had in common, and that was a hatred for the dhampirs who had killed many of their close friends, family and allies.

Without a doubt, in their eyes, the dhampirs were enemy number one, which was why after seeing the yellow glow in Jessica's eye, Hannah had already made up her mind with whose side she would be on.

Taking out a small short sword, Hannah thrusted it forward, and in doing so, a red line of aura shot out similar to the blood bullet. It wasn't as fast, nor would it be as strong, but there was no drawback to using a blood skill like this through the weapon.

"Wait!" Lucia shouted out who was in the middle of the room; she stood up from the ground and held out her hand open. She couldn't use her lighting powers in her weapon like she usually would have but could still use a small portion of her ability on her hands.

Regardless of this, the attack pierced right through Lucia's hand. Running up her arm, it even shot through her shoulder.

"Arghh!" Lucia cried in pain. "Blocking those attacks without Qi is a lot harder than i thought, and why does it seem like ever since I've joined these guys, I keep getting hurt."

Either way, Lucia had somewhat done her job, as the attack had slowed down slightly, and it was then that Jessica had the time to turn the side of her blade and use her Yellow aura to stop the attack. As the red aura hit, the strength of the two attacks seemed to collide. Hannah's attack turned out to be more powerful than Jessica had thought.

"These guys, both of them are leaders of a red vampire squad... and I'm nobody. This is going to be a tough fight!"

Thinking this, while she was still trying to stop the attack from Hannah, it left room for Derik to deliver another punch. She protected her head, but Derik aimed right for the gut while twisting his fist again.

Jessica could feel her insides being slightly ruptured as the attack was stronger than that of the first lot. It seemed like Derik's earlier words that his punches would get stronger with each attack were true.

However, this time, Jessica was expecting it, and she had a goal to achieve. While flying through mid-air, she attached all the strings she could to Derik's arm and pulled them as extensively as possible, countering the momentum from the hit, which would have sent her flying into the wall.

But before she could do anything else, she saw Hannah come from the side, this time, she was using the sword itself covered in the red aura. As she went for an attack, Jessica pulled herself forward, using the strings on Derik to avoid the strike.

"Now you want a punch in your face, don't you!" Derik shouted while clenching his fist, ready to pound her in the face. With as much strength as he had now, she was sure she would die if anything happened.

So as her body hurled at him, she threw her dagger with as much yellow aura as she could. It pierced through Derik's hand and cut the strings off from him, ducking down to the point where she could roll on the ground and get past him.

Quickly getting up off the ground, she held her stomach, which was in pain, and there was even a little trickle of blood coming from the corner of her mouth.

"Maybe I could take out one of them, but even fighting with my powers, I can't take on these two at once." Jessica thought.

Seeing everything going on, Lucia also felt guilty for already using most of her powers. Maybe if she had recovered, she would have been able to do a little more, and at the same time, she imagined if the other two were here, then they wouldn't be able to do anything.

Lucia had Minny in her hands, the latter's arms were still broken and hadn't recovered, but she was awake, though still under intense pain.

"I'm sorry, Minny. I can't do anything, but maybe you can." Lucia thought as she placed her hand above her mouth. The wound from earlier that was created on her hand was bleeding. She squeezed tightly, pouring the blood into Minny's mouth.

As it slowly dropped into her, Minny started to feel better, and her arms began to recover just that bit more.

"Minny, we will protect you, but right now, one of your sisters needs your help!" Lucia squinted, feeling bad for relying on a child, but this was no ordinary child.

When Minny opened her eyes, she looked towards Jessica, who seemed concerned, and without a second of hesitation, Minny held up both of her hands. She was trying to create the blood rifle attack that so badly had hurt her hands again.

Looking behind her for a second, Hannah noticed what was happening. "MOVE!" Hannah shouted, immediately putting her palm on the floor. She created the thickest blood wall she had ever done before. Then she also decided to do something strange; she proceeded to stab herself several times with her own weapon.

In the next second, Hannah had become somewhat of a blur. Minny fired the two blood rifles off in her direction. It had smashed through the blood wall without a hitch and continued forward, hitting the wall on the other side and creating a large hole.

Minny's arms were completely mangled once again, and she was left exhausted as she tried to catch a breath. She didn't pass out this time but was grimacing in pain with each breath.

"They... how did they avoid that?" Lucia said as she could see that both of the red vampires were fine. With Hannah having pushed Derik out of the way.

"The ability to get faster with each hit." Jessica recognised. "She attacked her own body several times for a speed boost. Damn it, they have strong abilities."

"Finish off the dhampir. The little girl won't be able to do much anymore!" Hannah ordered.

Hannah couldn't act on her own because even though she hadn't been hit by the blood rifle attacking herself, she was still badly injured. Following her orders, Derik went towards Jessica with pleasure. The latter attempted to move, but pointing out her blade, Hannah fired out another blood attack, showing that her end would be even worse if she moved.

Doing this perfectly, firing out a fast blood attack each time as a distraction, allowed Derik's punch to land. She was either to be hurt from the blood attacks from Hannah or to take a punch from Derik.

While doing her best to avoid the blood attacks, Derik's fist was ready to hit her. But suddenly, something happened.

Minny appeared between Jessica and Derik. Her arms were blood-red as if the attack's recoil had destroyed all the vessels in them, they were floppy as her small bones had broken from using such a powerful attack, and yet she still stood there with a severe expression on her face.

"I won't let them take you!" Minny shouted, and from her back rose a shadow which instantly moved towards Derik's fist. It blocked the attack, stopping it, and before anything could happen, Derik's full strength punch became useless.

Seeing all this, Hannah's mouth opened wide as she lost the grip around her sword.

"Is this... little... g... g... girl... guardian? But how... how is that... possible?!"

Even Derik stopped his punch by dropping both arms to the sides, his mouth was wide open, while Minnie was very tired, she didn't have much shadow power, and blocking this punch took away a lot of mc cells from her, slowly, the shadow started to fall from her body, but before that happened, something strange happened.

As the shadow touched the floor, it created a large circle as if a pool of shadows was created and a figure could be seen slowly rising from it. The figure's outline looked somewhat familiar to the others, and as the shadows began to fade, they knew who it was.

"NO.... what have we done?!" Hannah's heart dropped when she recognised the figure as well.

*****

# Chapter 1641: Worst Pain.

Rising from the pool of shadows was the silhouette of Quinn, yet from Derik and Hannah's point of view, that person might have been the grim reaper himself. That was just how afraid the two Red Vampires were when faced with the power of the Celestial Vampire who they had known for such a short period of time.

"He told us he would come if we were really in trouble, and here he is..." Lucia thought, letting out a little sigh of relief. Still, the air in the room remained thick enough to be cut, the tension high, because nobody knew what that person would do next.

Quinn had sensed Minny was using shadow. Shadow in some way, he became aware that the group of girls had to be in trouble. As such, he hadn't hesitated to use his Shadow Link.

The truth was, the vampire had never taught Minny how to use that skill, to have it active one would have to leave a small part of their shadow powers active. Not teaching her was how Quinn could tell that they were in trouble because the link had become active.

Looking at those angry eyes, Hannah understood that her worst fears had come true. She had run over here in the first place to prevent such a scene from happening. She didn't know what Quinn's real goal was, or what Derik had been planning, but one thing was for sure, they didn't want to upset this person.

"What is going on?" Hannah thought. "I was already overwhelmed when I saw the little vampire use the shadow powers. I didn't see him here before, and it looked like he rose from the shadows. Is he another guardian? Since when do guardians travel together?"

"Dammit... could it be that he's teaching the little girl to become guardian in the future? If so, that means we've made a colossal mistake! We'll be lucky if they don't excommunicate us from the Red Vampires for harming them..."

Considering that possibility, Hannah was trying to figure out if there was any way for them to salvage this situation, or at least buy enough time to explain themselves. She could tell with the little time they had spent that Quinn was extremely protective over the girl.

"Minny..." Quinn whispered, yet his voice trailed off, that was because he had already noticed all of what looked like destroyed blood cells in Minny's arms. He hadn't been there when the small girl had used the Blood Rifle before, so he had no clue that this was the aftermath of her own action.

Her arms were mangled, and it looked like the blood was trying to rupture through the skin but was unable to. Seeing this, something had come over Quinn that he hadn't felt in a long time.

A rush of blood was moving all over his body, his heart beating louder than before, and his hands were slightly shaking. If he didn't do something about this rising energy soon, it felt like it would completely consume him.

"Minny, tell me who did this to you." Quinn requested, his teeth grinding against each other, as he was finding it hard to speak through the anger that was rising in him.

"That man... he hurt sister Jessica!" Minny exclaimed, not holding back, she swung her injured arms as they weren't in the best shape, but Quinn knew who she was pointing at. The next second, before Minny's arm even swung down, before anyone could Say anything, Quinn already had his hand right around Derik's throat.

No one in the room had seen Quinn move, the room wasn't large by any means, but the Celestial Vampire didn't limit his speed at all, not in the current state he was in, and where he had left from the floor boards had been destroyed underneath as well.

"No, wait!" Hannah shouted out. "The vampire you were travelling with, she's not really a vampire, she's a Dhampir!"

There were some strange things that Hannah had noticed when travelling together, and the other three seemed more of a tight-knit group than the two girls that would often be with them, so she was hoping revealing the fact, that one of them was their mortal enemy might make him stop his aggression.

Also, she was sure that it would be a secret that the Dhampir wanted to keep at all costs. Even Jessica herself started to worry that things could be turned on their head at any second and that Quinn would instead come for her. Lucia was also contemplating what she could do to help her friend.

"Don't listen to her, Nate! That bastard broke Minny's arms! All she wanted to do was help Jessica because he was trying to kill her!" Lucia shouted, hoping that would sway things.

However, in the first place, Quinn hadn't even turned around for a second to confirm whether Jessica was what they claimed her to be... simply because the Celestial Vampire didn't care about it. He could always verify the truth of the matter later, but now was the time for punishment!

Letting go of Derik's neck, immediately, Quinn held onto the Red Vampire's hands. At that moment, the pale surface of his skin started to light up red, small spots started to arrive until it filled his arms completely. Then blood squirted out as the pressure of the blood from inside his body was too much. piercing through the pores of his skin.

"ARGHH!" Derik screamed in pain as he felt the blood burst through every part of his skin like a balloon.

"Tell me, was it fun breaking the arms of a little, innocent girl? Are you proud of your actions?" Quinn asked, yet he wasn't done with just that. He soon started pulling one finger after the after, breaking them with great speed, before moving on to each bone in Derik's body, using his strength to crack them. Now not only was blood covering his skin, but part of his bone had ripped through it.

Hannah wanted to jump in and stop him, idiot Derik might be, that didn't change the fact that he was her subordinate, yet something about Nate's eyes made her abandon any will to get in his way. She knew powerful vampire wasn't using the "Influence" skill, but she instinctively knew if she tried anything, she would be the next one to suffer his wrath.

Kicking his victim right by the knee, flying through the air, his legs came off. They had been broken off from the joints and hit the wall. Quinn had let go of his arms, making him, who was now considerably, fall to the floor on his bloody stumps.

"Don't think for a second I'm done with you. My instinct was telling me that you were dangerous, yet i gave you the benefit of the doubt... Only for you to prove me completely right by demonstrating that you someone who doesn't deserve to live."

The fridge door swung open, and out from it, all the blood from the cartons of blood juice had been removed. It soon floated over to where Quinn was, breaking off from the pool of blood that was behind Quinn, a fraction of it suddenly went right into Derik's mouth.

It was at that moment that the wounds on Derik started to heal.

"What is happening? Is that everything? Is he now healing me?"

There was visible confusion on the Red Vampire's face, but when his arms had fully healed, his bones and skin back to what they used to be, he felt pressure on his wrists again, and the build up of pressure like a balloon was felt.

"This was just the beginning" Quinn stated coldly. "You will soon beg me to end your life."

It was a cycle, Quinn was going through a cycle of torture with Derik, letting him experience the same thing over and over, healing him from near death. For some reason, each time Quinn thought that the anger in him would disappear, but it hadn't. In the end, the blood from the cartons had run out, and Derik was left there, a shell of his former self.

His mind had long since shattered, unable to mentally endure such a procedure.

"One more thing needs to be done, the worst pain a vampire can ever experience." Quinn started opening the palm of his hand and a shadow started to form.

*****

# Chapter 1642: Runaway.

The others in the room had no clue what Quinn would do next, and soon they saw something strange forming around his palm. It was a dark spherical shadow that began to turn into the shape of a dragon head as it left his palm.

The shadow changed shape, growing so large it looked like it was a real beast. The shadow was long, had no legs or arms, and looked more like it had a serpent's body, as it had no wings. However, due to its head shape and size, without a doubt, it was clearly a dragon.

"What is this..." Jessica and the others all stared at the scene with their mouths wide open. They were witnessing something like this for the first time in their lives. Most of them had seen glimpses of video of the shadow power being used in different ways, but never like this.

Bracing himself, Derik squinted his eyes as the shadow came towards him, he was still at a loss of judgement, and that was when the shadow passed directly through him. As it did, it felt like something had come out of his body, as if a part of him was taken away from him.

In the next moment, a burning sensation overcame him as if Quinn had lighted up his body in flames. Immediately, he tried to use his broken arms, but they were useless. Kneeling on the floor, Derik was now screaming and shrieking in pain.

"Minny... i'm sorry that you had to see this." Quinn said, not looking at her, afraid of the look she would have on her face. "But I want you to know the extent of what your powers can do. This was taught to me by a great man, i am sure you know him too. And this skill was developed by him, and he used it to punish vampires for their wrongdoings. To make sure that they never acted out again."

"Perhaps the vampires have forgotten about this fact, and they need reminding that the Punishers are still exist."

Thinking about it, Quinn was officially the Punishers leader, or, at least at one point, he had claimed the title of that. He also noticed that since evolving, his shadow eater skill seemed to change slightly, and due to that, he had gained more MC cells from the vampire than he assumed he would have received.

Just now, he had obtained about 200 MC points.

"Perhaps it won't take me that long to get my MC cells back up to how much they used to be." Quinn thought.

Derik kept screaming, but the others didn't know how to react. Eventually, Minnie, whom Quinn was trying to protect, started crying on the spot due to Derik's scream. Hearing this, Quinn thought it was a signal to put an end to this outrage. Using his shadow, he threw it over Minnie's eyes, blocking her vision, and then the screams suddenly stopped.

When the shadow descended once again, Derik's body was no longer there because Quinn had placed it in his shadow not to make Minny any more uncomfortable.

"Minny is just a child. I didn't want to show her that... i said I would look after her... These people, it was because of these people that i had to show her something like that." Quinn thought and immediately turned his head towards Hannah. She was next.

The other vampires that had joined the attack were already standing at the edge of the room. Kneeling on the floor and begging for forgiveness, they didn't even dare raise their head.

As for Hannah, her whole body was shaking, and she, too, hadn't moved. She was so afraid that she even felt a warm trickle down her leg.

"This... man, he has complete control over the shadow... is he a secret leader of the red vampires? Was he here to supervise us... or is it something else?"

The next second, Hannah went down on her knees and kneeled as well.

"I apologise for my subordinates' actions!" Hannah shouted. "I initially came here to stop him. I didn't want to cause any harm to you or your group. We didn't know you were a Guardian. Even then i know this was not an excuse for our actions, i only acted because i saw the dhampir..."

"Quiet!" Quinn spoke in a stern tone, "You are mistaken. I am not these damn guardians you speak of. You have mistaken me for them?"

Hearting this, Hannah wondered how that was even possible. Only the guardians and one of the leaders knew of the shadow powers. In the end, she could only ask.

"Then who are you?"

"I said before already; I am a Punisher, someone who uses his shadow powers to punish the vampires who abuse their powers," Quinn replied.

He had somewhat expected a reaction from the others because he still remembered how much fear the word punishers had instilled in the vampires before. However, there was no reaction from them all whatsoever.

"Punishers... forgive me; I do not know of them," Hannah replied as she started to panic. She couldn't think of a way to get out of this situation, so she said whatever came to her mind, "Didn't you join the red vampires for a reason? Did you perhaps want to meet the others with shadow powers... maybe I can help somehow? You tried joining our organisation for a reason, right... I can help you."

This was a familiar scene to Quinn. When one's life was on the line, they would do almost anything to protect it. The organisations they had joined, the loyalty they exhibited will disappear.

"Originally, i did," Quinn said. "But there is one thing that i will never do, and that is to allow those close to me, those i wish to protect, to get hurt, just because of my own goals. There are other ways i can find out what i want without bringing any unnecessary trouble."

As he finished, he moved his hand and spread his palm in the direction of Hannar. It looked like Quinn was ready to use the shadow eater skill again.

"NOOOO!" Minny shouted. "No more, please... please... i don't want you to hurt anyone anymore... anymore... please stop!"

Quinn's hand lowered to her side, and silence filled the room. One could only hear Minny sniffling while others remained silent.

Jessica and Lucia knew of the guardians, many people did due to the reports, but it was quite clear that this vampire in front of them wasn't a Guardian and it seemed like he was even quite disgusted by the fact that someone might consider him so.

"I'm just happy that he's on our side instead of being on the enemy's side." Lucia thought. "I was right; this vampire is something special. He clearly knows something, and there is a reason why our leader was so kind to him."

Just then, as if on cue to end this small scuffle, a Vampire Corps unit stormed through the door. They stepped into the room with their red aura brandished out, expecting a fight. It seemed like with everything going on, in particular the screams. The vampires nearby had finally gained some sense to report to the higher-ups.

However, what came as a surprise was the number of high level vampires that had entered the room. In this new group were some of the lieutenants who were on stage earlier, and eventually, Yaddy had stepped inside as well.

"I had a feeling that this vampire would cause trouble, but to cause so much on the first day..." Yaddy thought as he saw the mess in the room while unconsciously blaming it on Quinn.

After swiftly considering what to say, Lucia was the first to act.

"Thank you for arriving. These people are part of the Red Vampires." She almost shouted while pointing at Hannah and her group. "We found out, and they tried to silence us."

Looking at the situation, of course, Yaddy didn't know what to believe, but for a second, Hannah glanced at Quinn, and she knew what to do.

"What she has said is right... we are working with the red vampires." Hannah accepted, thinking that it might be her only way to get out of the situation safely, and perhaps it was for the best.

Soon, the Vampire Corps rounded up the Red vampires and took them away while also asking for Quinn and his group to make a report. However, when Yaddy got to Jessica, he paused for a second as she looked down, trying to hide her face.

Yaddy frowned, and after a moment of pause, he suddenly shouted, attracting everyone's attention.

"Jessica... it's you! What are you doing here?! We have been looking for you everywhere!"

*****

# Chapter 1643: The only one

Walking slowly, Peter could see the city on site, it was the area where most of the Vampire Corps members and some humans would live. The reason the Wight was currently out there was due to the fact that he had been suddenly left stranded out in the middle of nowhere on his own.

Peter had been patiently waiting for Quinn, something he had no problem doing after spending more than a thousand years doing it already, however he was particularly annoyed at his best friend right now. After being dragged out to this place, the vampire had left his shadow and Peter was getting ready to transform, to show off the new-found powers Quinn appeared to be interested in, yet the first thing he had been told was: "The others are in trouble, Minny has used her shadow powers..."

It was the only explanation he got, before the Celestial Vampire used his Shadow link to disappear. Now, usually Peter would have run to the others if they were in trouble, but given the strength level of those they had met ever since they had woken up, the Wight was sure that there was no need for him to assist.

"Honestly, I hope there's someone there to give that guy a good slap in the face for treating me this way..."

As he entered the city, Peter quickly realised that there were quite a lot of vampires that were paying attention to him. Most of them seemed to be wearing Vampire Corp gear, while a few of them were just their family members.

"It really is him, he was the one that got the special award, you can tell from his little badge on his shoulder."

The odd comments on his way back made sense to him, but the attention he was getting didn't. In the end, he could only assume that the little emblem badge that he had received was a bigger deal than he took it for.

After finally reaching the room, though, Peter was greeted with an empty, partially destroyed room. Not a single person was inside.

"What is going on?" Peter asked out loud, hoping someone was still there that could answer his questions, but there was no reply.

"Man, is everyone just forgetting about me or something?"

A few moments before Peter had arrived, General Yaddy looked to be over the moon that he had discovered Jessica. The initial frown that was there when he first entered the room had turned upside down. However, Quinn quickly noticed that Jessica herself wasn't too pleased about being recognised. In fact, she looked frightened and was hugging one of her arms.

"Jessica, I can't believe we finally found you after all this time. Andy has been looking for you everywhere. He'll be over the moon to hear that you're safe and sound." Yaddy stated, but after saying these words, even he could tell something was up.

"Actually, I was hoping that you could keep this a secret from Commander Andy?" Jessica replied with a half smile. It looked like she was trying her best but couldn't.

Listening in on the conversation wasn't just Quinn, but Lucia as well. However, the human woman was busy taking care of Minny. She was giving her more of her own blood, so the little girl's arms would heal slightly faster.

While she was doing this, Minny was hugging her tightly, having turned around to not look at the one she had called Dad. Lucia felt that the girl was slightly trembling. Not that Lucia could blame her in any way. After what they had all seen, everyone had mixed feelings towards Quinn.

"Wait, do they not know she's a Dhampir?" Lucia wondered. "Or is that why they want her? Could Jessica actually be an important person to them or something. I guess she had a reason for running away all the way to the Graylash families..."

"I'm afraid I can't do that." Yaddy eventually shook his head. "We were instructed to immediately report if we found you. Honestly, I never knew you ran away... I have to report this matter and see what they say. I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to come with me to the base. We can't lose sight of you again."

Hearing this, Jessica, tried to move out of the way as the Vampire Corps members came up to her. It looked as if they were about to treat her like a fugitive. When trying to move she didn't have much luck, after all she had already used a lot of strength in the fight.

"No... what do you plan on doing with sister Jessica?! Why does everyone want to hurt her?" Minny protested tears in her eyes.

Before the guards could even get close to her, Quinn took a step forward to stand in their way. Knowing what he had done earlier in the day with just his Influence skill, the two immediately stopped what they were doing.

"May I remind you that right now she is travelling with me? To me, it looks like she doesn't want to go along with you guys." Quinn stated calmly, yet everyone clearly understood this to be a warning.

The happy face once again turned sour, and it was due to the same person yet again.

"How many times in a day does this vampire intend to upset me? I'm just following official orders... I can't go against this guy no matter what, but I can't let Jessica get away either." The General was at a loss at what to do.

"Fair enough." Yaddy let out a sigh. "In that case, might I invite all of you to the Vampire Corps base. I'll just make the report, and when they arrive if you wish to talk to them then please do. If that is alright with you."

It was still somewhat hurtful for Yaddy, having trained and fought for so long to get to the position he was in, and in one day he had to treat someone he didn't know as if he was superior to him.

Quinn looked towards Jessica to see if she was okay with this proposal, to which she nodded a few times. Honestly, she was already happy that Quinn had done this much for her, even after knowing what she really was.

The agreement has been reached, so Quinn and his group followed Yaddy to the base. He informed them that he would give them housing there to prevent more incidents like the earlier one, though everyone seemed to understand that it was mostly to keep Jesscia close to them.

"That reminds me, the other two Dhampirs are still in my shadow space as well." Quinn remembered as he saw Hannah being taken away.

******

A short while later, and the whole group was at the Vampire Corps base, where they had been given a more standard small bunk bed like room, compared to the apartment room they had before to rest for the night.

At first everyone sat there in silence for a bit. Everyone had questions for the others, about what Quinn had done, his Shadow powers, the Punishers in general. Then there were all the questions that surrounded Jessica as well.

However, since no one spoke up, they understood that unless they were ready to share their own secrets, they shouldn't ask the others. In due time, they were sure that they would tell each other their secrets. It was then that Quinn realised something.

"Oh crap, Peter! I completely forgot to leave him a note or anything about where we're going. How could I have forgotten about him." Quinn stood up, ready to leave the room to bring back Peter, before that, though, he turned to Minny.

"Minny, will you come along with me? We need to get your Uncle Peter here. Your sisters did a good job protecting you, but they need to rest now, and I can look after you better this way." Quinn said in a soft voice.

For a second, Minny looked a bit hesitant, but in the end, she ran over to Quinn as she usually would have, opening her arms for him to pick her up. As always he placed her on his neck. Seeing that she didn't resent him, a big weight fell off Quinn's heart.

He didn't even realise why he felt so tense at a child disliking him. Either way, the truth was Quinn wanted to explain his actions to the small girl, while looking for Peter. Fortunately, given his shadow powers, he could sneak out of the place without having to deal with anyone else.

After the two left the room, it didn't take long for Lucia to fall asleep. The human woman had been exhausted, and Jessica followed suit... at least she made it appear like she was doing the same. Once she heard some light snoring sound from the other bed, she got off the bed and headed for the door.

"Where do you think you're going?" Lucia asked. who had only pretended.

"I'm sorry." Jessica stated. "I didn't think it would come to this, at least not this soon, I don't want to drag any of you into my personal trouble."

Lucia couldn't help but laugh at this comment, "In trouble because of you? Have you completely forgotten how much trouble we already encountered while travelling with the three of them? ...besides, you saw him right? What trouble do you think could arise that he couldn't handle?"

Jessica paused for a second, as it she was really pondering her option. Ultimately, she clenched her fist and teeth, having come to a decision.

"No, I know he's strong, but there is no way he can get me out of this. I have to leave now before it's too late." Tears started to flow down Jessica's face, showing that she was truly upset at this fact. "I'm sorry, I've enjoyed spending this time with all of you, but I'm afraid the only one who could help me now would be the Hero himself, Quinn Talen."

With that, she stormed out of the room.

*****

# Chapter 1644: A real daughter

General Yaddy did exactly what he said he would: making a report to the main base of the vampire corps unit on Earth. He thought he would need to do this as quickly as possible to get a response about what to do next.

However, what he did refrain from in his report was about the troublesome vampire whom Jessica was currently travelling with. He had debated with himself what to say, but no matter how he phrased it, Yaddy felt it would make him look reckless, and it might show him as an erratic leader who couldn't handle the situation.

Many members in the Corps were after his position, mainly the vampire Corps Generals on other planets; this was because, in a way, being the leader of the vampire Corps unition Mars made him the Number Two in the vampire Corps, and if he were to report about Quinn, his rivals would make sure to take advantage of the situation.

"Let's see what they say; I don't believe he will try to go up against the whole vampire corps unit. No matter how strong he is, going against the whole Corps isn't something he is capable of."

Standing in the command centre in the vampire Corps unit, Yaddy soon received a response from the main base on Earth. And the answer he got only made his heart beat faster, which was not a normal reaction from a vampire.

'No... no... he's coming here... he's coming here to see her personally. That means he will meet that vampire too... What will happen now?"

It was safe to say that Yaddy had gone into full panic mode because he realised he had made a mistake when re-reading the message.

"Wait... he's not coming here...he is already here!"

Presently, Quinn was peacefully walking back the way he had gone before, hoping to run into Peter somewhere. He had already checked the room they were in previously and no one was there, so he could only imagine that Peter perhaps had remained at the same spot as before.

"I mean, he stood in the same place for a thousand years, so it's not far-fetched to say that he's right now in the same spot where I left him."

Quinn felt slightly strange walking through the city. The night sky was out, and beast crystals were being used as a light source in different ways, such as street lamps, being carried on personnel, or hanging the lamps outside the barracks, to light the whole area.

Normally, almost everyone would go to sleep once the night darkens, but vampires need less sleep than humans; they could go a few days without feeling tired at all before going to sleep.

It was usual for Quinn to see that in the vampire settlement, but this place wasn't the vampire settlement.

"Da... dad..." Minny finally spoke. This was the first word she had said since coming out of that place. She had realised that Quinn was hiding his appearance and didn't want to be called by his name, and rather than mess up and call him Nate, she chose to call him dad.

"Why... Why did you do that to that man?... Why did you hurt him so much? He was screaming so much he must have been in pain, right?" Minny asked hesitatingly.

Hearing this question, Quinn thought it was perhaps time for him to talk to Minny. He looked around and soon found a quiet alley between two buildings. Ordinary people probably wouldn't think this was the best or safest place to talk to a child, but then again, Quinn wasn't an average person.

Putting her down on the ground, Quinn looked Minny in the eye. He then held her hands and calmed her down with a smile.

"Minny, you were scared, weren't you? I want you to know that I will never hurt you. You have to understand that."

"You were precious to Arthur so, much so that he had done things he thought he would never have even considered."

"You know, I believe that if Arthur were looking after you and was in the same spot as I was in earlier, he would have done the same thing. Do you remember what the war was like?" Quinn asked.

Minny nodded her head. She wasn't very involved in the war but had remembered when the Dalki originally came to attack everyone and had taken her away.

"Do you remember how it felt back then when they were hurting everybody? When they took you away, do you remember how your mother felt?"

"Today, I felt the same way your mother felt when those Dalki took you from her. I never want anyone to hurt you. And not just you; I don't want anyone in our family to get hurt."

"I needed to make sure that not just him but none of those in that room tried to do something like that again."

"I didn't enjoy doing that, Minny; in fact, that's the reason I did it. If I make an example of one, then I won't have to do it again."

Quinn's explanation was a bit all over the place. Of course, his anger had consumed him at the time, and perhaps just the shadow eater skill would have been enough to deal with the said person, but it was a feeling he couldn't explain himself.

He just felt a bit more protective over Minny compared to the others.

"Okay... I think I understand. Mummy used to go really worried whenever I nearly got hurt, so I understand your reaction. I know Daddy cares about me like I care about everyone else. But Daddy, what about Mummy? When are we going to go look for her?" Minny asked.

It was the question Quinn had been dreading, but he thought now was a better time than any to tell her. He placed both hands on her shoulders and prepared to tell her the truth.

"Minny, you have to understand. I care about you a lot, and I promise to give you whatever life you want, but you see, when you were in that shadow with Sunny... a thousand years passed in the outside world. You know, your mother, she was a human... so it's unlikely that she... she... is still alive, but I promise I will look for her and find out what happened to her." Quinn quickly stated after.

He had somewhat expected Minny to start balling her eyes out, but instead, she just tilted her head and smiled, but it wasn't a smile of happiness. What Quinn saw was a smile with pain and sadness hidden underneath.

"Thank you for looking after me... Quinn." Minny had noticed that there was no one nearby.

Quinn coughed and turned away for a second. A visible tinge of embarrassment appeared on his face under the moonlight shade.

"You... you can keep calling me dad if you like... I mean only if you want to."

"Sure, thank you, dad." Minny said as she stepped forward and gave Quinn a big hug.

"Don't worry, Minny, if we don't find your mother, I'll make sure to take care of you!" Quinn inwardly promised.

The two of them soon resumed their search through the city for Peter, or Uncle Peter as Minny called him. The first location was of course the spot where Quinn had left Peter earlier, but to his surprise, when the two of them reached that spot, there was no one there.

Quinn frowned and observed the area. There were no signs of any scuffle or anything, this relieved him. He was worried that Peter might attract unnecessary attention, and from how he usually was, it wasn't wrong to say that he might get into a fight with just anyone.

"Where could he have gone?"

Since there were no signs of anything out of ordinary, it was clear that Peter had left the spot on his own.

"Looks like I will have to look through the whole city." Quinn sighed and resumed his search.

Minny noticed the change in mood, and couldn't help but ask, "Dad, what happened? Is Uncle Peter alright?"

Quinn reassured her, "Yes, he will be fine. There are only a very small number of people who can hurt him."

Saying this, he increased his pace and began to look through the city.

And just when Quinn was about to think otherwise, he suddenly heard some cheering coming from one of the dining establishments.

"That sounds like people are having fun. Maybe Uncle Peter went in there?" Minny had noticed the noise too, thanks to her sharp hearing.

"Well, I guess there is no harm in looking at what's going on. Although when I think of Peter, the word fun doesn't exactly come to mind." Quinn thought.

Either way, Quinn walked through into the large establishment. It was a bar, one of the biggest in the city. There were quite a lot of bars because, for some reason, the taste of alcohol felt somewhat the same regardless if one was a human or a vampire.

There were many tables in the bar, where one could sit in a square ordering their drinks and playing games. However, Quinn noticed that everyone was focused on one thing: a boxing ring.

And in the boxing ring was Peter.

"What on earth is he doing here?" Quinn smiled.

Just then, loud words spread throughout the bar.

"Everyone! Give it up for our winner, ZombieP. Is there anyone that would like to go next against our contestant?"

*****

# Chapter 1645 : A competition of strength

It was clear that all eyes were on Peter who was in the ring, and on top of that he had used his old stage name. Although Quinn thought that there would likely be no one who would even remember that name.

In fact, what was even the state of the game power fighters in the first place, Quinn hadn't even had time to enjoy the new wonders of technology since he was busy enjoying everything else.

"Peter, what have you gone and done, the idea was to stay low!" Quinn thought. Right now, it wasn't even best for him to go on stage while everyone was looking. Although, Quinn did have the idea to use the blue fang armour set.

Perhaps he could grab Peter and get out of the place before anyone would notice. However, in the end, Quinn decided to stay and watch for a while, as he wondered just what exactly was going on in the first place.

The next participant had been selected from the crowd, and he appeared to be quite the bulky vampire... at least partly. The vampire had the appearance of someone who was in the gym every day of the week, yet for some reason had decided to skip his legs, making him look like an upside down triangle.

As he entered the ring he was punching his two hands together and Quinn was beginning to think he had an idea just why they had a ring in the centre of the stage, that was until the two of them sat down at a table that had been placed in the centre, that also had tow-bars on the side.

"This is arghhh interesting..." Quinn thought, moving in closer and eventually taking a seat at the bar and ordering a drink.

"Juice please!" Minny shouted straight away as she quickly climbed on top of the stool. Although Minny looked like a kid, the vampire bartender could tell that she was a vampire and thus happily complied, pulling out a little carton of juice.

Usually Quinn would have said something, but with the day that Minny had had, she truly deserved a treat in his opinion, and he had to remember that times were different compared to what he was used to. There seemed to be an abundance of blood these days, and nobody paid any heed to someone drinking blood out in the open.

Looking up at the arena, Quinn soon saw that both Peter and his opponent locked arms, and now he knew exactly what they were doing, but he couldn't quite believe it. Both of their hands were locked in with each other. The next second and a loud bang was heard, and all that could be seen was strain on the large man's face.

His hand hit the table without any resistance. To Quinn's surprise, the table remained fine, yet the same couldn't be said for the challenger's hand. There had been a loud sound indicating that those bones were completely broken.

"You could have gone easy on me, or at least made it look like it was going to be a close match." The large man complained as he calmly looked over the state of his arm. Without having to say anything, seemingly used to this scene, the referee had allowed brought him a drink so that the man could start the healing process.

"I'm sorry, I don't really know how to hold back." Peter merely shrugged.

After watching this short match that had lasted less than a second, Quinn understood what Peter was doing. The Wight was having arm wrestling matches with his fellow vampires from the Vampire Corps unit.

As he walked down, Peter couldn't help but attract the attention of everyone else. In the end, one of the braver Vampire Corps members who had been out on the raid called out to him. The vampire praised the Wight's strength, and seemed quite intrigued in finding out just how strong someone was who managed to get a Bronze blood emblem on their very first day.

Of course, Peter understood that he couldn't just punch his fellow members, yet soon other members gathered around the duo, asking to have a match of their own. The Wight was sure that he could take all of them in a direct fight, but that might be bad for whatever else Quinn might have planned.

Eventually, someone came up with the idea which led to the current situation.

"Well, at least he seems to be having fun, and it looks like he didn't really get in any trouble." Quinn thought.

Seeing how the table was still in good condition even with Peter using his strength, Quinn thought that the table had to at least be made out of Glathrium, or perhaps some stronger material that might have been discovered during his slumber. Of course, that was assuming Peter hadn't lied about the not holding back part.

"Is there anyone else that wishes to go up against our undefeated contender?!" The referee shouted, looking out to the crowd. Seeing the nervous look on all of those out in the bar, Quinn would guess that Peter must have defeated quite numerous vampires already.

"Why don't you go up?" Minny tugged on Quinn's arm.

The bartender, seeing this, couldn't help but chuckle.

"Hey, don't laugh, my Dad is the strongest!" Minny insisted, flexing her small little biceps.

Although Quinn wasn't aiming to correct the man, nor did he have any desire to show off anymore than he already had done, the Celestial Vampire did wonder who among the two friends would be stronger. In the past, he had created the Wight, meaning they had shared a connection that had made it so that Peter would share Quinn's power.

However, at some point, Quinn had surpassed Peter to the point where this would no longer apply. The link between the two of them had broken. Since then, Peter had been able to still get stronger regardless, Quinn had seen that.

Developing his own special use of Qi, and now even using Celestial Energy. The few times Quinn had used Celestial Energy, he hadn't felt his strength change by a large margin. However, from the sounds of it, it would deeply affect Peter's performance.

"That would make somewhat some sense, Bliss didn't seem that strong either, so maybe just because someone is a Celestial or a God, it doesn't mean they are strong."

The bartender served another drink to another customer, and when he turned around to look at Quinn, he almost dropped the glass he was wiping, because he saw the poor father raise his hand.

"What are you doing? You don't have to impress me, you have a daughter, you should look after her!" The bartender shouted.

"It's okay, I'm not trying to impress anyone, I just want to see how much he has improved myself." Quinn answered, who also thought this would be the perfect time to find out first hand how much Celestial Energy could improve one of his, dedicated followers since he had recently gained quite the nice boost.

"Oh what's this, just when it looked like there was no one else, now there are two brave volunteers!" The announcer shouted.

"Two?" Quinn wondered, already having gotten up and out of his seat, he looked around.

"Please both of you make your way up to the stage, and we will decide which order for you guys to take on our champion!"

When Quinn walked up to the stage, he brought Minny along with him, he didn't want her to get out of his sight. At the same time, there were those that noticed Quinn as well. His face had become quite memorable after the meeting, for more reasons than one.

"Hey, isn't that... that vampire, the one that used the Influence skill on the General?"

There were whispers about him everywhere and there were even a couple of people that were so frightened that they left the room, but most stayed, excited to see just what was going to happen. Peter, when seeing that it was Quinn, he just had a large smile on his face.

"Now, don't go easy on me." Peter stated.

"Don't worry, I won't and remember there's another one. Why don't you beat him before you get to me?' Quinn replied.

On the other side of the ring, the other participant who was a well-built man, quite tall and strong, stood there. He was the only other one that had put his hand up, but strangely he had a full lack mask covering his whole face, and only two small slits for his eyes.

"After seeing Peter beat the last person like that, he has to be fairly confident... and there's one more thing. He doesn't smell like a vampire, he smells like a subclass." Quinn thought.

*****

# Chapter 1646: Extreme strength

After receiving the important announcement, General Yaddy was already out and about, walking out of the base. He was travelling with his two close confidants who wore the two silver emblems on their bodies.

As they walked through town, many of the vampire corps units' members greeted them, saluted them or spoke a few words in praise. However, it was clear that General Yaddy had a lot on his mind, as he barely gave any response and did little to acknowledge greetings.

His pace was fast as they walked through the city, while the two men with him kept a close eye on the surroundings. Eventually, they had reached the local landing station. It was an airport made for the that would arrive and depart.

It was large, and every vehicle that arrived would be inspected and the people too before entering the city. In simple words, the security was top notch. That was unless the person was a VIP. In that case, they could get approval to land beforehand with their loading spot, and this was where Yaddy was heading to right now.

"What do you mean he's not here?!" Yaddy shouted at the top of his voice at a staff member.

The staff was instantly terror-strick, as Yaddy's fear was being instilled into him a bit as well.

"Sir, when he landed, he said he wished to explore the place. He also arrived on his own, so only his ship is here. The staff replied.

Yaddy proceeded to slap his forehead upon hearing the news.

"He's exploring the plack; does that mean he's doing an evaluation? Well, if he's just in the city, things shouldn't be too bad, but I thought he would have gone straight to the base."

"Sir, you're not going to like this, but I just received news from the base." One of the men beside Yaddy suddenly spoke, "They just went to the room where Jessica was staying, but it turns out, she and the male vampire are no longer there."

If Yaddy was human, he felt like he could feel a heart attack about to ensue at any moment with how his blood pressure was rising. Everything was going in the worst direction for him and his future.

"Tell them to find her or the vampire. Also, we need to find out where the commander is right now!" Yaddy ordered and took a deep breath to calm himself down. He knew this was not the time to break down.

******

Inside the ring, the mysterious man sat down in his seat confidently. It was hard to gauge his feelings and thoughts. Quinn couldn't even sense an aura in him, no Qi or vampire aura. He had met a few who could control their aura well in the past, most of them being from Pure, but it was unlikely for a Pure's agent to be in a place like this.

Honestly, Quinn still wasn't expecting much from the man. Anyway, there wouldn't be many in the current world who could face Peter when it came to strength. After Peter dealt with this guy, Quinn was actually looking forward to facing Peter himself.

"If you use the same amount of strength as you did against the last guy... you will lose, Wight." The mysterious man wearing the black mask said.

"Oh, says the one that chooses to hide behind the mask. If you were that strong, you wouldn't be any need for you to hide behind the mask." Peter replied while taking a fighting stance as the match was about to begin.

The two latched on their hands, intertwining their fingers to ensure they were holding properly. They then placed their other hand on the metal bar, allowing them to use more of their arm's strength. Then when everything was set, the referee could make the call.

"Start!" The Ref shouted.

Everyone in the bar cheered at the top of their lungs, hoping to see another massacre like they had seen in the last match. However, there was no sudden bang. As seconds flew by, the cheering died, and people whispered about what was going on.

"I said start!" The Ref shouted once more just in case they didn't hear because both of their hands were still dead in the centre.

"I told you, didn't I? You will have to use a lot more strength than that if you want to beat me." The man spoke again.

[Inspect]

[Colossal Draugr]

Using his inspect skill on the person who could match Peter in strength astonished Quinn, but it made some sense now, seeing what subclass this mysterious person was.

"The Draugr class was what Linda was, but, if I remember correctly, she only ever evolved up to a Great Draugr?"

"She had great strength, but it didn't scale up to a creature like Wight. Also, after evolving, Linda was one of the strongest in terms of strength."

"I want to know if he is at an evolution above Linda's, or is he far beyond Great Draugr level?... Also, the scary thing is, I'm guessing he isn't using everything he's got either."

The frustration could clearly be seen on Peter's face. Although Quinn could tell that Peter wasn't using his Qi, different energy was rising in him.

"Sigh, I should stop him, but I guess the others have already seen it." Quinn inwardly sighed.

Peter's whole body started to transform as he used the celestial energy. The vampire corps members got excited at this sight. They had all heard of this but never expected they would see this. At the same time, Quinn was also quite eager to see what these changes were since he had missed out on them.

When Peter started to change though, there was something that would seriously change, and that was his face. His real face was revealed. Quinn looked around to see if anyone noticed, but no one seemed to.

Finally, Peter had finished his transformation, looking the same as before, with a strange tail sticking out from the top of his head, but the red celestial energy was pulsing through his whole body. With this boost in power, Peter smiled before giving it his all, and in the next second, the Qi that will usually cover his hands appeared as well.

Taken by surprise, it looked like the mysterious stranger didn't even have time to act before Peter slammed the latter's hand into the table. This time, the force was so much that the table was also slightly dented.

"It looks like ZombieP is still our winner." The Ref exclaimed in the silent room, breaking the sudden silence.

The whole crowd cheered at this, and as the Ref walked over to lift Peter's hand, he was a little hesitant to grab it since it was still slightly pulsating with the red power. At that moment, Peter raised his hand on his own anyway.

The mysterious man stared at his own hand for a few seconds, it didn't seem too hurt, and after shaking it a couple of times, he healed most of his hand's internal injuries.

"I wonder, could the Draugar have done more in this match? He has piqued my interest." Quinn thought.

The mysterious man stood up and started to walk over in Quinn's direction, which startled the latter a little bit, but as he went past, he lifted his hand as if going for a high five.

"Come on, don't tell me you don't know what this is? It's a tag. I'm tagging out, which means it's your turn. I just hope you put on a better show than me and beat him."

Quinn smiled at the person. At least this one didn't seem to be a sore loser and was a change compared to the annoying flies he would meet.

"Hmm... I'm not sure, but I'll make sure to go all-out from the beginning rather than testing my opponent. I know how strong he is already." Quinn replied as he walked past and headed towards the centre.

Quinn soon sat down at the table. Glancing at the table, he held the table's opposite sides, and then he kneed the table from below, and as he did this, the dent formed due to the previous match came out of the table.

This simple action awestruck the crowd, and they now knew the show wasn't yet over.

*****

# Chapter 1647: Trick the Trickster

Seeing who was on stage and the two that were about to face off, the crowd couldn't help but talk about them. They mainly focused on what had happened earlier today. First, they spoke of Peter's feats on the field; even now, his body was still transformed into the great monstrosity, looking the same as it did then.

However, seeing how he was calm and not attacking others, the vampires felt more calm seeing him this way. There were rumours about when he transformed. He was more like a wild animal that would attack anything on-site, but it was clear that wasn't the case, and he clearly was in control.

Then there was the talk of Quinn. Although not everyone in the bar was a part of the vampire crops unit, most of them worked for the vampire corps, helping one way or another, and they too had heard of what he had done.

A vampire with an influence skill that was even stronger than the general. Of course, the mysterious stranger was able to hear all of this.

"Hmm, these two certainly are interesting, and it looks like they have made quite the stir already. I wonder why the general didn't report anything then?" The mysterious man thought.

Sat opposite each other, the two friends didn't say anything. They both knew they wanted to test their strength, and saying anything would reveal too much. Getting both their hands ready, they quickly held on.

"Since he's using some strange powers, anything goes right?" Quinn asked the ref. Honestly, there really were no rules since this wasn't a common game played by them, and he decided just to say what the people would want.

"Of course."

After answering Quinn's question, he looked at each contestant, who gave the nod calming that they were ready.

"You know, that hair of yours looks pretty strong. but you won't be able to use it in a match of strength," Quinn commented.

"Oh, trust me, I won't need it, but if you think you need your blood aura or Qi to win this, go ahead."

"Oh, trust me, I won't need it, but if you think you need your blood aura or Qi to win this, go ahead." Peter replied.

Minny stood close to the table, looking at them both; she was mainly being ignored. Usually, they wouldn't allow one to get so close and be in the ring, but everyone seemed to ignore that because she was with Quinn.

She looked at both as she didn't know who to cheer for.

"Both of you, fighting!" Minny shouted, pumping her fist.

In the end, she decided that she couldn't support one or the other, even though secretly she did have a favourite, but she would never say that out loud.

"Start!" the ref shouted.

This time unlike before, there was a clear swing in movement. As for the one whose hand had moved, it was Quinn's. It was lightning quick, but there was no bang heard as the back of Quinn's fist was seen centimetres from touching the table.

"His strength really has improved now with the celestial energy. I haven't given him any more points. I wonder why it affects dedicated followers so much and not myself."

With his 200 points of strength, Quinn believed that he might be able to still win this; in the end though, he had to reinforce his arm with the first stage of Qi, giving him extra power. Peter was doing the same, going full blast from the get-go.

Quinn didn't know if it was a tactic of Peter's just to win the match using the Qi and his celestial power or not. Either way, Quim felt like he had this one in the bag.

"I thought I would give you a chance." Peter said, "But if you're not going to go all out."

At that moment, Quinn felt his hand move ever so slightly as the power started to increase, and it looked to be growing bit by bit. This wasn't the celestial energy. Peter had already used all of that; no, this was the Qi surrounding his arm.

"It looks like the Qi training that he has been doing has been paying off... right now... I couldn't be happier, but you aren't the only one that has been trying to learn something new."

Of course, there was an easy way for Quinn to win this, taking away the celestial energy Quinn had given. According to the system, he could take it away and give it back as needed, but that just wouldn't feel right.

Quinn wanted to beat the Peter that was in front of him. Perhaps right now, in a battle of Pure strength, Peter would win, but just like with any fight, there wasn't just strength. There were a number of factors, and Quinn had faced multiple opponents that were far stronger than him and had overcome them. This time he was going to do the same.

In the middle of the match, Quinn closed his eyes. Peter felt like this was a little strange but continued to push forward with his energy. He too, closed his eyes as he tried to draw more Qi from his body to his arm, but that's when Peter noticed something.

Since learning Qi, he could feel his own clearer, and at the moment, it was flowing straight from Peter's hand and into Quinn's.

Is this... did you learn how to use the Qi drain skill? You're stealing his Qi. Ray commented. He quickly realised that this was one of his tricks being used.

"I've always been quite skilled in Qi. I had quite a few good teachers in the past." Quinn said, thinking of Leo and Chris and wondering if the two of them were still alive. "Because I was worried about my vampire aura entering their bodies, I learnt to control it, and I learnt to control others Qi to teach it to them. I realised that perhaps I already had everything needed for the Qi drain skill, and what better time to test it than now."

Quinn wasn't worried. If he took Peter's Qi, he would always give it back, if not by the same method; he also still had the gauntlet. His blood gauntlet may have disappeared, but the other demon tier gauntlet was still in his possession.

Slowly, the tides were turning as Peter's strength was weakening, and Quinn was making a comeback. The arm slowly rose until both of them were in the centre once again. The two strong powers of Qi were colliding against each other. Although Quinn could use the Qi drain, it wasn't as straightforward as he imagined.

The clashes of the two powers caused quite a wave of energy to be sent from the centre of the ring. The vampires sitting closest could even feel it giving them shivers and shaking their glasses on the table.

It was then that Peter knew that he would soon lose this match.

No longer planning on winning this match with his Qi energy, he started to rely on his celestial energy instead.

"Now don't you think this is. A Little unfair." Peter said, his eyebrows shaking as he used every ounce of his strength.

"Aren't you also using something that I gave you in the first place?" Quinn replied, talking about the celestial energy. "Anyway, why don't I give you a hand."

[2 Points of celestial energy have been transferred]

Immediately, Peter could feel the effect of the power and the red pulse in him grew.

He wondered why Quinn would do such a thing in the middle of the match, and sure enough once again, Peter was able to overcome the power even with the added Qi that Quinn had drained.

The truth was, Quinn was trying to see just how much stronger the celestial energy made Peter. At the moment, Quinn wasn't using any celestial energy himself.

"I just wanted to give you a bit of confidence before you lost this match," Quinn said. All of Quinn's hand was starting to become encased in red blood. It was so pure and dense that it just looked like Quinn's arm was red.

"That's some strong blood aura." The mysterious stranger noticed. 'However, I fail to see how this would help him.

The way Quinn had used the blood aura in this instance, he coated it over his arm like some armour which was why the mysterious man was confused, but that was because he had no idea who Quinn was nor what he could do.

Now that his arm was completely coated in the blood aura, Quinn could use his blood control to increase the strength of his arm further and push it that much further. There was a smile on Quinn's face, and the next second, Peter's hand moved so quickly, followed by a loud clang.

The contestants could see a completely destroyed table and Peter on the floor lying there.

"It looks like we have a winner!"

The crowd started to cheer like madmen, as they had just finished watching the most intense arm wrestling match they had ever seen in their life.

"Man." Peter said, getting up off the floor. "I should have tried to stab him a couple of times with my head."

Now the match was over; Peter was reverting back to his form. It looked like he would never be able to surpass his creator, but Peter didn't mind that, he didn't mind that at all.

The mysterious man, this bartender, and more started to clap away at Quinn as he stood there in the centre, and all of them looked at them proudly until a certain person had entered the venue.

"NATE!" Yaddy shouted, with the other two by his side.

Everyone turned and quickly stood up straight as they saw their general enter the venue. "Where is Jessica?" He asked.

Quinn raised an eyebrow at this question because he had no clue what was going on.

"Jessica's missing?" Quinn replied.

"Don't play games with me!" Yaddy shouted. "You and she went missing from their room, the commander is here, and he will be furious with you once he learns what you have done!"

Saying these words, it was then that the mysterious man stood in front of Quinn.

"Now, now, there is no need to shout. I'm sure there was a misunderstanding. Everyone is friends and on the same side here, right?"

The mysterious man removed his mask, and out from the back, long flowing white hair was seen. There were audible gasps in the room as they saw who it was, and soon everyone understood why he was able to put up a match against Peter.

"Commander Andy!" Yaddy said, immediately getting on one knee.

"The commander?" Quinn thought. "Does that mean he's the leader of the vampire corps? The leader is right here in front of me. I don't have to go to earth?"

"Who?..." Peter said out loud.

*****

# Chapter 1648: The Corps Leader

It hadn't been long since Quinn had woken up, but according to what he had learnt so far, the quickest way for him to learn what happened to the Cursed faction and the events of when he was in slumber was by getting to Earth.

This was because Logan Green, one of the core members back then, was currently on Earth. Quinn believed he would give him all the answers. However, he didn't expect that while he was here on Mars, he would encounter one of the higher-ups in the power hierarchy of the world and someone who could also take him to Earth.

This person was the commander of the Vampire Corps. Quinn assessed him; he looked like quite a strong vampire or subclass now that he knew him better, and after seeing him go up against Peter, he understood how someone like him could become a leader, at least based on their strength.

"He isn't anyone I recognise from back then... but I have to convince him to bring me to Earth either way. Perhaps the easiest way would just be to tell him who I am; whether he believes me or not will be another thing, but we can deal with that as it comes." Quinn thought.

Thanks to Commander Andy's intervention, it looked like Yaddy could not go on a wild rant. Instead, they left the bar area and headed straight for the Vampire Corps base. The group stopped at what looked like a luxury lounge.

There were several seats, fancy glasses, even some raw meat stored away to be consumed whenever the guest desired. It was quite the luxurious place which surprised Quinn a bit since most of the Vampire Corps unit was uniform and disciplined.

Lucia was already present in the room when they stepped in and some lieutenants were watching over her. In fact, all of the lieutenants were invited, including Mitchell, whom Quinn was pleasantly surprised to see.

"I should talk to him about those other followers and see if he knows anything." Quinn thought. "Please, everyone, relax. It looks like Yaddy has already decided to make this place a paradise for himself, and he's only been here six months."

Andy joked as he went to grab himself some of the meat displayed in the huge fridges placed on the side... Yaddy was nervous about the comments, while Andy was calmer than ever.

He was so laid back, the polar opposite of Yaddy, that Quinn wondered if it was an act and if he should be a little worried. Grabbing a metal box, Andy started to eat away, and after he was done with his food, he patted his stomach.

Although at the moment, he had some clothes covering his armour, Quinn could tell, thanks to the inspect skill, that Andy had a piece of demon tier armour underneath, which was expected.

After all, a thousand years had gone past, and the leader of the Vampire Corps not having any protective gear would be quite odd. The reason for him covering it in the first place was due to others recognising him, and it was the same with the mask.

Now that he didn't have to worry about that, he removed the large overcoat, revealing his muscular arms and his black and red armour-like chest piece.

"I feel much better," Andy said as he stretched his arm a couple of times. "Now, since not everyone here seems to know me, I think I should introduce myself." Andy looked towards Peter, who had made quite the big comment in the ring.

It had caused some of the other members to raise their eyebrows, but Andy just laughed it off, even though it was strange that someone in the Vampire Corps wouldn't even know what the leader looked like.

"I am the Commander and leader of the Vampire Corps Unit, Andy Sanguines. On the way here I asked about you and your group... Nate, was it? Apparently, you have done a lot in the short time you were here. It seems that Nate went toe to toe with Jake Green, Peter faced a wave of a level four horde all on his own. And then, Nate went on to finish the final wave by himself while also using the influence skill on everyone including General Yaddy. Did I miss anything?" Andy asked, looking at Yaddy, who was a little surprised.

He had learnt that the Commander had only just decided to come over.

Due to the meeting with the dhampirs, he was in the area and didn't plan a visit to the base, but after learning about Jessica's presence, the latter had decided to come.

"When did he even have the time to learn about this?" Yaddy thought. His worries were coming true. The Commander already knew that transpired in the base today.

"Honestly, I would have thought most of it was exaggerated tales, but after seeing the two of you for myself, it seems like there was some truth in them."

"The good news is, it doesn't seem like you are working with the Red Vampires since you have even reported a group of Red Vampire infiltrators."

"What if they did that just to get us to trust them more and grow in the ranks quickly?!" Yaddy said, worried about his position and said whatever came to his mind.

But upon hearing his words, Andy just shrugged his shoulders. "I very much doubt that. You see that chest piece he is wearing?" Andy pointed.

"That belongs to the 'Graylash' leader Zinon. Now, not many have seen it, so I don't blame you if you don't recognise it, but if the 'Graylash' leader trusted him enough to give him that, he has earned my trust. Now, I can't deny that I have a high-level interest in you and your group, but don't worry, I will ask those questions in due course. I have some guesses and ideas, but there is one thing I don't understand."

Why is a group of strong, high ranking vampires travelling with Jessica?" Looking around the room, that's when Quinn noticed that Jessica hadn't been invited, and there was also something strange that had been asked before about her as well.

"Where is Jessica?" Quinn asked, looking at Lucia.

But someone else opened his mouth before Lucia could respond. "You helped her escape, don't try to play stupid. I still can't fully trust you; who knows how you got that armour, it might be fake. How could an unknown vampire like yourself have the trust of everyone?" It was Yaddy.

Quinn ignored him and waited for Lucia's reply.

"She escaped." Lucia finally spoke. She had been silent for the entire time ever since Quinn left. She felt like she had been swept up in this madness but knew she needed to say something now.

"She said that she didn't want to bring our group any trouble, and it would be best if she parted with the group."

Hearing this, Yaddy's frustration grew tenfold, while Andy just let out a big sigh.

"That girl is running away from her responsibilities and is acting quite selfish. Anyway, I don't think she left too long ago; she couldn't have gone far. Send out a team and bring her back. Don't hurt her; just tell her that the commander wishes to speak to her and make things clearer."

"Wait!" Quinn said, just as the Lieutenants were about to move out. "Before you follow his order, I still see Jessica as part of my group, and I won't allow you guys to hurt her. So first, I want to know why Jessica is so important to you?"

Honestly, Lucia was curious about this as well. Was it because she was a Dhampir or at least part dhampir? Was she a part of an experiment that the Vampire Corps had been performing secretly and didn't want to get leaked, or perhaps she's a weapon against the dhampirs?

"Look, I really want to work with you two." Andy finally said. "And I'm really an easy-going guy, but the matter with Jessica also involves the humans, not just the Vampire Corps, and I really don't know who you guys are. At the same time, this is an urgent matter due to the meeting I just came back from, so... I don't think I can answer your question."

It was then that Quinn came to a decision. Considering everything, it seemed like the right time, so he lifted his hand and held out one finger.

The eyes of everyone were on him as they were expecting him to do something, but that's when with a single tap, Quinn touched the tip of his nose, and several cracks appeared on his face.

# Chapter 1649: Shackles

It wasn't in Jessica's plan to leave so early. At some point, she thought that she might have to, but with everything going on, and event after event coming up, the thought that this would have to happen one day kind of just slipped to the back of her mind.

Everyone just used their wristwatches for ID purposes. Of course, usually there would be identification methods that linked each person or their own wristwatch, but she hadn't left the Vampire Corps without learning a thing or two, after all, it was also part of their training as well.

Now, with a new ID, she headed to the space station, paid for a spaceship taxi and just headed for another city. Where she would go, she had no idea. In the first place, she didn't have the funds to go back to the 'Graylash' planets like she originally wanted.

"Maybe I should try to become a Traveller again, and then earn income that way and live my life." Jessica thought while she was in the spaceship. "Ah, why does my life have to suck... Seriously, what did I do to deserve any of this? If I'm not being chased by the Dhampirs, then it's the Vampire Corps... and if not them, then the other guys... I just want to do my own thing."

While lamenting her own situation, Jessica couldn't help but think about her companions. Although her decision to accompany 'Nate's little entourage had ended up leading her to more trouble than she had ever imagined, in a way it had felt truly liberating. At no point in time had the others demanded for her to do anything against her own interest.

"Here I was hoping that I might have gotten to travel to Earth somehow... maybe, I could have explained myself there... Just what was I thinking? Getting to Earth without showing my face... I seriously believed I could help those guys, yet I didn't even get the chance to do anything... somehow, I ended up being the most useless of them until the end." Jessica sighed.

Eventually the ship landed, and straight after going through the checks, the 'vampire' entered the new citv. She did have to sneak Dast the sensors but city. She did have to sneak past the sensors, but given her experience, it wasn't too hard. This was due to the facial recognition they also had for new entrants. They were always strict with security when someone came in from a spaceship rather than on foot.

After a tiring time sneaking around, Jessica had made it to another city. It was smaller than the one they were at, and there was a Vampire Corps base here as well, though it was merely a quarter of the size of the one she had just escaped. It was more to just keep the order and protect from small beast attacks here and there, it was also one located far away from where the others were as well.

"If only I had half the power of that Nate guy. He was kinda cool with his Influence skill. I wish I would be that powerful, maybe I could simply make everyone forget about my condition."

Walking through the city, Jessica continued to think of the others, yet sooner or later her thoughts always gravitated to the original vampire. She hadn't noticed it while travelling with him, but at one point she had become quite obsessed with him.

Perhaps it was due to a vampire's nature of looking up towards those with real power. Then again, perhaps it was his seemingly kind and caring character. He had always done his best to protect all of them, whenever they needed it. Jessica still remembered her first encounter with him and how rudely she had treated him, yet he never held a grudge against her.

"It's truly a shame, if only he was a bit more handsome with a more memorable face, I would have already tried to snatch him." Jessica giggled to herself at the thought. "Not that I could ever think about that type of stuff anyway.'"

Once again, Jessica found herself in front of the Travellers centre. This city, although smaller, had more humans in it. Since there wasn't just a Vampire Corps base, but also a regular military run by the Green family.

However, here she was hoping that she wouldn't have too much of the same issue, since she could just make a team of mostly vampires. Heading inside, she still looked around the place cautiously checking to see if she could see anyone.

When looking, she saw the back of one of the Travellers neck, there was a tattoo of a sword. Immediately, this sent shivers running through Jessica's entire body.

"They're here... do they already know that I'm on Mars and no longer on 'Graylash' planets... no, that shouldn't be possible." Jessica thought.

There was the off chance that they were just here by pure chance, but either way she wasn't going to risk it and decided to head back out of the building. She walked quickly, almost running, but not quite, paying attention to not make it too obvious.

Having finally gone out of the building, she was relieved, but as she looked in front of her, she could see a man just standing there with his arms crossed. Looking at his hand, he too had a tattoo of a blade on his hand.

"Calm down, it might just be a fashion statement to get swords and stuff tattooed on your hand." Jessica thought, already gathering some of her string powers in her hand.

Smiling, the man clicked his fingers, and suddenly she no longer could see people around her. There were no buildings, crowds of people. No, she was on the hard red desert like ground in the middle of nowhere, and standing opposite her was the same man.

"Jessica Clark, don't you think he's waited long enough?" The man before her asked as he clicked his fingers once more. Following the sound, more people started to appear, all with the same tattoo. Each time he clicked his fingers a new person appeared, until a total of six of them had her surrounded. Immediately, Jessica pulled out her daggers.

"We can do this the hard way, if you wish, but there is no need for us to fight. We both know that there is only one outcome to this, so please make this easy for us." The clicking man requested.

"I... I want to speak to Andy first! Or Logan! Let me speak to either one of them. I promise I will comply, just let me speak to one of them first." Jessica pleaded, not liking her odds.

The people that had surrounded her, all of them were human, not a single one of them was a vampire or Dhampir, nor were they from the 'Graylash' family, yet for some reason, noble vampire like her that had skills, was afraid and knew that she wouldn't be able to fight out of this one.

"Don't you think you had multiple chances to do that anyway? It's time we took things into our own hands." The man nodded his head, giving her a toothy grin. "Now are you going to come peacefully... or shall I continue bringing more of us?"

Even though she knew she was going to lose this fight, Jessica decided to fight anyway. Her single eye started to glow. They already knew that she had run away, so why should she make it easy for them?

Immediately, she charged forward and swung both her daggers, releasing out two lines of yellow aura.

One of the six guys that had cut off her path of retreat ran forward, taking the hit on his body, the yellow aura struck him causing his limbs to fall off, but they regenerated on the spot. The man continued to run forward towards Jessica without a care for his life.

Seeing this, she immediately went to slice towards his neck, cutting the man's head off.

Successfully having killed the first one, Jessica went on to move to the next, yet felt someone grab her from behind, which turned out to be a body without a head.

The next second, Jessica could feel her body's weight increase by multiple times. From the corner of her eye she saw one of the tattooed men point at her, seemingly the case of it.

Then she felt herself getting drowsy all of a sudden.

"Damn it... I wasn't even able to put up a fight against them... damn these Chained..." Jessica thought as she fell asleep.
