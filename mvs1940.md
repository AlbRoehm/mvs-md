# Chapter 1940 Celestial Blood Charge




The amount of Celestial energy that had been used was thankfully along the lines of Quinn's expectations. He wanted to have over 100,000 points for any battles he did have against Celestials. With his own strength and this, it seemed enough to take on others.

Since Quinn was a fighter in the first place, and didn't rely a lot on the Celestial energy, using his Celestial points to make Celestial weapons was better for him. Then again, he needed to use more energy on the new weapons as well. On top of that, there was another quest, the quest to make a God Slayer weapon.

'Wow, now that I think about it, I need to have quite a bit of Celestial points. I might have to start getting more people to complete the condition at this rate,' Quinn thought. Although there were many things that were holding him back from doing so, one of them was getting addicted to this feeling.

The good news was that the active skills that were on the armor set were still there. In other words, there were no changes. There was nothing lost in the process of making the weapon. However, with them now being Celestial weapons, there were some bonuses that made Quinn grin widely from ear to ear.

[Celestial Resistance]

[The item is resistant to Celestial energy from the user and, to some degree, from attacks containing Celestial energy.]

This passive skill was something that was now on every single one of the armor pieces that had been created. Before, when Quinn would use his Celestial blood or activate the energy in his body, it would cause the armor to deteriorate.

This was also the reason why he was unable to use his Celestial energy along with the Blue Fang set. However, the Demon tier wings were somewhat fine as they had the passive ability of healing.

'Now I will be able to use the armor set while using my celestial energy for attacking as well. There's no need to use my Celestial blood to form an armor. On top of that, there's a natural resistance to Celestial powers, putting me more on an even playing field with the other gods.'

From what Quinn had learnt in the Celestial space, most Celestials weren't good fighters. Instead, it was their Celestial energy which made them all troublesome to some degree. Now, with this armor, it would be like fighting just anyone else, but that wasn't the limit of what the armor could do.

[Celestial Blood Charge]

[Celestial Blood Charge is a skill that can be used to reset the active skills of the armor set. There are two uses of Celestial Blood Charge. Using the skill will take up Celestial energy, as well as the user's blood.]

[1: If skills have already been used, Celestial Blood Charge will take 50 percent of the user's health to reset the cooldown on the armor's skills. If health is below ten percent, the skill will not work.]

[2: Celestial Blood Charge can also be used while a skill is currently active, allowing the user to continue the usage of the current skill. The amount of blood and Celestial energy taken will be relative to when the skill is used after the skill has gone past its initial time.]

'It's been a while since I've had to worry about skills like this,' Quinn thought.

What he meant by this was the fact that the skill took his health away. Ever since gaining the title Ruler of Blood, using blood aura and blood skills didn't take any of Quinn's health. So, there was no need for him to worry.

However, injuring himself so he could use his Celestial blood did. Now, it looked like his new Celestial items would use up some amount of blood, just like the old days.

In any case, these skills are impressive. I have used Nitro Accelerate a number of times when I was in a pinch in the past, and now with these skills, I can continue to use them. When going up against a group of enemies or a tough opponent, this will be a good option to have. The Celestial upgrade has improved this armor beyond belief, but it does make me wonder.'

'Would normal users be able to use it? Due to the requirements to use some of the skills, it was almost like the armor knew that this piece would be kept for me to use.'

Regardless, there was no need for Quinn to think about that. For now, he was glad to find out he could use his Celestial energy on more items than before. However, he needed to save his Celestial points for more items, and those were the ones coming toward him.

Turning around, Quinn could sense an energy, an energy that was familiar to him in the room. Ever since he entered the room, he could sense this energy, but he had ignored it because he was unable to see anything, assuming it wasn't hostile. Surprisingly, this energy came from the mold next to the furnace at the very back of the room.

'In the video, that was where Alex was dragged to… so he should be around here, I hope.'

Taking a step closer, the energy radiated with greater fervor, seemingly reacting to Quinns footsteps. Still, he looked around, trying to find some answers to where Alex could have gone. He was still too far away to see what was inside of the molds that were used to create his weapons as they were quite deep, so it just looked like two metal boxes from a distance.

Taking yet another step, Quinn clenched his fists, and his bangs started to elongate as energy began pouring out of him. That was because, out of those metal caskets, what he had seen in the video had come out. Several blood-like tentacles that were as thick as snakes but seemed infinitely long hovered above them.

'It was these things… these were the things that took Alex!'

Walking forward, Quinn was ready to slice them up and look at what was in the metal crates. Not long after, they all charged at him, prompting Quinn to throw out his hand, only to suddenly stop midway. The reason why he did so was because the blood-like tentacles, the hundreds of thread-like snakes that had been made, had all stopped as well.

'I see….now I have an idea of what happened. It really was my fault, but I had no clue something like this was going to happen,' Quinn thought as he unclenched his hand, with the blood snakes retreating back into the molding.

The energy that was coming off them, wasn't just similar to Quinn, it was Quinn's very own Celestial blood. Somehow, the blood he had given to Alex to use had managed to turn somewhat sentient, trying to consume whatever came close to it.

'Logan did the right thing to close this place off, otherwise there would have been a few other casualties as well.. does this mean, Alex… you really…? No, I can't be so sure. I have to find out what happened,' Quinn thought as he continued to walk forward. 'It's a good thing that I came down here on my own. If not, maybe the others would have been dragged into this as well.'

Walking forward, images were appearing in Quinn's head. He imagined that, in the metallic molds where weapons were created, he would see blood and parts of a blood fairy. He had to shake these feelings, these images, as he continued to move forward

What was meant to be a grand moment of unveiling his new weapons that would help in battle, had become a nightmare for Quinn. That was until he had finally reached the two metal molds, placing both his hands on them as he looked down.

'These.these are the weapons that Alex made for me. These are the weapons that were made with my Celestial blood and the Demon tier crystals.'

Seeing them, Quinn was tempted to pick them up, just find out what these things could do. After all, it was something beyond what he could imagine. Never did he think in his life he would be holding something like this.

*****

# Chapter 1941 Duel Weapons




Quinn really didn't know what to expect from Alex's creation. For one, he was actually thinking that the weapon would just be a single item, and here it was, two items lying out there. On top of that, this was not just any weapon but one that was frequently used in the past, but only seen quite recently.

'I can't believe Alex would make something like this for me? Was there a reason… I guess in the end they would have their use, and if Alex created them, then it has to be for a good reason, there has to be a reason why he created these.'

Before picking them up, Quinn had decided to use his inspect skill, just to make sure they were the items he had been expecting.

[Altandermite Celestial Dual Blood Guns]

[These dual handguns have been made using one of the hardest materials in the Universe. It would be hard to come by anything that would be able to destroy these. The weapons also have been given a god-like energy causing them to pulsate and search for life and new blood.]

The description didn't give much help as to what these guns could do, but just as requested, it had been made using the celestial blood from himself. The one thing that was worrying for Quinn was the description at the end, as it stated it searched for blood.

'Is this what happened to… Alex? And these guns, just how helpful will they be?' Quinn reached out, heading to pick one of them up, to see what effects it had.

Guns had a strange history on earth. From what Quinn could remember, before his time and before the first Dalki war, guns and weapons of almost all sorts were banned due to the humans worrying that they would kill each other in an all out war.

However, they had made a recent return just before the fight against the Dalki. Because of the period where humans had stopped using weapons of mass destruction and guns, it had caused this type of technology to halt and it had not advanced further like it had done in the past.

In the end, even when the Dalki did attack, with the use of guns, battle tanks and more, nearly all of it was unable to pierce the hard outer skin of the Dalki. It was useless, with only an atomic bomb being somewhat useful, but the Dalki had targeted most of the nuclear stations and the atomic bombs that did get used on the large Dalki ships, had been blocked by some strange force field at the time, that later they found out was powered by beast crystals.

It was only when returning, a 1000 years later, that Quinn had witnessed the use of guns again, and that was from members of Pure. Where they were able to use special guns to draw out the Qi energy in an attack.

Picking up the hand gun, it felt nice in Quinn's hand. The gun was solid black in colour, with streaks of gold around the top. However, the strangest part of the gun design was perhaps the trigger. There was nothing to pull on, and instead it looked like a sharp needle.

The needle itself was red, and pulsating, and when Quinn picked it up, he could sense it, the gun it seemed almost alive.

'What am I meant to do? How do I even use this weapon? The inspect skill didn't come up with any active skills, only the description of it.'

Holding the gun, there was something drawing him to it, and that's when he placed his finger right by the trigger. In an instant, the strange needle moved, digging into his finger, and around the handle of the gun Quinn could feel several spikes and the same type of pain enter the palm of his hand.

'This piece of Sh*t!' Quinn shouted internally as it hurt quite a bit, which was a surprise, and it wasn't done there. Quinn could feel it drawing out of his body all different types of energy without him even trying to use it.

At first he could feel his red vampire aura flow right into the gun, after that, there was his Qi energy, his celestial energy, and even his shadow and MC cells could be felt being drawn into the weapon.

It wasn't a draining feeling as it almost felt like just a spec of energy was transported into the weapon itself, and it had soon stopped.

'What just happened… why would the gun do something like that?'

[Inspect]

[The weapon has registered its one and only user. The celestial energy from the gun and user have matched. You may now use the gun's active skills]

[The Blood gun is able to enhance any type of power that is used to energise the weapon, giving each of them unique properties when used with the gun. The following skills can now be used with the gun.]

[Celestial bullet - A bust of condensed celestial energy. Can be used to quickly transfer celestial energy to others when shot at dedicated followers, or used as an attack against others.]

'This seems a bit extra, I mean I can transfer energy to dedicated followers whenever I want anyway, but maybe it can tell my intentions. Maybe there is a way I can transfer energy to those that aren't dedicated followers in rapid succession.

'Also, if I had this type of skill in the celestial space when I was fighting against all the others, it would have come in handy. The question is just how much does this gun enhance the powers of my bullets?'

[Blood Forest bullet - A blood bullet is shot out, and if hitting a target successfully, it will drain blood of the target that has been hit, giving the user blood energy, as well as any additional effects from absorbing blood]

[Qi bullet - Using the User's Qi, a bullet will be shot out, giving effects of the third stage of Qi. The bullet is in a condensed form allowing it to not only be an invisible shot of power, but a powerful one at that.]

[Shadow Bullet - Depending on how the User whishes to use the shadow, the shadow bullet can be used in a number of ways, along with the shadow ability of the user.]

[Note: Since this weapon was made using the blood of a celestial, it is unable to be marked. It is already a celestial weapon that can only be used with those that have the same type of energy as the celestial.]

Looking at the effects of the four different types of bullets alone, Quinn wondered just how useful they would be. In the first place, Quinn mostly used his blood aura to fight at long range, while using his gauntlet's fist to fight at close range.

Now, he had even more options compared to before with these guns as well. However, he would have to practice being quite a good shot, unless he could direct the bullets just like he could with his blood control.

He wanted to test out the skills and see just how powerful the weapon was, but now wasn't the time, he still needed to find out a number of things.

​ 'Still, with two guns, does that mean I could use a mixture of the different bullets as well? What effect would that create?'

Thinking about this, Quinn looked at the other weapon that was still in the mold, and strangely, it didn't look like an exact copy of the one he was holding. It made him think, did that mean the weapon also had different effects, or was there a different reason.

With this excitement at hand, Quinn went ahead and picked up the weapon. Once again he placed his finger in the place where the trigger would be in a normal gun, and now his other hand was pricked several times.

'Wait… this isn't the same as before… I can feel it. There is another energy… there is another energy in the weapon that's not my own.'

That was when something strange started to appear from the gun, just like before, the blood tentacles had come out of the gun and were floating in the air.

"Quinn… Quinn!"

"Huh, that voice?"

"You can hear me, Quinn? It's me… it's me, Alex!"

"Alex?" Quinn turned his head looking around in the room. "Where are you? I have been looking everywhere for you and I wanted to thank you for making the weapons."

There was silence for a moment, and that silence had told Quinn everything, as for one, why the voice he was hearing was in his own head.

"Quinn… I'm in your hand now, I'm in the weapon you are holding." Alex explained.

# Chapter 1942 Special Celestial Weapon




Due to the turn of events, Quinn couldn't help but slap his hand on his forehead as he shook it in disbelief. Because it seemed like Alex, soul or spirit, consciousness, whatever the case was, it was now really in the weapon.

"So the footage Logan showed me was indeed real, and the weapon started attacking you?" Quinn asked.

"It was so painful. Those damned blood snakes of yours pierced my body and began drawing my blood, and somehow I started to turn into particles before I was placed into the weapon. Honestly, until you reached out and placed your hand in the weapon, I was fading along. Quinn, you have to help. You have to help me get out of this situation!"

Alex's voice was enough to show how much he was suffering, and with every word he said, it sounded like he was on the verge of tears, which hurt Quinn more because he was the one that got the former into this situation.

"I can't promise anything, as I really don't understand it myself," Quinn replied. "But if it's like the past, then if we use Shiro's power, or maybe even Sil's, then we should definitely be able to help you get out of the weapon, but I'm not so sure about getting your body back to the way it used to."

There was a slight groan from Alex as he imagined himself never being able to make a weapon again, but in the end, he could live with that because the weapon he had made now was already a masterpiece.

"I guess we'll just have to wait and see for now, but it's not a complete loss. I can still control the gun to some degree, among other things."

Saying these words, the red threads that were as thick as a snake came out of the gun and were dangling about. This was all Alex's doing. He had control over the weapon to a degree which was why he could do all of this in the first place.

"If worse comes to worst, maybe I can just use these strange blood tentacles to make weapons, or I could just instruct you on what to do," Alex added.

Nodding along, Quinn, at this point, would agree to anything Alex suggested due to how guilty he felt. What was even crazier in his head though, was how through his life, he had so many voices in his head.

'First Vincent, then Ray, and now Alex? Does the universe just not want me to be alone in my own mind.' Quinn thought.

Although it seemed like Alex could only communicate with Quinn when he was attached to the gun because when the guns were placed in Quinn's shadow, or he let go of them, he could no longer hear Alex's voice.

"Enough of that. It is what it is." Alex noticed that Quinn was feeling a bit down. "I have already lived a good and long life thanks to you, Quinn. I wanted to create those weapons for you, and I think I have done pretty well if I say so myself.

"But I am more interested to know if this weapon is any different than the other. Only one of the weapons actually pulled me in, and if they really did use my blood, it might have messed up the composition creating something different entirely." Alex explained.

When looking at the weapon, it didn't look any different, but it did feel different. Quinn assumed this was mostly due to Alex's soul though.

"I guess there is no harm in seeing."

[Inspect]

[Altandermite Celestial Duel Blood Gun (Special)]

Now that Quinn had used the inspect skill on just one of the guns specifically, he could see that this one had a special tag that had been added to it.

[This weapon contains the soul of an ancient forger. He was one of the best forgers to ever exist, but he left the world with regret. Not being able to create the best weapons and strongest weapons the world has seen. The will of the ancient spirit has combined with the weapon giving it a few extra skills.]

'Alex was right. According to the text, the weapon really is different compared to the other one.'

Just like before, the weapon contained the same set of active skills as the other, but there were a few more differences.

[Blood fairy bullet - Part of the weapon has been made using Fairy blood, allowing the weapon to combine fairy blood with the user's own powers. The blood fairy bullet is highly effective against other vampires. If a vampire, even a powerful one, is hit by a blood fairy bullet, they will find it hard to heal.]

'This is the same effect as the blood fairy weapons that Alex made before, but now in bullet form. This would have been good to use against Laxmus, but I haven't had to fight against other vampires for a long time, so will there be any use for it?'

Thinking about this, another thought popped into Quinn's head. Bliss had stated that Erin's strength didn't just work against vampires but all creations of Immortui. So maybe the blood fairy bullet would be the same. Maybe it was an attack that could be used on the demon creations and Immortui himself.

On top of all that, there was still one more skill that could be seen.

[Absorption - This weapon is able to absorb crystals. Depending on the crystals absorbed, it will allow special types of bullets to be made. The bullets made through the absorption method will either be limited or permanent.]

'Oh, that looks like a nice skill.' Alex said after reading the text.

'Wait, you can see that?' Quinn asked.

'Yeah, I could see all of the system screens that popped up. Wait, have you always been able to see this? Is this how you could figure out what was a good weapon and a bad one?'

The thought of when the two first met was coming into Alex's head, and now it was all making sense. Quinn wasn't some type of forger or weapon expert. He had a cheat skill allowing him to see all of these things.

Although Alex was upset for a few seconds, it had been so long ago he couldn't really be so upset about it.

'Anyway, the skill is a good one. Maybe with this, you can absorb demon-tier crystals through the weapon and continue improving the weapon. Maybe with this, you might never have to get a new weapon after this again.

'And don't you have the best forger in the world?! Hahaha,' Alex shouted in excitement.

'Yeah, I really do have the best forger.'

After saying those words, and with the weapons in his hands, Quinn started to walk out of the forging room. He also turned off the equipment one by one at Alex's request, who explained to him what he needed to do.

​ One of the guns had been placed in his shadow, while the other, using the strange blood tentacles, Alex wrapped around and held onto Quinn's hand. The gun would stay on the underside of his forearm near his wrist.

This way, Quinn could still use his hands just fine and also communicate with Alex, who didn't want to be alone and left with his thoughts. When exiting the room, Logan was standing in front of him, and Fex and Minny were also present.

"I'm guessing you never managed to find him?" Logan asked.

Quinn shook his head.

"Actually, I did, but it's quite complicated. As usual, nothing is ever so easygoing these days." Quinn replied. "If you're not too busy, I could explain and talk to you, but I wanted to ask you a favour before that.

"Do you have a training room of some kind? I would like to test out the new weapons which Alex made. Um, actually, never mind that there is no need for a training room, I just need training partners. I can make my own space." Quinn said, thinking about his own Celestial space he could now create, which slowed down time.

All they were waiting, for now, was word on where Erin and Zero were. During that waiting time, Quinn was going to get as familiar with the weapons as possible.

"Sure," Logan replied. "But I assume that there is not much longer to wait now. We should get the call from Peter and Chris any moment now."

****

# Chapter 1943 It's Time




The good news was that there was no need for Quinn to use any more celestial points, since the new weapons were already celestial weapons without him having to mark them. In the future, Quinn wondered if this was a better way to make celestial weapons. Then there was no need to use any of his points.

At the end of the day, even though celestial power wasn't the end all when fighting against other celestials, it did help and on top of that, there was another reason why he needed a large amount of celestial energy, and that was his own celestial space that he could create.

Right now, not just Quinn, but also Fex were in his own private white space. Time was slowed here, allowing for Quinn and Fex to train as much as they could before they were to be called. However, it would use a large amount of celestial energy as well.

They weren't alone in the room, as there were a few robot humanoid figures with crystals embedded in their bodies.

A loud bang was heard and the robot fell to the floor, but it wasn't the only robot on the ground, there were around twenty that had been destroyed a distance away from Quinn, while Fex also had around five or so of the robots defeated around him.

"Logan sure has improved these guys, but this power, it's great, just a little hard to get used to drawing it out." Fex stated.

"Maybe that's because you're old." Quinn replied, as he looked at his gun and the distance the fallen robots were at.

"Hey, do you really have to hit me where it hurts, and besides we're technically the same age." Fex replied. "And at least I have kids to show for it. What have you done during this whole time, just slept letting your balls dry out."

It was a crude image, but Quinn couldn't help but smile, he missed the back and forth that he only really had with Fex.

Using the shadow space, Quinn had summoned more of the robots that Logan had allowed him to borrow, and was now observing Fex trying to gauge how strong he was or could be, because the one thing he didn't want to do was rush him into danger as soon as he came back.

While watching Fex, still as skillful as ever, if not more so with his strings, Quinn was actually thinking about his own weapons.

'I'm thankful for Logan giving us these robots to test out on, but it's hard to use most of the real effects of the weapons that way.' Quinn thought. 'Still, I was able to find out a couple of things. The bullets, for one, come out lightning fast and I can't really control them.'

When shooting out the bullets, Quinn thought at least with the blood aura bullets he could use his blood control to move it where he wished in the air, after the bullet was shot. However, they came out so fast that by the time he used his blood control, it was useless and the bullet was far away. He could only just shoot more bullets at his opponent.

Otherwise he would spend more time focusing on moving the bullet, rather than shooting his target which would be worse. Which was why Quinn had to use the guns more like normal guns. The problem was he wasn't the best shot.

Targets that were close, he could do well with, but far away and moving targets were troublesome, and that was what he was currently using the robots that had been provided to them for.

'What I haven't really been able to test on these robots though is the real effects that these bullets have, just the range, speed, damage, and the general power of them. Even then it's not really helpful, since a Qi bullet and a blood bullet destroys these guys in one shot. I wonder if there is a better way or opponent to train against.'

A loud bang was heard that distracted Quinn, and lifting his head, he could see Fex pulling one of the robots through the air, from four different points. The hands and the legs, and then, a glowing white fist slamming right into the robot's chest, taking out the chunk of metal that contained the beast crystal inside, stopping it from working on the spot.

"I think I can do this, I think with this I can stand on my own. I might not be able to help you fight anyone significantly stronger, but I can be by your side, especially when you take out Erin!" Fex stated, clenching his fist.

When looking over at Quinn, through his fist, he could see the other wasn't so enthusiastic.

"Quinn." Fex called out. "I'm going to ask you this, and I know it might not be fair because you were the one that gave me a second chance, but at the same time if you aren't willing to go through with this I would rather not have a second chance.

"You have already made the resolution to kill Erin right? I mean, there is no guess, she was the one that killed Samantha and no matter what the reason was, she has to feel the same pain as her."

"Of course." Quinn replied quickly. "I made the resolution a while ago. I had already made the decision to wake you up, before meeting with Bliss, that's why we were there, and I would have never woken you up unless it was for this reason.

"I just have a feeling that it might not be so easy."

There were a number of factors to take in when fighting against Erin. For one, the demon tier weapon was made from the humanoid demon tier beast, which gave her the powers of ice. On top of that there was a demon tier attachment that allowed her to have the same skills and powers with the same weapon with fire.

According to the others as well,  Erin also had a demon tier armour that seemed to allow her to negate damage in some way. Although they were unsure how it worked. There was also the dhampir's strength, and the fact that it would work against Immortui, meant that she would also get a power boost if she was to go up against Quinn.

In a way, it was better for her to fight a non-vampire like Chris, with no one around, making her significantly weaker. Out of all of those things though, the main thing that concerned Quinn was the four kings of the familiar world, just why had they all decided to team up with Erin, and just how powerful were they together?

'I just have to focus on myself, learn how to use these guns properly, and learn how to combine them with the armour in the best way. I can always go out and get some beasts to use these things on, but real people will be the problem.'

In the white space, quite a bit of time had passed. Quinn had tested the weapons on beasts and although Logan wasn't a willing genie pig, he did have others that were happy to get hit with a bullet or two to see its effects. Quinn just had to make sure he aimed at a non-lethal spot when firing.

As time went on, Quinn had figured out quite a lot about his weapons and the combinations that were possible, as well as things he wanted to test out but weren't quite sure they would work. After some time, his celestial points had run out, meaning they were now back where they started in Green Tower.

They all took a break, while Quinn's celestial points recovered, and they all thought about what to do, how to get stronger. That was until Logan had come looking for them.

Fex and Quinn were lying down in bunk beds just talking about the olden days together, how one had saved the other lives and the experiences they had gone through, when Logan had entered the room.

"I just received a message from Chris and Peter. It looks like they have found her. They know where Erin is." Logan said.

******

# Chapter 1944 Shaking Clash




Nervous energy was felt throughout the entire place, so much that it felt like the ship they were on was shaking. However there was nothing but silence as the spaceship travelled to the destination, and since it wasn't far from where they were, it would only be a matter of time until they got there.

"Okay I can't take it anymore!" Vanessa said, jumping up from her seat. "I have to say something. Look I know this is big… really big, but please remind me why we are going towards the large explosions on that planet!"

Standing by her side, Lucas, her friend, quickly pulled her back down so she was sitting in her seat again. He could feel the energy coming off from Peter and Chris. The two of them… they looked even more concerned than when they were fighting against the celestial not too long ago.

In the end, since it looked like Peter wasn't going to say anything, Chris had decided to talk to the others instead.

"I guess we are quite tense, but we have good reason to be." Chris stated. "Remember, you were the ones that chose to come along with us, that wished to film everything that happened. We have no choice, we have to go and see if Zero, and the Dhampir Queen, is on this planet.

"I just want to make everything clear, if anything was to happen, or a fight was to break out, we will not be strong enough to help you. We might not even be strong enough to protect ourselves."

Both of the two vampires gulped. Although AJ was paying them a pretty penny to be there as assistants, it was clear that they were about to jump into a pit of lava. As the ship got closer, it literally was shaking due to the shockwaves that were coming off the planet. Whatever was happening there, it was a big deal.

When Vanessa turned to AJ though, all she could see was an excited adult, one who had cameras, beast armour, and more strapped to him… ready to film everything that came his way.

"I'll be going. You two don't have to come, but if you do and do a good job protecting me just like before, I guarantee that it will be worth your while." AJ stated as he pressed a button on top of his glasses.

His current outfit reminded Peter of what Logan used to wear back in the day. His ability and powers were more suited for a role like filming, but of course his talents would have been wasted on something like that.

"I wanted to ask you a favour actually." Chris said, as he looked at all the recording equipment. "I know in the deal that was made, you promised to only film events and not live stream them without going through an editing process, but I was wondering if you would be able to set up a private live stream to the Green family."

AJ placed his finger on his chin.

"It's not hard to do at all, as long as Logan accepts. I'm more interested to know why though?"

"We made a promise." Chris replied. "We said that we would inform them when we met up with the others, and I intend to keep that promise."

Although this was true, Chris was also thinking about something else. He would keep his promise with Quinn, but there was a good chance that they would engage, and Chris was ready… ready to fight Zero head on.

'I can beat him… if it comes to it, if he really chooses to protect Erin, and is really not thinking straight. I will beat him and make him come to his senses.' Chris thought. In his head, there was a high chance that Quinn would never arrive, that they would never get help from the others, so they needed to be prepared to act.

"Peter, do you still have that large amount of energy that you were able to summon before. I think it might help us out?"

Clenching his fist, in and out, Peter looked towards the planet.

"I do, the energy inside me is still strong, but I know it is Quinn's energy, so for how long it will stay with me, it is hard to tell."

Although at times Peter was dense, he knew why Chris was asking this question, and there was a smile on his face, because Peter was ready as well, ready for a round 2 against Erin.

A larger shockwave than they had received ever before shook the whole ship, more violently than before, to the point where Lucas had stumbled a bit.

"Full speed to the planet now!" AJ shouted. "The shockwaves… they are only coming out once in a while. We are close, so we need to make it to the planet. Otherwise the next set of shockwaves might even break the ship."

The ship went full speed ahead, but rather heading straight into where the large shockwaves were coming from, they had decided to land a little ways away at first. This was on Chris's order.

'That power, I can sense it now that we are close, there is an insane amount of Qi that is being pulsated out. At first I thought it might have had something to do with the Red Heart being activated, but if this is the energy it can't be.

'The more I think about it, the more likely it is to be a fight that's going on. If that's the case, then our best opportunity might be to try and join in just after this fight is over, but who could make Zero release this much Qi energy in a fight?'

The ship had landed safely, and the shockwaves that were being sent outwards weren't felt as strong on the planet's surface.

"Remember to report to Quinn, keep filming and make sure if you see the blonde haired girl or Zero, it gets sent back to him straight away." Peter stated, as they all walked ahead.

Soon, it looked like Chris would get his answer as to just what was going on.

——

A bruised up lip, a scarred face, ripped clothing and rags that were floating out in the wind. These were just some of the visible markings that could be seen on the four that were in a fight of their lives.

Sweat was running down all four of their faces, Erin had her hand gripped tightly around her demon tier sword, the same was for Flora, although there were quite the few black markings on her face from using the abilities of the weapon.

Then there was Zero, grinding his teeth back and forth as he held a large katana sword in his hand, one that was almost the size of his entire body, but he was holding it as if it weighed the same as any other sword.

"Another attack is coming!" Agent 4 shouted.

He held out his hand, and the crown on his head started to light up. Yet, he looked nervous at the attack that was coming towards them. A large white beam of energy had hit the barrier, and the red ripples that would come when attacked appeared.

The power was holding out well, and as usual, it blocked out any attacks when using the special blood armour this way. However, the attack and beam of energy wasn't just coming from one direction.

Another attack, of the same size and sheer power, was coming from behind them, an attack so wide and large in size that it would be able to hit all four of them, even with how spread out they were. With Agent 4 still blocking the attack ahead, it would be impossible for him to block the attack that was coming from behind.

That was when Erin threw her sword into the ground, and a large ice wall appeared behind them. The attack hit the wall and had been stopped.

'It seems like we are safe, but in reality we are trapped… How, just how are we going to defeat this person?' Zero thought, and continued to grind his teeth, as this was an unexpected situation. 'And who is this guy? Why does their energy feel so similar to Master's?'

# Chapter 1945 The Challenger




It hadn't been long since Mundus had returned back to the celestial space, and when doing so, of course he was interested in one fight. A fight that was still going on at this moment. He wasn't the only one, as many of the other celestials were also interested as well.

However, Mundus wasn't watching the fight with the other celestials surrounding the orb where the planet was located. Instead, he was in his personal space, sitting on a seat and a large portal appeared above, allowing him to see the fight from several different angles as if he had an all seeing camera.

'Gorgath is fighting against them, and this group seems to have quite a few strong people with them.' Mundus stated. 'I see the mistake we have made so far. Although we have sent strong gods to fight against the god slayers, there seems to be many Earthlings that are also strong surrounding them and supporting them.

'The weak always did like to gather and stick together, but hopefully Gorgath can complete the job, and even if he doesn't there is always a plan B which is in progress, and if really necessary a plan C, but I hope I won't have to get involved myself.

'That would say something about the gods' powers if I needed to get involved, and if that was the case, I would say it was time we whipped some of the gods into action. They have had far too much of a peaceful period.'

——

Inside the celestial space, with the biggest crowd, watching the final fight that was commencing were the other gods, and of course the two favourites that loved to gossip about everything going on, and somewhat played a hand in things, was Xox, the floating ball of energy and the sea-like god, Yongbu.

"Okay, I will take the bait as usual." Yongbu sighed. "I have to admit, for once this celestial looks like they can do something, but… so far you hyped up all of the other celestials to be these strong unstoppable gods, and every single one of them was defeated.

"Which means, either these Earthlings are just that strong, or your stories are full of flare just to try to impress me."

Frustrated by the words, the ball of energy was starting to expand and retract as its energies grew.

"These are unprecedented times!" Xox shouted back, but quickly calmed his voice down when he could see a couple of others looking at him. The one thing he didn't want to do was grab attention.

"Dedicated followers fighting alongside celestials and god slayers, no one expected any of these to get involved. My information has always been 100… no 200 percent accurate, and that will never change.

"All of the celestials that were picked by Mundus were dangerous in their own right, and for their own reasons, otherwise Mundus would have never picked them for the job, and the same could be said for Gorgath as well." Xox explained, having to catch his breath since he was speaking so fast.

"Gorgath is probably the celestial with the most accolades compared to the others. If you don't know what I mean by that, I will make it quite obvious for you. Just before this fight, Gorgath himself was fighting against another God slayer, and he still has plenty of power to fight against these others."

Yongbu, who had only fought against strong beings that were getting close to the stage of god slayer, had some idea. This was a warrior fighter, who only challenged himself by fighting against other god slayers. As stated, this was one with perhaps the most experience fighting.

——

On the black, rock hard, planet, the celestial known as Gorgath was standing there strong and unhurt. There wasn't a single mark on his red skin, and his large red horn that was as long as an arm was intact as well.

"Weak." Gorgath said as he punched two of his fists together. The strange balls that looked almost like glass embedded into his body began to spin, and as they did, a strange electrical charge could be seen charging off from them.

"They sent me to deal with you all, and I can't believe someone like Immortui would have such a weak follower!"

Charging off from his position, he completely disappeared, the ground wasn't kicked up, but Gorgath was coming through the air like a frightening arrow. Seeing this, Agent 4 quickly stood in front and activated the power of the blood armour.

The ripples activated as Gorgath, crashed into the pulsating red power.  It had stopped him in his tracks and he landed on his feet. His power was radiating around him, almost making it look like he was floating down to the ground.

Raising his fist, he pounded it again, right into the wall.

"You think, something like this can stop me!"

One of the balls around Gorgath's shoulders started to spin rapidly, and the power inside him was rising up. Throwing out his fist it hit the red pulsating wall, and the whole planet shook as the attack had hit. Yet, the attack still hadn't gone through.

Gorgath had to admit that even he was shocked that somehow his attack was stopped, he had never seen anything like it, but it didn't matter. The radiating energy from his punch was still present and still pouring into the wall.

While this was the case, the strange, glass-like balls around his legs started to spin, and he moved from his position, again, this time coming from the back. As he went to throw out another fist, standing in his way this time, was a large Ice wall.

"I see, I guess you guys are showing some talent now against me, but this is useless." Gorgath stated. "Because, I like a challenge, and whatever walls stand in my way, I will bring them down!"

A ball embedded into Gorgath's shoulder spun, ones in his forearms started to spin as well and not just in one arm, but in both of them. Throwing out his punch, it had hit the ice wall, and the energy of the icewall had been activated.

Whatever attack was to hit it, it would be reflected back, and with more strength as well. This had occurred and the attack had exploded onto Gorgath's body. It had hit him harder than ever, but Gorgath looked unfazed and he hadn't left his position.

Instead, the balls on his body just began to spin faster and faster. As they did, every few seconds, a rush of energy would explode from his arms, hitting the ice wall again, and again. The attacks grew stronger, and large shockwaves of energy were blasting off, so large that they pierced the skies and would be able to be seen from a distance, from space, or even another planet.

Another large shockwave erupted from both of Gorgath's fists, and it was then that cracks started to appear in the form of the ice wall.

Erin stood there with the sword held in her hand, while Flora was standing next to her, also holding her blade tightly as well.

"We will take this person down together." Flora stated. "I will be of help to you, I promise you that."

The cracks appeared larger in the large ice wall and any second now they were going to break. Meanwhile the attack that Agent 4 was stopping had come to an end allowing him to turn around as well.

'This person… I'm not getting the same amount of energy I would usually get when fighting vampires.' Erin thought. 'This battle, unlike the one I fought against Laxmus, will be incredibly difficult. This celestial is strong. I will need all the help I can get, if we are to win this battle.'

It was then that Erin could feel an incredibly large amount of energy by her side, but it wasn't coming from Flora, instead it was from another.

"It looks like I will have to get involved in this fight. I had wished to see your true skill, but we all need to get out of this one alive." Zero stated as he pulled out his sword, and held it down by his side.

# Chapter 1946 100,000 Souls




The surge of energy exploded and with it the ice barrier had scattered into a thousand pieces, falling onto the ground. For a second, Erin was dumbfounded, she held her demon tier sword by the side of her face and twisted the handle again, switching it from its ice form to its fire form.

The blade glowed slightly red, and once again she slammed it into the ground, activating the third ring. With it a large wall of fire rose up again right in front of all of them.

'It looks like that blood armour that Agent 4 is using is able to block the attacks better than my walls. If worse comes to worse, we are just going to have to buy time for him to block attacks while I figure something out.'

Something that hadn't happened to Erin for a long time, had occured today, and that was hesitancy. She was struggling with what to do, trying to find an answer to winning this fight.

Using her raw power for this one wasn't going to work out. While in the middle of her thoughts, there was one person who had run past her, and it wasn't Agent 4 like she was expecting.

Long black hair could be seen flowing in front of her, and a middle aged man with his hand on the sword in his sheath jumped right through the fire.

'Zero… but what is he doing, how is he going to get through the fire?'

As Zero got close to the fire, without even having to draw his blade, it looked as if something was pulling the fire apart with its bare hands, almost creating an opening looking similar to that of an eye.

Instead of using her eyes to try and figure out what was happening in front of her, Erin resorted to using her ability. In doing so she could see it, it was a strange form of the second stage of Qi.

The Qi that was surrounding Zero, it was immense, powerful, condensed and deadly sharp allowing for Zero to even push the flames apart. The second Zero broke through the flames, he could see Gorgath right there.

Pulling out the sword from his sheath, a large amount of energy erupted at one single point, it was condensed to the tip of the weapon. The fine edge of the katant like blade was lighting up in a slightly bright pink.

"100,000 Soul strike!" Zero shouted.

Gorgath had both of his hands pulled back, ready to throw out a punch, the strange balls on his body were spinning as he was ready to take down the flame wall.

'I never expected them to attack this soon, I thought they were cowering and hiding behind their defenses.' Gorgath thought.

At the same time, the blade coming out of the sheath moved far faster than he expected and it had slashed across his chest. A large line of energy, as long as a mountain, erupted and sent Gorgath hurling back in the other direction.

He skidded across the ground a good few metres before he stopped himself, creating sparks behind his body to slow him down. He rubbed his fingers across his chest and could feel an indent and also blood dripping down from his chest.

"So you are one of these so-called gods, right?" Zero said, as he pointed out his sword. "I know a little bit about you, I have been told a few things you see, from one of you."

Gritting his teeth, Gorgath stood up, but he didn't look in pain, if anything he looked absolutely fine, and still full of energy.

"You, the marking… you are a dedicated follower of Immortui correct? If so, then why are you getting involved in this fight? Do you think because you serve him that I will not harm you?"

Zero hearing this smiled.

"Oh, so you know the one I serve, that is interesting, it seems he is a great person even among the gods like he said. Either way, the power I just used against you, has nothing to do with him, that is all of my own, and there is still a lot where that came from."

Gorgath's eyes widened hearing these words, and he was reconsidering what to do for a second, as he saw all four of them.

'That power, he's right, it hardly had any celestial energy behind it at all, but then how did a human get so strong, and more so, the power that he did use, it didn't completely feel like it was his. The strange energy he summoned… what is it?'

The energy that was somewhat unfamiliar to Gorgath was the Qi that Zero was using, since he hadn't fought earthlings or humans before. Yet he was right about his thoughts.

Although the energy was a part of Zero and had come from his body, it didn't feel connected to or part of him. This was all because of the attack that Zero had used.

The reason why he had called it the 100,000 soul strike, was because that was the amount of Qi energy that Zero had obtained over the course of a 1000 years.

It was the amount of Qi energy he had used in that single strike, and was why it was able to do such a thing to a celestial, even without having celestial energy in the attack.

The celestials got their energies from those that were alive. In a way, Zero was doing the same, but he was taking the energy directly from the lives, and using it this way was far more powerful than the gods could have imagined.

Gorgath lifted his hand up, the others braced themselves as they were ready for an attack. The fist was thrown but not out towards themselves, instead a loud thud was heard and a slight mark could be seen on the side of Gorgath's cheek.

"Since when have I been the type to worry? I don't care who you serve. My orders have come from Mundus, and even Immortui himself would be a fool to try and go against them. Since you stand in my way, I will take out you and every single one."

For a second, Zero thought about moving to the side. If he claimed that he wouldn't get in the celestial's way, there was a good chance that he would even let him and another live.

However, right now Zero had to choose his sides carefully, and in this situation, he was far more interested in Erin, rather than a god like this that could do nothing for him.

Stretching his arms out, a total of four orbs on each of Gorgath's arms started to spin, then the two stationed around his chest and the rest of his body. Sparks continued to flicker off his skin and connect with each of the orbs.

The ground underneath Gorgath's feet had crumbled but from his sheer power, he was still levitating and floating in the same space.

"Shouldn't we attack him now, while he is powering up?" Flora asked.

"Don't worry, I'm ready, whatever comes our way I should be able to block it." Agent 4 claimed, with his hand held out.

Erin wasn't too sure about that. Although she was confident in the blood armour's power, she wasn't in Agent 4 himself. His strength might be strong compared to human standards but here in a battle like this, Agent 4 was quite slow.

One would just have to move faster than the speed it took for him to cast his shield to get through it. Racking her brain, Erin knew this was going to be an annoying fight, unless Zero had any more tricks up his sleeve.

'I can probably pull through this fight if I used everything I had, but that leaves me open… open for another attack. I can't use all of my energy, just in case.'

Finishing this thought, she turned her head, as her ability had latched onto new energies, new energies that were coming their way from the side, and it was ones she had come to recognise quite recently.

'What are those idiots doing here… this situation has just gotten a lot worse.' Erin thought.

# Chapter 1947 Qi Burst




After landing on the strange dark surface planet, it didn't take long for the group to head toward where they believed Zero and Erin currently were.

Since Chris felt a significant presence of Qi, he was sure that he would at least encounter Zero on this planet. As everyone ran ahead, the entire group did their best to keep up with Chris, who was leading the charge.

He was the fastest out of them all. However, Aj and the vampires could keep up somewhat, especially Aj, who had a speed ability. But, unsurprisingly, even with the ability, Aj was slower than others, which showed just how different the others were in comparison.

'How long are these guys going to run for?' Aj thought. 'At this rate, I'm going to run out of MC cells before we even reach wherever these guys are going.'

Eventually though, Chris stopped dead in his tracks, not moving closer to the source of energy and the others also stopped nearby. Immediately, Aj could see people up ahead, and from the description he had heard, he knew that one of them was the apparent Dhampir Queen.

Pulling out his camera and the rest of his equipment with drones and more, Aj began to film this moment, zooming in on each of the current and present people.

'That's Agent Four. He hasn't shown his face much around Pure, but I definitely recognize him. Then there's Flora, the representative of the Dhampirs, she is a familiar face as well, as for the other two…they must be Zero and the Dhampir queen.

'I can't believe it. Two faces practically unknown to the outside world are now here, right in front of me. I wish I could live stream this right now!' Aj was cursing at himself inwardly. 'If the world sees these two on one screen, it would surely create one of the highest viewed live streams in history.'

It would only take a push of a button to go live, and Aj was tempted, but he had made a promise to the others. So, for now, he would just have to record this himself, and once edited and filmed out, the whole world would be able to watch whatever was going to happen today.

However, what was interesting was how everyone was positioned, it was clear that they were in a fight, but they weren't in a fight with each other. Instead, there was a red being, one that looked inhuman but with a human body shape.

'What…is that, the energy that is radiating off it, it feels…'

"It's the same again," Peter commented. "The same b*stard thing that fought us on the Graylash planet."

"You mean, a celestial?" Chris asked.

Although Chris was better at sensing different types of energy, Peter was more familiar with Celestial energy due to what was running through his veins and how much of it because Quinn had yet to take it back.

'Did I hear them correctly?' Aj thought. 'Did they say this was a celestial? They really appear all over the place, and if they are fighting the others, What is their goal? Why not attack the humans or the vampires?' Something wasn't adding up, but that wouldn't stop Aj from filming every moment and figuring out the rest of this later.

——

Erin glanced to the side to look at the others.

'They aren't moving forward at the moment, but now that these guys are here, it will be a pain. If I use everything I have now and get into a weakened state, they will certainly pounce at me.'

At the same time, they had run out of options because whatever Gorgath had been doing, he had stopped. His skin was now glowing a brighter red, the orbs on his body were still spinning, but the sparks were no longer flickering all around him.

Flying straight ahead, Gorgath zapped like a lightning bolt. Agent Four went to lift his hand, but just as Erin expected, it was too slow to activate the barrier, and Gorgath was already right by his side.

"Your power, it's extremely troublesome, so it would be best to get rid of you first." Gorgath lifted his hand and threw it down, aiming right for the crown right on top of Agent Four's head.

A clang resounded as the two blows met, and the red hand touched the pink glowing weapon. Just then, a strike came from below as Zero repositioned his foot and blocked the attack. It was also done with a single hand.

With his other hand free, he put his palm on the skin of the others.

'A direct Qi strike from here will do some internal damage.' Zero was ready to unleash his power, but getting close to the skin had caused strange red sparks to flicker, and before Zero knew it, he and Agent Four were zapped by the energy.

Although it looked somewhat similar to the lighting powers, it felt nothing like it, as they felt as if their insides were melting. Regaining composure, Zero used as much of his Qi as he could to protect his insides from giving out. The problem was he needed to hold onto agent four and do the same, protecting him as much as possible.

'Agent 4 is needed for the blood crystal to work properly. We still need him!' Zero assessed. Agent Four still had a part to play in their plan, so he couldn't let the latter die here.

As he gripped tightly around his blade again and was ready to strike, another sword slashed, and a loud explosion went off, creating a dust cloud and rocks to be flown up in the air right in front of them.

Both Zero and Agent Four were hit by the explosion and sent tumbling to the ground. They were somewhat hurt by the explosion but were also thankful since the two of them had been broken off from whatever energy it was attempting to enter their body.

The explosions didn't stop there as they continued to go one after the other. A sword was seen being flung through the dust clouds, and one after the other would go off.

"I'm here as well, I can fight as well!" Flora said with conviction.

She was swinging the sword with the storing ability and attempting to use it as best as she could until she could no longer swing the sword for some reason.

When the dust cloud settled, they could see that Gorgath was holding onto the weapon.

Flora, seeing this, activated the weapon and made it explode on the spot, but it was doing nothing to Gorgath. From his side, a swing of another large sword which made the air turn into ice as it swung, was aimed towards his side.

Once again, though, when the sword got close to his body, the sparks emitted from it and hit the weapon away, as well as spinning Erin's body until she dropped to the floor.

"They… are losing to that celestial," Vanessa commented. "Should we help them, I mean, the celestials are our enemies, right?"

For now, Chris didn't order the move-in, and the answer was simple. It was because if they both fought against each other, they would weaken the other, and since both parties in front of them were their enemies, they could get rid of two birds with one stone simply by observing the battle for now.

"Still, aren't they outmatched," Lucas added. "I understand what you're trying to do, but that celestial looks like a strong one. Don't you think we should band together to defeat that, otherwise, we could all be in trouble?"

Chris folded his arms and stayed put for now.

"You don't have to worry about that. Zero is incredibly strong and has grown far stronger than the last time he showed me his prowess. All he has been doing is growing his strength.

"There is still a lot left in them, and for one, Zero hasn't even shown his ability yet. When he uses that and is still failing against the celestial, that is when I would agree with your suggestion."

On the battlefield, seeing how tough this fight was going, Zero started to activate the power from within and was ready to use the fourth stage of Qi.

'Not yet…not yet…' Zero thought.

*****

# Chapter 1948 Useless People




Stage 4 Qi. It was created to be used by those who didn't have a soul weapon—releasing the special inner energy in one's self in a certain way.

This was what it was known as. However, that wasn't completely accurate. In fact, the truth was, in the fourth stage of Qi could be used by anyone, at least anyone with good control of their Qi; it was just harder for those with an ability since the feeling of summoning a soul weapon and using one's Qi for the fourth stage were very similar.

It was the trump card from the high-ranking members of the pure and the talented ones. Even after 1000 years, this skill was incredibly powerful. And during that time, Pure had discovered something, and those that used the fourth stage did as well.

While using the fourth stage, it was very easy for those to go over the natural Qi energy stored in their body and start using their own life energy.

With this being the case, many members of Pure ended up dying as they used the fourth stage, making it less popular with newer members of Pure and was more used as a last resort.

'Does Zero really feel the situation is so desperate that he needs to use this right now?' Erin frowned.

The entirety of Zero's skin was now a dark red, looking similar to Gorgath. It was now strange to look at the two of them standing close to each other.

"Interesting, I can see now why Immortui had decided to make you into a dedicated follower. It's always hard for us celestials to find a strong dedicated follower that won't think about betraying us.

"Usually, such strong beings would never think about joining another, which begs the question, why did you?" Gorgath asked.

The second he had finished asking the question, he rode through the air and went straight past Zero, not caring for his new form at all, because in his head there was still one far more dangerous and annoying thing he needed to get rid off.

"Protect Agent Four! Do whatever you can to save him!" Zero shouted as he ran off after Gorgath at a speed that the latter had shown during the fight so far.

​ However, being equal in speed and with Gorgath in front meant he could never catch up. This put all pressure on the others.

Erin stood in front, and the cooldown on her skills had returned; the air around her was freezing up, forming frost on the ground, stabbing the large sword into the ground, the ice wall had been brought up again.

'I know this won't stop him completely, but it will at least be able to slow him down like before.' Erin thought.

Then she brought the sword up, ready to strike again. Erin was ready to time the strike perfectly but that was until the ice shattered in an instant as Gorgath's large horn pierced right through the ice.

'Look at the shock on your face.' Gorgath thought as he went straight past Erin, her sword strike missing and hitting nothing but the air. 'Before, I took down the wall just using my physical strength, but I can tell you haven't had much experience fighting celestial energy.

'Celestial energy can break through that wall with ease.'

Having struck nothing but the air, Erin was left standing in place.

'My strike, it was just like before, when fighting Laxmus, the strange power he used had managed to go against the wall…the skills of the demon tier sword are pretty much useless, but the Dhampir energy worked against Laxmus, so maybe it will work on him as well.'

Swirling around, Erin placed her Greatsword on her back while switching to her blood sword, and immediately it started to light up yellow with the familiar Dhampir energy she had. It was stronger than it was in the past but not as strong as when she had gone against Laxmus.

Either way, she threw out a strike, gathering up as much energy as she possibly could. It was a swift movement that allowed her attack to move faster than she could and head straight for Gorgath.

As the strike hit his body, it moved him slightly to the side, but his body once again hurled at the attack turning it into nothing.

'Damn it, it somewhat worked, but I need more energy, more Qi energy, more dhampir energy, just like in the fight with Laxmus. If the power in me can rise when fighting against vampires, doesn't that mean the power is always within me somewhere? I must be able to summon it somehow.'

Although her attack didn't do much to stop Gorgath, it had slowed him down by a fraction of a second, and once again, his fists had hit an invisible red wall that was now showing nothing but ripples of red energy. On the other side, Agent Four with his hand raised.

"I'm the one you should be focusing on!" Zero shouted as he suddenly appeared right by Goragth's side. With a strong strike, his large hand was hit away, and with the hilt of the sword, Zero unleashed a mass amount of power and hit Gorgath upward on his chin.

Slamming him with the butt of the sword, Gorgath's face was lifted for the first time in the fight, and before he could react again, Zero carried out a large slash right at his chest.

It sent him skidding across the ground, and the wound on his chest was deeper as blood started to spill.

"You annoying flies!" Gorgath shouted.

Another strike from behind had been dealt this time, hitting him right in his neck, from his eye, he could see that it was the blonde-haired woman. The only thing was, unlike Zero's strike, Erin's strike was unable to pierce Grogath's skin, and she was unable to move her blade because he had the tip of it held in his hand.

"You annoying bugs need to go away!" Gorgath yelled as the orbs spun on his left hand, and snapped the blade in half by pulling it down.

"No! The Blood blade! That belonged to…that belonged to." She was unable to finish her sentence.

As the blade broke, it allowed Erin to pull away, but one of her trusty blades, which she had held with her for years, was now useless.

"I see now, I was wrong about the order of things, I should get rid of the weakest flies first!" Gorgath launched himself from the position he was in and went straight for Erin.

Switching weapons would take too long, so she knew she could only do one thing. The armour on her body started to light up, and when Gorgath threw a fist towards her, it hit nothing but the air. His whole body had completely gone through where Erin was at that point and time.

However, although he was unable to hurt her, now having passed through her, he could see another right in front of him.

"I need to pay you back for the earlier attack as well!" Gorgath shouted as he corked back his fist again and threw it out.

Flora held the special sword in her hand, and in this situation, there was only one thing she could do. One of the abilities allowed the sword to change its form, turning it into something similar to a cape. It was one of the abilities of the thirteen vampire families, the one that boosted the greatest defence.

'I hope this works!' Flora screamed in her head as she braced herself. Behind the sword, she summoned all of the Qi possible that she could to protect herself.

As soon as she closed her eyes, she felt a powerful strike which shook every cell in her body as she was lifted in the air. The sword reverted back to its original form, and Flora was now flying back.

"That sword.. it didn't break. Just what is it made out of?" Gorgath thought.

Flying through the air, Flora finally hit the ground and skidded across it, the blow even with the second stage of Qi and the sword covering her, had hurt her internally. The impact was intense enough for her to spew out blood from her mouth.

She was too weak to stop herself as she continued to skid across the floor until out of nowhere someone came and caught her. Stopping her from going forward anymore.

She could feel someone holding onto her, and she raised her head, she saw who it was.

"Well, well, well…look which bitch ended up in my hands." Peter smiled.

# Chapter 1949 120,000




Zero was now successfully able to hit Gorgath, and right now, the two of them were clashing against each other nonstop. A large fist of power was thrown while Zero countered it by swinging his sword from the top—stopping it in its place.

However, out of the two, Zero was certainly more skillful. This allowed him to get a few hits in right after the attack. He would match strength with a throwing fist and then quickly try to deflect the attack so that he could get in a sword strike of his own.

When the sword struck against Gorgath's red body, it managed to pierce its skin causing quite a large wound on the body. Regardless, one could tell by the way Gorgath was reacting and still attacking at full strength that the attacks weren't doing much.

The sword had matched another strike from Gorgath, and as usual, Zero swung his sword. But this time, Gorgath pulled back instead of going in and avoided the blade, only getting the excess energy of the strike, which did nothing.

"What's wrong?" Gorgath asked, "I can tell that you're not as calm as you were when you first changed into this strange form. You've started to rush this fight for some reason. Does your current form have a time limit?"

Saying these words, Gorgath flew in with the red spark of energy and orbs swirling around his entire body straight toward Leo. Although Gorgath classified the others as weak, it was also clear they were strong enough and had enough tricks up their sleeves to defend themselves from attacks, so he wanted get rid of this one first.

Once again, Zero swung his sword, this time from above his head, with both hands holding the hilt tightly. One step forward and a large swing right down.

Though during the motion swing downward, two strange things occurred. First, the marking of the eye and two wings on Zero's head started to light up.

Second, in this strike, there was no longer just his Qi energy, but a white energy started to swirl around his sword like a snake as if it was alive, and this was the celestial energy of the immortal himself.

"120,000 soul strike!" Zero shouted, as the bladed part of his sword also lit up in bright pink, condensing the energy of other Qi he had taken.

Unlike before, this strike didn't just have 100,000 souls but even more of those that Zero had absorbed.

Lifting both his arms above his head and tilting his head forward—so the longhorn could be used as well—Gorgath attempted to block the attack.

As the sword hit the horn, it went halfway through before stopping, and an immense amount of energy exploded right where he was. The black ground substance was a lot harder than that on earth.

It needed to be to survive the countless number of demon-tier beasts on the planet that would constantly fight. Yet, the attack had slammed Gorgath's levitating feet into the ground and caused a huge crater around 10 meters deep to appear.

Zero looked down into the crater because where he stood, it was more as if he was standing on top of a hill now.

"Zero from the Pure faction—no, leader of the Pure faction," Aj said as he zoomed in, "I guess his power never should be underestimated, after all, he was the leader of Pure for a reason."

Chris clenched his fist watching the fight, imagining if he was Gorgath and what he would do in the fight against Zero because there was a good chance that he could be in his place in a near future.

Jumping back, Zero was now by Agent 4's side.

"That won't be enough to kill someone like that. I can tell that they are not out for the count. Which is why I need you to do something."

Zero explained, "Get out of here and find the meeting point. We will deal with this; you know what must be done."

Agent 4 nodded, not saying anything else, he pulled up his little device, which showed the map of the area, and then began to run, run out of the fighting area.

"You!" Zero shouted, referring to Erin, who had mostly been standing there, unable to help much, "I can finish this fight, but I'm going to need your help."

Zero placed his sword back in his sheath, and oddly, Erin could feel immediately that there was a large amount of Qi energy building up inside.

"With my soul strike, I am able to gather more energy quickly while it's in its sheath. It is clear that 120,000 souls of Qi are not enough for someone of this caliber."

The ground started to shake underneath their feet violently. Breaking out of the hole, floating up in the air, there he was: Gorgath.

"ARGHH!" Gorgath screamed and grabbed the top of his injured horn that was on his head. He started to pull at it, his muscles building until eventually a large snap was heard and half of the horn had been broken off.

Blood was pouring from the top and raining down, but the wound soon healed up.

,m "I need you to buy me some time, and I promise I will finish him off!" Zero claimed.

Gulping, Erin thought that this might be the request. So far she had been able to do next to nothing, but while standing around she was trying to summon the energy that was from within, yet it hadn't worked out so far.

However, she wasn't a fool to know that without Zero, they wouldn't be able to defeat the celestial. He was doing most, if not all, of the work. So if she didn't help now, it was possibly the end for them.

"Fine, but whatever attack you are cooking up, make sure it doesn't miss." Erin pulled out her great sword and held it in both hands as she looked up. Her skills weren't horrible by any means, it was just the one in front of her was a tougher opponent than she could have imagined.

Before this fight, she never realized how much she relied on the natural rise in dhampir energy one would get when fighting against vampires. In truth though, she never thought she would have to ever fight against strong enemies that weren't vampires in the first place either.

For Gorgath seeing Erin wasn't a problem, because it was his original target in the first place.

"Don't worry, I can't miss," Zero smirked.

That was it, now Chris knew that Zero was ready to use his ability.

——

Although it hadn't been long, Agent 4 was running as fast as he could through the land while following the map he had. He had a strong grasp of Qi, so he wasn't slow, just slow when you compare him to the other monsters that were around.

With the map in one hand, Agent 4 then started to tap away at his stomach. It made a hollow plastic sound as if his body wasn't made of flesh, and that was because it wasn't.

After a few presses here and there on his fleshy-like belly, it had moved to the side. Like an open metal panel, and inside there was a storage area.

Reaching in, Agent 4 pulled out a bright red crystal, and not just any crystal but the Red Heart.

'It was because of the Red Heart, I was able to use the armor and crown's capabilities to their fullest without having to worry. This thing in my hands is truly a really amazing thing.' Agent 4 smiled as he thought.

Looking up, where a large black mountain could be seen in sight.

"That's the point, the location that Zero gave me. We have finally figured out how to use the crystal and its powers.

"According to Zero, his master has told us to open up the portal at this point. Where the energies of the two worlds are closer."

"Even if Zero is unable to beat that thing, his master certainly will be able to," Agent 4 smiled.
