# Chapter 1670: Chained Heart
Rather than a mere handshake, Jake opened and greeted Shiro with a large bear hug, earning him a few pats on the back from the latter. The strongest human sure wasn't shy about showing that he was close with the Blade family. The reporters were commenting on this because they knew it was strange.

For one, the Green family were working closely with the Chained. There were talk shows that had clips for days of the two groups fighting together against beasts. It was to show the Chained's strength, to get more people to feel safer with the Greens compared to those of Pure.

However, there was one thing that was clear, and that was the relationship between the Chained and the Blade family. Which is why they thought that Jake wouldn't have acted like this so publicly.

"You know you shouldn't be doing this," Shiro commented, but couldn't help but have a smile on his face.

"Who cares what people think? You've known me since I was nothing but a small brat. The only one who I would have to listen to is my old man."

There was a scoff following Jake's declaration, so he quickly corrected himself.

"Next to my beautiful mother, of course!"

When pulling away, Jake noticed something, and it wasn't just the eyes of all the reporters, it was the slight heat that was coming off from Shiro's body.

"Did something happen?"

"Nothing I couldn't handle, and definitely not anything that needs to be talked about here." Shiro replied, getting ready to sit down.

"Don't look at me like that, if it had proven to be too much for little ol' me, then he would have helped out."

Jake didn't look too confident about Shiro's words, even after the other had given him a wink, but decided to leave it for now. He understood that this was neither the time nor place to talk about those things.

Unknown to the two of them, the whole world was currently talking about the Blade family. This was because many people had seen the strange attack that had occurred from AJ's life stream.

There were people on both side arguing their case. One side claimed that this had merely been the action of an individual, therefore it shouldn't represent the Chained as a whole.

On the other hand, the others at least blamed Clicker for failing to teleport the guy away, or at least the Blades to safety. More radical ones went as far as to accuse the Chained directly, with this being just a test.

"Hey guys, I would appreciate it if you stopped talking about that, because I'm scared for my life right now." AJ thought to himself, still nervous inside. He was battling with his own feelings.

As a reporter he was naturally excited that everyone was talking about his captured footage, but for the first time since seemingly forever he truly felt in danger. The fact that Clicker had included him in the teleportation meant they had already known he was there.

This was different to filming battles that had already started between Pure and the Vampire Corps, or filming factions fighting against beats. AJ had possibly nor only caught, but also released something that the Chained would surely not like having been made public, especially on this particular day, making him into an actual target.

He was just hoping that now that the last VIP guests having arrived, this event would move on quickly.

"No more risky moves... I'm glad that I didn't release that footage of Jessica crying. Maybe if worse comes to worst I can use it to bargain my way out or something." AJ thought.

"Everyone, will you please finish what you are eating, and give a large round of applause for the person who was able to make this all possible, the one and only Russ Chain!" Clicker shouted.

Clicking his fingers, at the very end of the rose aisle, the man himself appeared. Surprisingly, the groom wasn't wearing his beast armour. Instead, he had come out with no shirt on, only trousers, showing off his lean body as he walked.

Now with his top off, the large tattoo with black chains was completely visible. It was going across his back and chest, crossing over where his heart was, which also had a tattoo of its own, being locked up by several chains.

Clicker continued to click his fingers, summoning the elite team of the Chained, making them appear by the only empty table. Everyone clapped as they saw Russ out of respect, and soon he walked down the aisle on his own, all the way to the giant arch.

It certainly wasn't like a conventional wedding, though honestly no one had expected it would be. When Russ eventually got onto the stage, he turned around and looked at his guests.

Without the need to say anything, the crowd went silent, intrigued by what he would say next. But first, he shifted his head to the Blades, especially Shiro.

"Honestly, it was hard for me to imagine such a day would ever come, but now look at us. Our group has been able to establish itself to the point where we're able to meet eye to eye, on the same level as these figures here."

"However, I want everyone present to know that it wasn't easy for our group. No, for us, it was one of the hardest things to accomplish."

"I wish to share our journey with all of you today, so that you might be able to understand the Chained a bit more, and continue to grow with us."

"I was born in complete darkness as a slave." Russ let a moment of silence pass to instil what he had just revealed.

"I don't know much about my mother, apart from the tales my friends and what I came to call my family had told me, but I do know one thing for sure... and that is how she died."

"You see, a long time ago, many of those you see here today, a member of their family line had been captured by the Blades for one simple reason: they desired their power. My mother was also among them."

"The Blades named those like my mother the Chained, because that is what we were to them. Nothing but cattle that got chained up to prevent us from using our powers to escape, to be used whenever they desired."

"It's impossible to tell whether they didn't know about my mother's pregnancy or they simply didn't care. They left her in a dark cellar, where she had to live off of the scraps of food."

"Despite some others sharing parts of their own meals with her, my birth had left her too exhausted, leading to her death."

"Now, would the Blade family let a little child go? No, they kept me chained up, just like my mother, in the hopes that I might have inherited her powers, or perhaps develop something else entirely for them to use."

A lot of people were shocked to hear this, they knew of what the Blade had done, it had come out before, but they didn't know specifically of Russ's circumstance, and it looked like he was revealing it all today to everyone.

"However, there was some light and that was all the other Chained that had been in the same position as me. They were the ones who taught me how to speak, how to survive, and in return, I wanted to create a place for them where they and their family lines could live."

"At first, we weren't accepted, and it has taken a very long time, but now we are able to take a step forward circumstance, and it looked like he was revealing it all today to everyone."

"Everyday we are taking a step forward and something that started out as a dream is becoming reality. To have a public wedding that the whole world is watching is truly an amazing thing."

"I thank you all for accepting my invitation, and I thank you all for being witnesses of this truly historical moments." Russ stated, bowing down to the rest of his group. The Chained couldn't help but stand up and start clapping with all the strength they had in their hands.

"I have to say, he is a good speaker and can get the public on his side. Working with him was the right thing." Fizzwell mused. "I'm glad he's not an enemy."

Hearing this, Jake and Shiro looked at each other, but since Logan wasn't here, they clapped away, joining the other guests. In the middle of the applause, suddenly Clicker was made aware of something as a person approached him and whispered in his ear.

"What did you say? I don't care! Just get rid of the problem! The wedding is about to start, we can't have any more distractions!" Clicker replied.

Of course, AJ had been paying attention to Clicker this whole time due to his fears, and it allowed him to notice this, while everyone else was focused on Russ. Seeing this, he also could see off in the distance that a ship was approaching them.

Looking and filming the complete thing, it wouldn't be long until the others would notice, but before that could even happen. A large energy beam was used, hitting the ship. It created a large explosion and a bang, turning the heads of all the others.

They could see a large dust cloud, but no ship, and so everyone was confused about the meaning of this.

"Everyone, please don't worry!" Clicker shouted. "We were just testing something. Let's sit down and continue on with the big day."

It was strange to see the explosion, but it wasn't too large to be anything significant, the others realised. After all, it was a small ship, the explosion was just bigger than the ship, yet AJ had managed to spot something.

Quickly pulling up a tablet linked to his cameras, he went through the footage an rewound it, slowing it down, and he definitely had caught something.

"Just before the ship was hit... it looks sleek, some people jumped off, but then they suddenly disappeared... into a shadow?"

*****

# Chapter 1671: I know you
The sound of clapping and cheering reached her room, only making her feel even more nervous. Jessica could hear her pounding heart, which was a very unusual feeling for a vampire.

"What is going on outside for everyone to cheer so much, and how long will I have to just wait here?" She thought as she stared at the guards standing still around her. Especially, at the leader of this group, a female guard named Momo.

"This dress is quite heavy, and it's uncomfortable around my waist... and time is moving so slowly."

While waiting in the room, it was then that they suddenly heard an explosion. It didn't sound too bad from inside the establishment, though, since the spaceship was quite far off. At first, Jessica didn't think much of it, but a few seconds later, it looked like Momo, and her group had received some order as they looked at each other and nodded.

"Someone came in to try and break me out of this wedding, have they?" Jessica commented sarcastically, knowing no one was coming for her.

"Do you know anything?" Momo asked.

It was clear this was a serious question, and now, Jessica knew something was going on.

"Of course not! Who would even come for me? I mean, you should know I was just a normal member of the Vampire Corps, and my family aren't even important people." Jessica said, shaking her hands.

Her plea didn't do much, though, as Momo ordered one of the others to go and hold her. Immediately, the guard stepped forward and grabbed her two arms from behind.

"Should I fight back? I mean, I should have more natural strength than these guys as a vampire." Jessica thought, but in the end, she decided to let them do whatever it was they were trying to do. Just then, a short man, wearing a strange set of goggles, walked toward her.

The goggles were extremely thick, making him look like he had a pair of bug eyes... And upon reaching, the man took off his glasses, and that's when Jessica noticed that his eyes were entirely black, as if all he had was a pupil.

"I heard you vampires use something called an influence skill, but it's a shame with the increase of use of Qi that you vampires have been able to do next to nothing. We humans have continued to evolve while the vampires have stagnated and haven't increased their strength since the beginning."

Jessica wondered what this guy was trying to say and had a real urge to punch the person in front of her in the eyes, but she knew she wouldn't be able to get out, so she just gritted her teeth.

"Tell me, is there anyone that is coming for you?" The weird eyed man asked.

It was at that moment that Jessica knew what his ability was. It was something that could surpass the protection of Qi, something that was stronger than an influence skill. It was an ability that forced its victim to reveal the truth.

"No... no one's coming for me" Words came out of her mouth against her will, and tears almost streamed down her face upon realising the truth.

"Are the Vampire Corps planning something?"

"No!" Jessica shouted again. "They abandoned me to you guys! They're the ones that brought me here!"

"What about the Blade family? Are you working with them!" the man asked again.

"NOOO!" Jessica screamed, and she had enough.

Being forced to answer these questions truthfully had unlocked something inside Jessica. She realised that she had no one, and in the end, why was she then keeping her secret from these people? Why was she trying to do anything for them when no one would come for her?

Screaming at the top of her lungs, Jessica summoned the power from within. Her right eye started to glow yellow, which had somewhat shocked the strange bug man.

She had gathered her Dhampir power as she usually did when she got into challenging situations. Her secret was now revealed to the Chained, and what they would do with this information was up to them. However, that was not important right now.

The inside of her chest started to glow, and it was then, sprouting out from the back of her body, a hard wrapped red string. So hard that it looked like tentacles were wrapping out from her body, and their edges were sharpened with her red aura, turning them into flexible blades.

Immediately, two of the string tentacles stabbed into the arms, holding her and then coiled around the arms, tightening their grip on the attacker's forearm.

Screaming at the top of her lungs, Jessica used all her strength to lift the man and slammed him right on top of the strange bug-eyed man, causing the two to crash.

"Are you crazy!" Momo shouted. "Do you really think you could take on us, and even if you can defeat us, did you forget where you are?"

Ignoring what the person in front of her was saying, Jessica used the rest of her string as a shield, spun it around her, and ensured no one got close. She was determined to get out of her no matter what.

Like a spinning top, her string blades could spin non-stop, and now all she needed to do was run out of the place, but that was when something strange happened.

Momo began walking towards her, and just when she was just inches away from being attacked by the strings, she disappeared from her spot, and in the next instant, she had already grabbed Jessica and slammed her face onto the ground.

There was intense heat that slightly burned Jessica's face, coming from the gauntlet that Momo now had in her hands.

"Don't damage Russ's wife's face!" A guard shouted.

Hearing this, Momo quickly let go, and by the time Jessica got up from the ground to attack her again, Momo had returned to her previous spot.

"What was that? How did she manage to get close to me? That makes no sense. Does she have teleportation powers like Clicker? But, the Chained don't usually share powers like that. It must be something else."

The number of abilities in the Chained created a significant disadvantage when fighting against them. Still, since the Chained didn't want to hurt or kill her, she could use that as an advantage.

Using her soul weapon again, she was ready to get out as she wished until one of the men lifted his hands, and something strange happened to her string. She was no longer in control!

Her solid like string tentacles had wrapped around her own body and created even more strong wrapping around her stomach until she was completely tied up.

"Did you really think we are just random guards from the Chained?" Momo stated. "We could have killed you in a few seconds, but we aren't allowed to, which is why you were even able to put up that little show, but I guess one interesting thing came out of it."

The group started to laugh as they walked up to Jessica on the ground.

"You are really an idiot, and you aren't strong enough to do anything."

Just then, from under the door, a shadow entered the room and went to where Jessica was. It was quick, and the guards didn't even have a moment to react. Then, rising from it, was a lone figure wearing the sharp silver blue fang set.

[Nitro Accelerate]

The guards only saw the figure for a second, but with a single hit here and there, they were sent flying out of the room, slammed into the ground, and made so they could no longer move. Knowing something was wrong, Momo used her time stop ability to see what was happening.

That's when she could see there was an intruder. It was less than a second, and he had already taken four of her people out.

"Who is this person... I... I can't use my power for long. I will have to take him out right now!" Momo was stunned.

Her ability would stop as soon as she made the slightest contact with a person. So, when she attacked him, she thought it was enough, but as soon as time resumed, the intruder lashed her hand away and grabbed her by her throat.

"Although she isn't strong enough to do anything herself, it's a good thing she knows someone who is," Quinn, the intruder, thought.

*****

# Chapter 1672: Party Crash
When Quinn held Momo tightly by her neck, the latter knew that her life was in this stranger's hands, but she couldn't quite tell what had occurred. For the first time ever, her ability turned out to be useless. Due to Quinn's hand coming in contact with her, she could not use her ability anymore, and her powers were now futile.

"I... I have to inform the others somehow." Momo thought, but the grip around her neck became tighter to the point where she had trouble breathing, and eventually, she passed out.

Then, Quinn did something strange to all of the guards who had now passed out. Shadow began to wrap them, and while covering them like blankets, it continued to flicker over their body.

[Shadow cover]

This was one of the new shadow skills that Quinn had obtained a long time ago but hadn't found a practical use for it, until this moment. Since the Shadow could slow down attacks and the perception of time, shadow cover was something related to it.

It was able to somewhat stick on the part of the opponent's body, and in doing so, it would slow down certain powers such as healing. It was a skill that Quinn imagined would have been helpful in his early days, but in his current fights, it was best to use his Shadow in other ways.

However, Shadow Cover meant that those he had just knocked out rather than killed would stay unconscious for a long time until he decided to recoil the Shadow.

He was confident that there would be no disturbances for the next few minutes. Quinn loosened his grip around Momo's neck, and as she fell to the floor, he turned around.

Jesica couldn't wait to see who her saviour was, or perhaps it might even be an enemy. Whatever the case, she was satisfied for at least this moment. She felt a little free, even if she knew that it was still impossible to escape this place.

"I'm sorry, I was so focused on myself that I didn't realise that you had your own troubles," Quinn said as he looked at her.

That was when Jessica raised her own eyebrow.

"Who... are you?" Jessica didn't recognise this person at all. It was clear the other party was a vampire, but she couldn't identify who this person was. "Is he someone from the Vampire Corps?"

"I almost forgot, Jessica has only ever seen me with the earth mask on; she has no clue who I am."

"Maybe this will help." Quinn raised his hand, and out from the Shadow, a few people stepped out. Minny, Hannah, Peter and finally Lucia as well. As soon as she noticed who was in front of her, Lucia ran and gave Jessica a big tight hug.

"What... what is all this. I'm so confused?" Jessica couldn't understand what was happening and what these people were doing here.

"It's us. The person who just saved you was Nate, and this is Peter. And you have seen Minny and me. It's a long story, but we all came to get you."

"We heard from Andy that you were being married off to the Chained's leader and that's why we are here." Lucia explained.

Jessica stared at the people for a few seconds before realising that Peter and Nate looked different compared to what she remembered. Still, she also knew that the two always seemed suspicious, as if they were hiding their identity. Either way, even if they were showing their true self, she couldn't have recognised them.

Seeing the people who she had just met taking such a big risk and coming here, she couldn't help but get emotional as a stream of tears flowed from the corner of her eyes and onto her white wedding gown.

It was a sweet moment, but it didn't last long as Jessica soon wiped the tears away as she came back to her senses.

"You all... all of you have to leave! This is the Chained we are talking about."

"I know you all came here for me, but the last thing I want is for you guys to get killed just because I didn't want to marry one annoying guy!"

"We know," Hannah said. "Trust me, we have told these two countless times who the Chained are and how strong they are, but they still have decided to come for you."

There was still a terrified countenance on Jessica's face, and she was trying to find the words to speak to them, to make them go back.

She didn't understand why they would come for her, perhaps if she did understand, she could convince them to go away, but it was then that Quinn walked up to her.

"I know you're concerned, but we will try to talk to them. I also know you're doing this for others, but it's not right."

"The world I fought for was not one where people had to sacrifice themselves for stupid things like this. I will talk to them." Quinn spoke.

"And if talking doesn't work, and I have a strong feeling it won't, we can always go with my plan," Peter said while punching a fist into the palm of his hand, making it clear what the other plan was.

"I... I..."

"Auntie is back," Minny said, smiling.

Jessica realised she couldn't win. This group had already made up their mind.

Knowing this, a smile appeared on her face.

"Thank y-"

Suddenly, Jessica disappeared from the room. She hadn't finished her sentence, and she was gone, but it wasn't just her. The guards who were passed out on the floor were disappearing one by one as well.

"It has to be Clicker!" Mitchell said, "He is teleporting them out of here..."

*** *** ***

At that moment, Jessica's name as the bride to be was announced. Everyone in the hall turned to one end of the aisle and saw her ruined make-up from the crying and her messed up gown covered in blood.

Countless gasps escaped from the crowd for the next few seconds as they wondered what was going on.

To understand the situation better, Clicker, of course, used his powers on the guards and instantly brought them to the hall. But when they appeared, their bodies were seen just lying there on the floor. The guards were unconscious, with many having their bones broken and were heavily injured.

Aj zoomed in on Jessica's face.

"I knew that she wasn't happy with this wedding. Did she try to escape? But I was unaware that she had so much power to defeat many of the Chained Guards."

Realising what had happened to herself and her friends not being around her, she knew she could be in danger. She could see Russ standing there bewildered while staring back at her. It was the first time she had seen such an expression on his, and for some reason, this gave her immense courage.

Grabbing her dress, tilting her head back and taking a deep breath, she readied herself.

"Russ!" Jessica shouted at the top of her lungs. "I refuse to get married to you! I want to live my own life!"

There was pin-drop silence in the hall. From the Chained to the reporters, no one dared to say anything.

"She just refused publicly... What is going on... What's giving her the courage?" Aj thought. "The state of the Vampire Corps, the Chained... and now the public knows that the bride to be is unwilling. Although I guess many of them knew that this was a political marriage in the first place."

"Jessica, what has happened? Did someone attack you? Has someone tricked you?" Clicker was the first one to speak. "If you are in trouble or don't feel safe, you can speak to us. You have always been free to do as you wish."

Clicker was doing a good job trying to calm down the situation, and with how Jessica was right now, it did seem like something must have happened that they were unaware of.

"This could get a bit messy, but she has no choice. She won't even be able to get out of here even if she fights back." Shiro commented.

Some of the other Chained had quietly stepped forward while Jessica, on the hand, gulped. But just as she took a step back, Jessica felt her back hit something solid.

"It's okay." A familiar voice entered her ears, "I said I will talk to them."

Pushing her behind him, Quinn walked forward.

And instantly, everyone's eyes and the cameras were upon him.

He was now the centre of the world's attention once again.

But this didn't phase him any bit. And without hesitation, he said, "I am here to talk with the Chained to call off this wedding."

*****

# Chapter 1673: Peter's Plan!
After seeing the bodies of the Chained disappear, Mitchell quickly caught onto what was happening. After all, being part of the Vampire Corps, he was aware of the Chained abilities and doings.

Quickly, he had explained to Quinn what was happening, although they didn't quite know how Clicker's ability worked. It seemed he could only teleport those that he had marked in some way before.

"The wedding, it could be happening any minute right now. You have to go!" Lucia shouted. "We have to get there quickly."

Hearing these words, and with the Nitro accelerate still having a few seconds left, that was precisely what Quinn had done. He ran off towards where he could hear the most noise.

The Chained establishment was mostly empty, and on their way there, it was hard to miss where the crowd was exactly, and that's how Quin could get to Jessica after only being at the isle for a few seconds.

"Who is this guy?" the reporters asked loudly.

For one, they wondered who would have snuck into the Chained base. Then there was the question of who would be willing to as well. Someone who could do two of these things, the reporters, thought they would have at least had or heard of this person.

As the reporters looked at each other and talked with one another, none of them could come up with an answer.

"Jessica, things could get very dangerous here, so just stay close to me, okay," Quinn said as he carefully placed his hand behind her.

Instinctively she latched onto Quinn's arm at this moment. She didn't know why, but she felt somewhat safe with him close to her. However, what this had done was made it clear that Jessica knew this person.

"Is it some sort of secret love rival going on here?" The reporters asked but still had no idea. "Someone finds out who this person is!"

"Do any of you know this person?" Fizzwell asked. He was a little annoyed as he attempted to get through to Andy Regardless of his attempts, he was unable to get through, as the Chained seemed to have some way to block all forms of communication while they were there.

If this wedding didn't go through, Fizzwell was worried that the vampire corps would take the brunt of the problems from them.

"I have no idea, but it would make a great drama series, Jake replied. "It's a shame he didn't come in just as they were about to kiss. With a... "I object!" that would have been a bit cool... or maybe too cheesy."

When Jake had fought against Quinn, he had done so with the disguise, so to him and Vicky he was just another person.

"Why... does he feel familiar? Do I recognise him from somewhere?" The others heard Shiro mumble of all people, but they thought he might just be saying things with his old age.

The truth was, Quinn wanted to use his shadow space to place Jessica inside, but he was worried that taking her away like that might cause everyone to act. It was clear that all of the members of the Chained were already on their toes getting ready to pounce at any second.

"Ray" Quinn called out. "Tell me I'm not the only one that can feel it... I know you're in the shadow space, but you can tell, right?"

There was another reason why Quinn was being a little cautious. He could feel something from before, but now here, he was sure of it.

"Yes... I can feel it. The energy's the same as hers." Ray replied, with a sour taste in his mouth, and refusing to say her name.

The energy Quinn could feel now wasn't just the energy of a celestial; he could tell that it was a celestial themselves. Whether the celestial was working with the Chained or perhaps just here for fun, Quinn didn't know, and it was quite possible that they would just be doing things of their own accord.

"I am here to talk," Quinn shouted once again but noticed something was off but wasn't quite sure what it was.

"You heard that Jessica does not wish to go through this wedding. I understand that this is important to you, so I thought that maybe I would be able to give you something in return to call this wedding off."

There were few things Quinn had in mind, perhaps maybe even his Demon tier gauntlet, or he could even hunt some beasts for them. Even an I.O.U from the Hero Quinn should be enough.

"The others can't hear you or me," Russ said from the other side. "It's the ability of one of my men. You have caused quite the commotion, and we wouldn't want you saying anything to frighten them, now would we?

"I'm afraid that a stranger wouldn't have anything of interest to give to me, and even if you did offer something, why wouldn't I be able to just take it from you?" Russ asked.

To this, Quinn smiled; he thought it might be the only way to get out of this situation.

"Because of who I am. My name is Quinn Talen. I assure you, I should have or could do one or two things that would allow you to stop this wedding."

There was a pause from Russ for a second. He didn't outright laugh like others did when Quinn revealed himself. Instead, it looked like he was thinking.

While the silence was taking place, everyone else was on their toes. They were unable to hear the exchange going on but could see their lips moving. Obviously, it was an ability from one of the many Chained.

Aj found this interesting, a way to silence anyone that wanted to speak up or maybe could reveal a big secret of theirs.

It was then that Russ finally said something, but when he moved his mouth, Quinn was unable to hear him this time. At that moment, a single person came out from the crowd and stood down the aisle in front of Quinn.

The man started to run forward towards Quinn, and his skin started to change slightly, turning a little grey. It was hard to tell what his ability would be, but nonetheless, he was a Chained and everyone knew they were strong.

"It looks like we got a bit of entertainment for ourselves; maybe this was even all planned." Chris said with a smile, eager to get some fighting done himself.

Before reaching Quinn, the man threw out a fist, and a strange rod-like structure came out from the end of his knuckles. Seeing this, Quinn quickly hit the large rod away to the side and took a step in.

He grabbed the man by the shoulders and kneed him in the stomach. The second it hit, blood came out from the man's mouth.

The impact was loud, and a large cracking sound could be heard. Everyone who was close could feel the energy that had come from the attack. It even shook the hairs of a few standing close.

"I held back. It's not the time to kill him."

The man was somewhat resilient as he attempted to throw another quick fist ignoring the pain he was going through. But avoiding it, Quinn pushed the man forward before throwing out a high kick and breaking the man's thigh, dropping him to the ground.

Once again, there was silence, as the stranger had dealt with the Chained member rather quickly.

"That was skilful, really skilful. To take out a member of the Chained like that." Aj thought, happy that he managed to catch everything. Either this is some show the Chained are putting on... or this is going to be one of the craziest events in history.

The other reporters felt the same way as their hearts beated even faster.

"Was that meant to be a little test to prove to you who I am?" Quinn asked, still silenced by the strange ability. "I held back, I don't want to kill your people, but I assure you I can prove I am who I say I am."

Quinn was unsure how it would go, thinking that things could turn at any moment. The man in front of him was strange, and even after seeing Quinn's powers, he was unafraid. It was as if, even if he knew the real Quinn was in front of him, he wouldn't be scared.

Which was unsettling to Quinn.

"His mouth is moving again, and I can't hear what he's saying... and now... I can't hear what the others are saying as well."

Clicker was walking up to the table where Jake and the others sat.

"As you can see, the intruder wishes to stop this wedding. Our leader, Russ, has called on you all to help in stopping him. As a sign of the friendship the Chained hold with you all."

The others looked at each other. Many on the table were enemies. They thought that maybe this was a sign that the Chained weren't on anyone's side.

"This will be easy work," Flora said as she stood up and drew her thin blade. The dhampir was ready to take action immediately. She had been holding herself for a long time at the table next to other vampires.

"All of you, feel free to stop him!" Clicker shouted to the rest of the Chained, who were also eager to help.

"Nate!" Jessica shouted. "What do we do!"

The members of the Chained hadn't quite attacked them yet, but they drew their weapons. It looked like they were waiting for the others to act. Quinn, seeing who was at the table, wasn't quite sure he wanted to be fighting all of those at once, especially since some were possibly allies.

"It looks like we go with Peter's plan, and I have a good way of solving this." Lifting his hand. Something dark appeared above Quinn's head.

Seeing this, those that were about to move on the table froze. This was the shadow ability. The shadow was a power that only a few knew, and the size of this shadow was fighting itself, but soon they were left in awe as they could see a significant figure falling from the shadow itself.

Slowly descending, with its enormous tail swinging and its two giant wings, they could hear its breath. Finally landing directly behind Quinn, its large, heavy body shook the ground as all four of its feet hit the floor.

It let out an almighty roar swinging its neck and opening its large mouth. The roar shook the ears and hearts of all of the people there.

"Ray... it's time to be useful."

# Chapter 1674: Mighty Two!
With the sheer power coming from the beast's roar, everyone who was present could tell what this was; without a doubt, it was a demon tier beast. They had fought many beasts countless times, making it possible for them to tell that this wasn't just a demon tier beast, but an extremely powerful one.

It was unique because it looked like a dragon, but not only that, because at present, the beast was doing something strange. At the moment, there was a single head, but suddenly from its shoulder sprouted another one, another head.

It was just as great in size as the other and caused even more fear as its large eyes looked to the left and right of the people beside it. Honestly, Quinn didn't even know what was happening but noticed that sometimes when entering the shadow, that Ray had either two heads or one.

He thought that maybe it might have something to do with the real dragon's consciousness that Ray had taken over, or perhaps Ray just prefered having one head rather than two.

Since the dragon had been summoned, it was almost as if everyone had somewhat forgotten about the shadow power used to summon it and who had done such a thing.

"That Dragon... it can't be it has two heads... and a dragon demon tier beast. I haven't heard of one since back then." Shiro thought, his hand tightening around the back of his chair. He had yet to move and so had everyone else, somewhat stunned by the roar.

"Do you recognise it at all?" Shiro asked, but these words weren't spoken out loud; they were spoken in his mind.

"Back then, the dragon only had one head. It was never whole, so we never saw what it completely looked like... it has some similarities, but it has been a long time."

"The question is, what is it doing here if it is here?"

This was something that Shiro wanted to know as well, and seeing that the said person in front of him was using shadow powers and this uncertain similarity, there was one person that kept coming to mind.

"But... that's impossible... right?"

Shiro was mixed about this whole event in the first place, so honestly, he thought he might be just using this as an excuse not to take part in the first place.

"What are you all doing? Take down that Demon tier beast before it takes us all out!" Clicker shouted.

Hearing this, it looked like the fifty or so members of the Chained had now sprung into action. Abilities started to fire off towards the dragon, while others ran forward. Quinn was about to use his blood powers to help, but there was a voice in his head before he could.

"No need, I'm surprised you decided to use me in a situation like this, but I'm kinda happy!" Ray replied, speaking directly into Quinn's mind like he usually would.

"I can't believe these idiots think they can actually take me on. Even if I'm not in a body of my own. They are using powers that were originally meant for me."

Immediately, Ray placed a large wing covering Quinn and Jessica up. Most of the abilities hit the large wing, doing next to nothing. The dragon's scales were one of the strongest, and it would need powers beyond what the Chained had, even with the extra Qi boost.

After knowing this, a large flap of the wing sent out a large gust of wind, and the wing's span grew slightly in size as it was let out, knocking several of the chains flying through the air.

The reporters still believed that they were somewhat safe until this point, but after seeing this, and knowing that not even the members of the Chained could protect them, they knew it was their time to get out of the area.

Many started running away from the wedding; some stopped filming completely as they cared for their lives, while some were determined to get the scoop they had been waiting for.

Even Aj, had gone somewhat further away from the fighting but summoned some of his tiny drones to continue filming the whole event, while others did the same.

"Our mysterious stranger just summoned a beast of some kind, and it looks like the Chained powers can do nothing! Is this a member of the Bree family that has been turned, or is it someone else?" Aj spoke as he continued to film.

Letting out a large breath from both of his heads, two wind vortexes of great strength and pressure had been created from the dragon, blowing onto both sides. The Chained rolled up their defences to try to block it. Some were able to withstand it, while others were blown away and cut up.

The attack was more devastating than a user of a wind ability.

It was then that a blonde-haired young man was seen in the air flying above. The cameras turned and could see that it was Jake Green.

At the moment he was using the ability of flight, he swept down as fast as he could, and in doing so, he created a giant fist out of earth, that was getting bigger by the second. Using the speed ability with his flight, he could fly incredibly fast, and a huge impact was made, hitting directly the top of the dragon's head.

It looked like the dragon staggered for a second as it moved its foot, but Ray pushed off and used its second head to grab onto Jake. At that moment, Jake used the hardening ability to cover himself.

"Don't kill him!" Quinn asked.

Biting softly onto Jake, Ray swung his head and threw Jake off to the side.

"It looks like they might need all of our help, after all, to take on that thing," Chris said, after seeing Jake's attempt in attacking the beast fail.

"What's the plan!" Jessica asked, still frozen about what this vampire had just done.

"Talking hasn't worked, so we will get out of here," Quinn replied, and just as he was about to grab Jessica, he saw her disappear in front of his eyes.

Turning his head, he had some idea of where she was, and now Quinn could see Clicker had summoned Jessica to Russ side. On top of that, they weren't alone. The Chained A team they would travel with Russ, was present having gone back a bit further from where the aisle was onto the wasteland.

Aj turned his camera, focusing on Russ rather than the dragon, like the others were doing so far. Panning his camera, it seemed like this person had a lot to go through. There were the allies of the Chained that had arrived, Jake, Vicky, the Blade family, Pure and more.

"Go get her." Ray said. "I'll clear a path."

The active ability on Quinn's armour had ended, but he was still plenty fast. As he ran forward, the allies attempted to attack him, but each time they did, the Dragon was clearly seen firing out powerful gusts of wind from its mouth, aiming to hit the others.

Then, there was a flame ball instead when it came to the dhampir girl who was about to directly get in Quinn's way.

"I can kill that one, right?" Ray asked.

None of the allies got hurt, but they couldn't get close to Quinn. The dragon was seemingly ignoring the other Chained attacking it, to allow Quinn to get through, and at the same time, some of the allies weren't exactly focusing on Quinn.

"It looks like we might have to work together to get rid of this dragon first before we go after him." Fizzwell stated.

To somewhat clarify that, Ray then jumped up over everyone and landed just before where Quinn had gone, blocking the path for any of the Chained or the allies. Ray was happy to take on the rest.

Now on the Dragon's other side, Quinn could see Russ, Jessica, and his main group of people.

"You have done far more damage than I could have ever imagined," Russ spoke. "I had no idea that the Hero Quinn would act like this, and there was no talk that he was able to do things like this either."

"Some legends are over-exaggerated." Quinn replied. "But not all."

Russ smiled at the comment.

"Even if that is true, it will be impossible for you to take us all on yourself, even for someone like you."

Once again, Quinn could hear the confidence in Russ's words, even after summoning the Demon tier beast; why was this person unafraid. Perhaps, it had something to do with the celestial being in that group of his, Quinn thought.

"Maybe, things need to just be a little more even." A voice said as one group had emerged past the Dragon. "This is a little fairer now, right?" Peter spoke while the others stood by his side.

*****

# Chapter 1675: The Return of an enemy!
All eyes of the Chained and the allies were on the Dragon in front of them. If they wanted to help their leader in any way, they had to get through this demon tier beast. However, after seeing a few attacks, including it chucking Jake Green off to the side, they weren't so confident in their attacks.

"This is in a way testing the Unity of the Chained." Aj thought.

"Unlike other groups, the Chained are banded together as individual strengths with a common goal and background, and although they respect their leader, they wouldn't risk their lives to protect each other or their leader."

What was surprising for the audience who were watching through the reporter's channels was that the Chained powers and attacks did nothing to stop this thing.

"I don't understand, isn't that a demon tier beast. The Chained have taken out demon tier beasts before. They even have demon tier equipment."

"Well, to be fair. The main group of the Chained aren't even fighting."

"Yes, but this is meant to be such a powerful group that all of these groups are fighting for them to get on their side. Yet they can't even take out one Demon tier beast?"

"If that's the case, then Earth and all the other planets would be doomed if there was another strong demon tier beast attack. Or a horde of them or something."

"You seem to forget that those very same allies fighting for the Chained's acknowledgement are also struggling against this Demon tier best."

It was precisely as the comments started because the ones on the move were Jake, who was recovering from being flung off into the distance. His mother, Vicky who was making a more laid back approach as she seemed to be using more of her powers to protect members of the Chained.

Then, Fizzwell, the vampire crops leader, Chris from Pure and the Dhampir Flora.

Giving out a big huff and placing his sunglasses away, Fizzwell locked up at the Dragon.

"Andy isn't going to be happy if I didn't;t act, so I guess I should do something."

Holding out his hand, string started to come out from his fingertips and attempted to wrap around the dragon's leg, but as it got close, Fizzwell could see his strings being cut.

"Well… What is this, some type of wind barrier or something? Does this dragon have some type of wind ability, but it also fired out a fireball earlier as well. Maybe a dragon with all the elements, or just two because of the two heads."

"Either way, I'm pretty useless without my strings in a situation like this."

Fizwell shrugged his shoulders as if he really didn't care.

"Why am I not surprised."

A female voice was heard and the next second, Flora could be seen running right past him. Her hand was still holding the hilt of her sword, ready to unleash it from its scabbard as she got closer to the Dragon.

Seeing this, Ray focused one of the heads toward the allies that were against him. While the other head was busy attacking the members of the Chained that were willing to try and take down this beast.

There weren't many and simple air attacks seemed to be working well enough.

These members seemed to be acting more so as a test for themselves or to prove how strong they were.

Multiple shots of air that were near enough invisible had been cast from his mouth.

They moved at a speed that most would be unable to avoid, but Flora was able to jump at just the right time. Explosions would be seen hitting the ground creating large craters beneath it.

"Wow, she's the only one that has been able to get that close to the dragon apart from Jake." A reporter commented.

"Perhaps we are seeing the fighting strength of the dhampirs. How is she even able to avoid those invisible strikes?"

Hearing this comment, Fizzwell was a little concerned. With all the reporters, seeing the dhampir using her power might cause trouble for them. Honestly, this just wasn't the right match up for Fizzwell, and showing everything he had on camera he didn't think was a good idea either.

"Those reporters that know nothing about combat really annoy me. There are other ways to tell if an attack is coming your way other than just your eyes." Fizzwell thought.

"The position of the mouth forms the dragon, the sound it makes when it cuts through the wind. Do they really think that none of us could have done that… there are just more problems to worry about."

Finally, Flora having reached a good distance where she could prepare her attack, she started to draw her weapon. The next second though, and she could hear something else coming from her right side.

The sound of the wind being cut through, but it wasn't like the sounds she had heard previously. Turning, she had only managed to draw her weapon halfway out from its scabbard, and she had no choice but to fuse her aura energy to make it somewhat defensive. She spread out her Qi as well.

An object as large as a pillar had slammed right into her, dragging her across the ground. As she made contact, she could feel the same defensive wind barrier constantly trying to attack her.

Her body was being cut up by the second, and her natural Qi was being dwindled down by the attack.

"It's the dragon's tail!" Flora released.

"If I put that much Qi, into stopping this attack, then my body is going to get destroyed from this strange wind defence this beast has!"

In the middle of contemplating what to do, that's when she felt the force of the tail stop. Looking to her side, she could see a shirtless man who was scared all over his body with red hair holding onto the Dragon's tail.

"It looks like you might need a little help." Chris smiled, as he held the tail with one hand, and gathered his strength up, the outside of his hand could be seen glowing as so much of the second stage Qi was being used.

The fist was thrown into the tail, and a loud bang was heard as if a bomb went off. The tail was seen swinging back out in the direction it had come from, nearly hitting some of the others.

Still, the tail was under control, and Ray turned to look at the man who had managed to damage one of his scales. A few seconds later though, the scales by his tail that looked injured had started to heal as well.

"There are some strong ones here, and although this dragon is not as strong as I was in the past. It has been boosted in power with my own a little. Making it stronger than the Demon tier beast it was in the past."

"What's annoying though, is that Quinn told me not to kill many of them, and that's caused a lot of trouble for me."

It was then that Ray could feel another attack coming from his right side, and lifting up his large wing he defended the thunderbolt. Jake was back in action, and all of the allies realising that they couldn't beat the dragon alone, now knew that they needed to work together in some way.

"I thought that I would enjoy fighting as a dragon again." A voice was being projected into all of their heads, and at the same time, the Dragon appeared to be shrinking in front of their very eyes.

"However, it seems like I have somewhat become more accustomed to fighting in a different form. I think this will be easier for now."

Once again, everyone on the field had paused, they didn't know what to do, and the reporters were somewhat shaking. This was due to what Ray had done.

He was now a little bigger than a regular human. No longer did he have two heads and he had made his body look like that of a human. However, in doing so, using the body of the dragon, the dragon that had created them.

To the people, he looked like an ancient enemy that hadn't been seen for a very long time. Ray had the appearance of a Dalki. Only covered in larger scales and had a more menacing look in its eyes looking more dragon than a man.

"Let's try this again." Ray smiled.

A lightning bolt came out from above, where Jake was currently. It was green in colour this time, having been mixed in with another ability. Ray stood there planning to show them all that this would do no harm.

He was somewhat thinking that the others might give up if they saw they were no match, but something had even surprised him. A person had come to his side, showing no intention of harm, quickly held two hands up, two blue coloured thunderbolts of his own appeared and had hit the green one.

Seeing this, Jake pulled back on his attack, trying to weaken it as much as possible. When the two thunder strikes collided, there was an outburst of power in the sky, causing a faint glow to appear on the others' faces.

Now looking at who had stood and blocked the attack for the dragon, Jake was raising an eyebrow.

"Uncle Shiro! What are you doing!"

*****

# Chapter 1676: Strange powers
"Ladies and gentlemen, you guys are seeing exactly what I am seeing and although we can not confirm for sure, it looks like we have a Dalki."

"The race that has been seemingly extinct for the last eight hundred years!" Aj reported to his viewers.

Immediately, the online audience began pulling up the reference photos and pictures of the Dalki from the internet, and made comparisons with what they were witnessing on the screen. Although the figure didn't fully match the pictures, there certainly was a resemblance in the appearances of the two.

"If history that we have learnt is correct, the Dalki's strength was determined by the number of spikes on their back. Our great hero Quinn had defeated the strongest Dalki in existence and that Dalki was known to be an eight spike." Aj continued to report, and that's when he knew he needed to confirm something.

Because there were people between Aj and the supposed Dalki, it was hard to get a clear picture of the latter. Without hesitation, Aj used his ability and ran from one side, went around all the destroyed wedding decorations and the ongoing fight, and reached the other side.

He came to a halt, and although there were others around him, it looked like he could only see one thing: the Dalki.

On its back, just below the shoulder level, there was a single spike looking somewhat similar to a shark fin. Then, there were two smaller spikes on either side, totalling the number of spikes to three.

Then following the beast's spine, one could count four more spikes going up to its tail bone. This alone would have meant they were looking at a seven spike Dalki, but the spikes didn't stop there as they continued along the tail until the very tip.

This was something never seen before.

"Eleven spikes?" Aj mumbled. He didn't have to say it out loud, as his viewers had counted along with him.

"He thinks I'm an eleven spike Dalki?" Ray could hear the reporter even from a great distance and smirked inwardly at these words. He and the Dalki were two completely different things.

The Dalki had pretty much become its own separate race when mixing the beast's DNA with humans. In fact, the Dalki, upon reaching a certain level, could even beat the Dragon, and Ray knew the Dragon's strength well.

Graham, with eight spikes, was certainly stronger than the Dragon even if the latter was fully combined with its two parts; although the power gap wouldn't be much, it still would exist. So for him, the species meant nothing. It was merely his form, but the whole world thought differently as they looked at him.

"Anyway, I'm more surprised at something else. Why did this black-haired man come and protect me from the rest?"

"What are you doing, Uncle!" Jake asked aloud as he landed by his mother's side. All the allies had spread out and were staring varyingly at the Dragon figure.

Most of the members of the Chained had already been dealt with or at least felt the power of the Dragon to know that they were useless even if they attempted to join the fight, and thus, they just stood far back along with the other reporters.

Shiro glanced behind him for a second. He wasn't looking at Ray though. He was looking past him, towards someone else.

"What do I say... is there any way to stop the fighting at all." Shiro thought.

"You will have to give a good answer," Chris said aloud. "We know the Blades and Chained aren't on good terms. But if you choose to side with the enemy and a Dalki no less, we will have to fight."

Hearing this, Jake glanced at his mother. There was no chance that he or Vicky would fight against Shiro.

But if they didn't solve this immediately, the united battle against this Dragon could turn into a fight between each other.

"The person...the person behind me..." Shiro hesitated for a moment and then, with the most serious expression he could pull off, he glanced at the mother-son duo and said, "Listen to me, Vicky! That person, look at him and remember, that's Peter... I am hundred percent sure that's Peter!"

Shiro was unable to see Peter before, he hadn't even noticed Peter and the others go past the dragon, but when Ray had shrunk in size, he could finally see the others behind, engaged in some sort of battle.

That's when everything had clicked for Shiro. If Peter was here, after a thousand years, then the reason why he felt like the other person was so familiar, the shadow powers and this dragon right here, what because the other person had to be 'him'! Although, his appearance wasn't what Shiro had vividly in his mind.

After all, it had been a long time, a very, very long time, but there was always an image of 'him' in Shiro's mind. It was from a moment in Shiro's life that he would never forget, no matter how many years passed.

"The person who is attacking... he is my teacher," Shiro answered.

*** *** ***

Before Ray had transformed into his Dalki-like state, Peter and the others had arrived by Quinn's side. Honestly, he wasn't sure if he was happy or not that they were here. These people in front of him were pretty dangerous.

"In the past, the system would give me quests and rewards for facing tough situations, but since becoming a celestial, it's only given me long-winded quests, and I guess stuff to do with celestials. Which doesn't really make the current situation easier." Quinn thought.

"Still, it's a good thing I have Ray to keep the others busy, including Jake Green and Chris."

"They are a handful and half, and Chris has a Qi amount I have never seen before, but I need to focus on those in front of me."

"Are you sure you don't want to talk it out?" Quinn shouted out to the other side.

The people in front of him were gearing up for battle.

"I'll let you in on a little secret," Russ replied.

"If I can have everything I want, then why would I not just do that? In the end, things will always work out for me."

Hearing this, the first thing Quinn did was raise his hand and use the shadow lock skill on Jessica. She instantly disappeared, swept into the dark shadows. He wanted to keep her safe, and now he had what they wanted.

However, Clicker clicked his fingers in the next moment, and Jessica reappeared right beside Russ. It was the first time Quinn's shadow lock hadn't worked.

"We not have you do that again." Clicker said, clicking his fingers again, making Jessica disappear.

"It looks like you will have to force us if you want to see her again."

Annoyed, Quinn ran forward towards the group. He used his full speed. His armor set had already changed to something else since the blue fang set had cooled down, but 200 plus speed was definitely no laughing matter.

It allowed him to cross the large land between them in seconds. Yet, even with all of this, the whole group didn't look worried at all.

"We have to support Quinn." Peter said as he ran forward, having a bad feeling about this all.

As for Quinn, looking at them all, he decided that it would be best for him to go for the most troublesome one in the whole group.

There were plenty to pick on, and as he approached the group and headed for Russ in the centre, he quickly changed his direction at the last moment.

Clicker prepared himself, but Quinn ran straight past him and instead went for the dark-skinned female who was seemingly the most ordinary in the group.

Quinn's hand reached out towards her, but just as it looked like he was about to grab her, the armour she had around her legs began to light up, and it suddenly released steam, blocking Quinn's view.

He clawed his hand anyway, thinking he would be able to grab hold of her, but his hand only caught air. And when the steam settled, she was already out of reach, leaving a trail of steam behind.

Twice in a row, Quinn had been bested. First, his shadow lock skill was countered, and now his speed couldn't match up to one of the members of the Chained.

"I could tell from the inspect skill that they were demon tier boots and would most likely be speed based... but I didn't think they would be this powerful."

"Still, I have other ways to deal with her, and there's something that can surely slow her down." Quinn thought, thinking of his shadow.

While Quinn had attacked the female, the Chained were shocked by his move because they were not expecting Quinn to target the female from the get go.

"How did you know?" Russ suddenly asked, "It wasn't a coincidence that you went for her!" He felt challenged by Quinn's actions, "It looks like you're full of surprises, but so are we."

It was then that Quinn tried to use his shadow to expand on the ground and envelope the area to slow down his enemies, but when he attempted to use it, nothing happened. The shadow did not appear from under his feet.

"What is going on here...? I can't use my ability!"

*****

# Chapter 1677: Double up
With everyone somewhat surprised that a member of the Blade family had come to aid the Dalki looking figure's side, it allowed Ray a few moments to glance behind him, trying to figure out the situation. And whether his descendant would need some help.

"The Celestial Energy that I can feel... he will be okay, right? He is a Celestial, and is strong himself. I have seen him fight, but why is the energy familiar?"

"It's not that damned woman... but the person the energy is radiating from... I don't recognise them."

A thousand years seemed like an incredibly long time for Quinn, yet the time when Ray had been active on Earth made it look small in comparison. Recognising faces wasn't exactly something that he could do well. However, feeling the power of energy was somewhat similar to smelling or tasting something.

Part of your brain would remember the familiarity, which would make you try to recall the related memory.

Either way, whatever came up for the young one, Ray was sure he wouldn't need his help, so he could instead focus on what was in front of him.

Since the group had been standing around for awhile, Flora had decided to make a move against the Dragon once more.

She had already recovered from before, and took a step forward, but as she did, something akin to an electric whip headed straight at her.

Just when it looked like it was about to touch the top of her head, a large hand reached out and grabbed onto the blue electrified whip. Sparks continued to go off, around the arm, as if little shocks of lighting were trying to bite it.

"I thought we had an agreement... shall I take your actions as a sign that you wish to renege on it?" Chris asked, eventually letting go of the electric like whip as he could feel its power fading.

Putting his ability away, Jake was being a little more cautious than he would compared to before.

"He held onto that with his bare hands... is he really accomplishing such a feat purely with Qi?"

"I've never met anyone that can do that sort of thing, and it doesn't look like that hurt him at all. I guess Pure hasn't just been sitting back and doing nothing." Jake thought.

"He's a family member, you have to understand that. I'm sure he has his reasons for doing what he is doing. At least, hear him out!" Jake argued, before turning around.

"What do you mean by teacher, Shiro? How could a vampire be your teacher? That makes no sense!"

Shiro then looked towards Vicky, and closed his eyes for a second.

"It might be better for someone else to answer that question."

After saying these words and opening his eyes again, Shiro is entire presence changed.

"Vicky." 'Shiro' called out, the fluctuations in his voice were different compared to what it was before.

"It's him... he's returned. We knew he would come back one day..and he's finally returned."

*** *** ***

Quinn had tried to summon any part of his shadow and he even quickly checked to see if the system was all in order, including his MC cells.

Nothing seemed to be wrong, but as he tried to activate his powers, he felt nothing in his body. It was as if he never had the powers to begin with.

"Oh what's wrong?" Russ asked, a grin on his face.

"It looks like you are having a little trouble with something. I have met with one of you Guardians before, and your shadow powers are certainly troublesome."

"Unfortunately, he managed to escape before I could finish him off... but I won't be making this mistake with you!"

Hearing the word Guardian, made Quinn think of the Red Vampires again, and it looked as if Russ was mistaking him for part of their group.

Lifting his head up and looking towards him, Quinn had a sad smile on his face, as he let out a sigh.

"Haaah... so you think I'm part of the Red Vampires?... I guess, I can't blame you for mistaking me for one of their fanatics claiming to be Quinn Talen. Well, it doesn't matter if you believe me or not, I don't need to rely on the shadow powers or beast weapons to deal with the likes of you."

Russ had taken a step back, and the others did the same.

They hadn't acted yet, worried that this person might very well have a trick up his sleeve. It was then that a large amount of aura started to emit from Quinn's body.

His eyes glowed red, and the aura wasn't just covering a single part of his body, it had erupted as if it were flames from his body. At the same time, something else was occurring. The blood from the victims that Ray had fought was moving.

It had floated in the air, like raindrops and was coming towards Quinn mixing in with his aura. The aura continued to glow until it was as if there was against flame behind his body.

"What is this... are you sure he's one of theGuardians and not the Red Vampire leader himself, Russ?" Clicker asked, worry in his tone.

"No... he doesn't look anything like that guy..." Russ replied, getting slightly nervous at Quinn's display of power.

"I... not unless he replaced him."

"Perhaps this is all my own fault. Ever since I woke up, I tried keeping a low profile, not wanting to disturb anyone since it was no longer my time."

As Quinn spoke, more and more blood gathering around him.

"Unfortunately, even after all those years that I have been gone, nobody wants to just talk things out."

"Kindness still appears to be something that isn't given freely, but something that has to be earned by force... fine then, let me speak the only language guys like you seem to understand!"

The aura that surrounded Quinn was condensing into a darker red. Usually the aura from vampires was quite light, and they had never seen something like this before.

Suddenly, throwing out his hands, the blood aura from his body had split, and with it in the air behind him, they started to form into the shape of swords.

Soon, the aura had created a thousand BloodSwords floating about in the air. This was something that not even vampire leaders should be capable of, and the crowd's eyes were starting to linger on the scene behind the human dragon.

"My body has really changed. I can't feel the strain when even using this much blood power like I could before. I haven't used the Celestial Energy yet, but let's get rid of all the annoying bugs around here."

"Me and you are the same, so let's just make this a battle between us." Quinn said, as he continued to look at the dark skinned lady.

"Clicker!" Russ shouted, as he understood what the intruder meant.

As soon as his boss called out his name, Clicker lifted both his hands and clicked with both of his fingers.

Quinn was ready to move the Blood Swords, yet stopped since his target was nowhere to be seen.

To his left and right, none of his friends were there, behind him there was no wedding scene, nor guests filming videos. However, there was one person who was in front of him and that was Russ who was still present.

"You... might have convinced me a little, that you might be the Hero..." Russ stated solemnly, his voice containing some faint hints of reverence.

"No one, not even the Red Vampires could have as much blood control as what you have demonstrated. You said to make this just a battle between us, no? Then let's battle."

Although Quinn had no idea where he was, that wasn't an issue for him. He could always travel back to the others by using Minny's shadow.

Of course, for that to happen, his shadow would first have to start working again, but since only Russ was currently in front of him, it wasn't hard to guess the reason for his powers abandoning him.

"Fine." Quinn answered and was ready to throw out the thousand Blood Swords towards his opponent.

Moving his hands quickly though... quicker than humanly possible, to the point that only someone as quick as Quinn would be able to follow, a strange aura surrounded the Chained leader, a red strong aura.

The aura left his body, and started to form objects in the air. And with that, suddenly Russ wasn't the only one faced with a thousand Blood Swords...

# Chapter 1678: The special one
Most of the group were unable to keep up with Quinn, with the exception of Peter somewhat, and they all knew that, but they had decided to follow him anyway. Even though Quinn was leaps and bounds ahead of him in strength, Peter knew that at times there could be trickery involved, especially with all this celestial talk Quinn had told him about.

Still, when seeing him dash ahead into the group of Chained, Peter knew that he was able to deal with it. Even when Quinn had missed, he wasn't worried and seeing him summon his blood aura; it looked like Quinn had control of the situation.

After all, Quinn was only using the appropriate power needed to crush these fools. In fact, Peter believed when summoning the 1000 blood swords, he was perhaps using too much power.

A human wouldn't use its whole strength to squash a few ants after all, but things had quickly changed because the next second, Quinn had disappeared suddenly, and it wasn't just him but Russ, the leader of the Chained as well.

"Where did Quinn go!" Lucia said.

"Was it Clicker's ability, but how... how was he able to teleport him to another place without even having touched him before."

As the group had discussed earlier, Clicker's power allowed him to transport people and objects.

They knew this but it seemed like there was some type of condition involved, and as for that condition it was unknown.

"We don't have to worry about him," Peter stated.

"Wherever he is, I'm sure he will deal with whoever gets in his way. This is the person that has taken on Graham, Hilston, and more than you people know."

Hearing Peter's words, Lock, a man with large bushy eyebrows that were pointed upwards towards his large forehead, couldn't help but laugh.

"The person who defeated Graham... I admit those blood powers are strong but don't try us corner with this lie, right guys?"

When asking the question, he looked at the others, that all seemed to agree, but there were two people that were a little startled, one of them was Fizzle.

Her boots were still active. Usually, she would only use her boots when needed and deactivate them, but even now, she had turned her head a couple of times, thinking that maybe the vampire in question would be after her again.

As for the other one who was in shock, it was Clicker himself.

"What's wrong? You can't possibly think our leader will lose to that guy?" Lock asked.

"Wait..." Cube, a square-headed man said, who had several coloured rings on all of his fingers.

"How was Clicker able to transport that vampire? Did you know him?"

Clicker shook his head.

"I... I haven't met him before... but... the fact that he was successfully teleported means... He's telling the truth."

"Screw you guys!" A loud voice said, and Peter was already in the middle of throwing a punch directly towards Lock. It was unexpected from the group since they believed they were quite a safe distance away from the other group, especially with Clicker moving them a little further away, after moving Russ first.

Snapping out of his troubles, Clicker used his ability to move Lock out of the way and away from the punch, causing Peter's fist to hit nothing but air, but as it followed through, a loud bang, as well as a cloud of smoke.

Peter hadn't held back with his punch, and the others could visibly see it.

"Damn...none of these guys are normal." Lock complained. "He's fast and strong as well."

"If you guys have the chance to talk, then tell us where Jessica is so we can have a nice present for Quinn when he comes back!" Peter shouted, running forward once again, but even as he started moving, Clicker just transported the whole group to a different area, moving once again.

Peter had to readjust his position, attempting to run towards them again, but this time, Clicker had split them all up slightly, leaving Peter confused about who exactly to go for. Eventually, he had chosen one, but after running towards the said person, Clicker just moved them again.

"Damn it, I hate to say it, but you guys can help a little. There's five of them and four of us, so maybe distract them a little, or get rid of that annoying guy!" Peter shouted.

"Hey, there's five of us as well!" Minny said, staying on top of Lucia's shoulder. It was then that Lucia quickly thrust her spear forward, and out from the tip a blue lightning bolt had left, heading straight for Clicker.

It wasn't a random attack either. It was timed perfectly to when Peter was about to run towards one of the other members of the Chained. The one great thing about the Graylash family's ability was the speed of the attack itself. Seen as it was incredibly fast, now Clicker had a choice, move one of his allies or take the hit himself.

It was then that Clicker decided to click his fingers once more, and while doing this, he bashed both of his hands together. At that moment, the armour he was wearing over his arms had formed a strange round shield.

The lightning bolt hit the shield directly, and it was a mighty blow, causing Clicker's feet to move slightly. The attack looked like it would soon bypass the shield completely and hit Clicker himself, but before it did, he used his own ability to get away from the lightning bolt.

"Damn it, how many times can he use that ability. Does it not use any Mc cells or what?!" Lucia shouted as she once again aimed towards where Clicker was.

If there was one thing she was sure about, it was the fact that he couldn't keep teleporting all of them forever. There had to be a limit.

Peter had unlimited stamina, and she had only just started using her powers, and as long as Clicker didn't have an incredibly large MC pool, he would soon be unable to use his powers. However, as she thrust her spear forward again, this time, nothing came out.

"My... my ability, what's happened? I can't use it! I can't use any of my lighting powers!"

The square-headed man with the rings on his fingers started to laugh at this. Cube just looked at her, smirking away.

"It has to be that guy... does he have the power to stop abilities? Is that what happened to Quinn before?"

Of course, it was fine for the rest of the group if they didn't have their powers. They could still use their red aura, and Lucia could still use her Qi as well, but she relied on her ability more than the others, which meant she was no more than useless and perhaps would soon become a sitting duck.

"You're not wrong. You are our target." Clicker said, looking at her. Clicking his fingers, soon Lock had appeared directly behind her, and in doing so, he had pressed his hand on her, and the next second she felt an immense weight all over her.

Trying to use her Qi, she powered her muscles to stand and swung her spear behind her, but it was slow, and the weight that she could feel in the area was being magnified. She fell to the ground lying flat on her front.

The ground was crushed along with her body as the strange force was felt, pushing down.

"The power of gravity... it's so strong..far more immense than I imagined."

"It's time to finish you." Lock said, getting ready to throw a kick, but a red beam came out midway, sharp and fast going right through his leg. Lock shouted out in pain. He always had a level of Qi surrounding his body, so the attack had to be strong.

As for who the attack had come from, it was a little girl standing a short distance away from Lucia.

"I want to protect my family as well," Minny said with her hand in the shape of a gun and her finger looking partly destroyed already.

Seeing this, Fizzle started to act. She ran forward using her boots, heading towards them to get rid of the girl, but then getting in her way was a similar red beam coming from a different direction. She stopped short, allowing the attack to miss her and looked to where it had come from.

"You were the one he went for," Mitchell said.

"Although you have done nothing but have your hands empty this entire time, you were the one that Quinn went for. There has to be a reason for that."

# Chapter 1679: The return of a legend!
A lot of attention from the reporters was where the most people were present. That of course was not too far from the wrecked and destroyed wedding equipment. Most of the reporters were hiding behind the wreckage as they continued to film the scene in front of them, that of the strange Dalki against the allies.

Not much had happened for a while now, as it looked like the groups were discussing something, but thanks to everyone having enhanced microphones, they were able to pick up on the conversation between the two sides. However, there was one that noticed something going on behind the Dragon that had been summoned.

"Everyone will be filming this fight, and the others are too scared to go ahead, but that's where that strange shadow user went, and it looks like something else is going on."

Quickly, moving from one pile of debris to the next, AJ was making his way over so he could get in a better position. He was planning to make another scoop by filming what the others were too afraid of.

Of course, he had to be careful not to catch the attention of the Chained. Going around the whole area, AJ finally found some of the ground which had been uprooted, making it look like a large rock.

It had been from the shipwreck that had happened the other day. It looked like they didn't quite bother to repair any of the grounds that weren't going to be used for the wedding.

"It looks like I've hit a jackpot. That's the Chained's A team that's fighting against the intruders." When checking how many viewers AJ had at the moment, the number had gone significantly down due to him being on the move.

The ones who had stayed were the hardcore fans of his that believed that he would show him something phenomenal. Since it was nearly impossible to watch multiple streams at once, the others had left to other channels who were covering the main event, leaving him with only a few thousand.

"Although I might not have a lot of viewers now, once this is all over they will all start flocking to the other things that happened during this event."

While taking a peek, AJ noticed that there were two people missing from the main event.

"Where is the Chained leader... and where is the intruder." There were goosebumps on his body. Wondering what was currently happening.

At the moment, there were three major events occurring, yet it appeared as if the world would have to miss out on seeing one of them.

*** *** ***

"So, what are we going to do?" Ray asked, making sure to use a mental connection to address only those who had been fighting on his side.

He had long since noticed the reporters and could guess that their strange machines were aimed at them to listen in.

"I am happy to wait here, so you guys don't get involved with what is happening behind me. They need practice after all and if they don't survive, that's just how things were meant to be. The cycle of life." Ray rambled on.

"I'm afraid the situation has changed a little." Fizzwell said, walking forward.

"Now that we know that there is a powerful Dalki still alive, this has become a worldwide matter. It would be best if we could get rid of the problem here and now, but if the Blades insist on supporting him, I guess there is something in history that we don't know about."

Hearing this, Jake looked towards his mother. His uncle Shiro clearly said something to her that had stunned her. He had never seen her this shocked. Whatever was to happen, though, he would follow her.

Suddenly, one person decided to act, the current leader of the Bree family that had also attended the wedding, had charged out from where the Chained were.

She was riding on the back of the flaming lion. As the beast opened its mouth, it shot out a large flame ball that was in the shape of a ring. It was heading straight for the two Blades.

Shiro looked like he was ready to block the attack, but lifting his hand, he could see eight lines of large yellow aura coming towards him. Seeing this, he had no choice but to harden his body, the attack was too quick to do anything else, which meant that the flame was still going to head towards Ray.

"You guys really don't have to do this for me." Ray thought and spoke to those that were seemingly on his side, because he could see one more person heading in front of him.

That was Vicky herself, she lifted her hand, and blasted out a ring of water to crash into the flames of fire. As the two closed, large amounts of steam filled the whole area, blocking the view of everyone.

"Uncle Shiro!" A voice was heard, and throwing out his two whips of lighting that were in his hands, Jake had slashed all the yellow aura attacks from the Dhampir before it reached his uncle.

"If mother has decided to help you, then I will help you as well."

"Thanks," the man replied as he placed his hand on Jake's shoulder. "But it's not Shiro right now."

Vicky, having blocked the attack, could see the steam clearing up, and she then looked towards the other Blade.

"If you want to go help your friends out, then we will do whatever it takes to stop them, it's been a long time."

Hearing these words, there was a genuine soft smile on the man's face.

"I keep telling you guys, there is no need to help them." Ray let out a sigh, and now that the steam had finally heated up, everyone could clearly see the VIPS having split into two sides.

"Is it really going to be like this, with the Green's there now I really don't know what to do, and I can't get through to Andy." Fizwell facepalmed, shaking his head.

The Bree family leader, a Vampire Corps General, Pure's Agent 1 Chris and the Dhampir Flora were all on one side facing off against the Dragon/Dalki Ray, and the others were on the other side.

"You're right." Shiro replied. "Somehow Peter has looked after him this long, so they should be okay. Since Quinn summoned you, I will protect you, whoever you are."

"You protect me, that is a funny statement to make." Ray couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of that statement.

"However, you seem to know the young boy. So what is your name?"

Hardening his body until it was in a complete solid state of metal, he turned around to look at the others.

"The name is Vorden... but let's talk more later. For now, let's subdue those pesky flies and wait for Quinn to return."

Now with how the situation had turned, even Flora who had been aggressive in her attacks wasn't sure if it was the best option. It wasn't just anybody that they would be going against. These people were strong, and they were already having trouble when it was all of them against the Dragon.

"Pure will be happy to show that they care for the people." Chris announced loudly.

"We will go against the Dalki. If they have returned, then it is our duty to fight them off. Pure will always protect the human race from whatever dares to threaten their existence, be it Dalki or Vampires."

Chris hadn't done much so far, but with a single hit, he had proven to be the most effective against the Dragon. Stating that he would be joining, it had already dropped in the Dhampir, and it looked like those from the Bree family had made up their mind as well.

"I really don't know what to do." Fizzwell uttered, as he twisted his foot in the ground.

"Why does it have to be my decision to make?"

Looking up, Fizzwell could feel a breeze on his face, and all he could see was a dark fist in front of him. On impact, he immediately felt his nose getting broken and his whole body flipping, until the punch forced his body to go downward into the ground.

The Vampire General slammed into the ground, chucking up countless piles of rock and debris.

"Don't worry, I made the decision for you. I was never going to just let you guys go. Not after getting the chance to fight for a long time, anyway."
