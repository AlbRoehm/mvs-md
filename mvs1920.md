# Chapter 1920 White Skin

p Despite all of the MC cells that Sil had, even with them combined with his strongest abilities, nothing seemed to be able to harm the thick white skin of the celestial. It was the first time for Sil, even when he was fighting against other celestials, that his skills couldn't do something.

However, despite this, perhaps he was being too cautious in the fight, because it took Borden to act, before Sil began to realize that he was nowhere near done. He hadn't even touched the tip of the iceberg in comparison to what he could do.

The first thing Sil did was clone himself, twelve different times to be exact. As he did, each one of them opened up a portal and pulled out demon tier level weapons. Swords, spears, shields, and of course Sil himself was also using his favorite demon tier weapon, the trusty trident.

'If I can't hurt him with abilities and such, I can always just use weapons and my natural strength.' Sil thought.

At that moment, Kipo could be seen falling back down from the sky. Borden, no longer standing by the side, had decided to jump up in the air to meet him halfway. Borden threw out a large fist of his, and Kipo had done the same.

When they both collided, there was a clear winner in power as Borden had been sent back down crashing into the moon and skidding across the land, breaking up all of the ground. The next moment, Kipo was in front of Borden, reaching out and attempting to grab him by the neck.

With blood oozing out of Borden, internally he was growing stronger and whacked the celestial's arm out of the way, punching him in the stomach twice. They were large powerful blows, mountain shattering punches that were being dealt to Kipo.

Taking the hits well though, Kipo planted his feet, and grabbed onto Borden's shoulders. With his finger tips, he dug them into his hard scales, piercing through them and causing them to begin oozing blood, and began pushing him down.

HIs legs suddenly broke through part of the ground, and only half of Borden's body could be seen.

"You stay here nice and still, while I break you." Kipo stated, letting go, and spreading both of his hands as if he was ready to perform a massive clap, right there and then, moving his two hands together they came right towards Borden's head.

Using all his strength, Borden was pulling himself out of the ground. It was working, but of course it might be a little too late.

As the hands came close, out from the side, a large hammer struck down at one, hitting Kipo on the forearm and putting it down, while at the same time on the other side, a spear had been whacked from above doing the same.

Both of Kipo's arms had been hit, and not only that, there was Sil himself who was ready with his trident. Thrusting it forward with his strength and gathering the power of the water around it that swirled around, he shoved it forward, hitting Kipo's skin.

As the time it touched, it was unable to pierce the surface of Kipo's hard skin, but the strength of the attack still hit him away, sending him a good ten meters across the ground before he stopped.

"What is this, clones? But… they are all as strong as you." Swinging his arm around before moving forward, Kipo had hit one of the clones in the head, one of those that was behind him and prepared to strike him with a demon tier sword.

As it hit the Sil clone, it stumbled for a bit, and during that stumble, Kipo picked up the Sil clone and slammed him into the ground. The black markings on Kipo started to swirl and move on his body as if they were alive.

At that moment, all of the clone Sil's had gone in for an attack, aiming to try and knock Kipo off the Sil he was about to deal with. Using all their strength and power, some using the power of speed, others using the power of strength, they thrusted and swung their weapons towards him and all of them had landed.

Yet, not a single weapon, even with the power of it being a demon tier, and the power of Sil's abilities, none were able to pierce the skin, or knock Kipo from this place. He continued to slam his foot down and it had gone right through the Sil clone, turning it into a cloud of smoke.

Although the Sil's that were created were just as strong, ability wise as the real Sil, the endurance was not the same, A strong hit was able to defeat a clone and this was what Sil was somewhat afraid of.

His MC cells, at the level they were, allowed him to create 1000s of clones, and with the abilities he had, usually there wasn't a single person in the world that could stand up to that. The thing was, if none of his abilities were to work against the celestial in front of him, what was he meant to do?

Another one of the Sil's had thrust a spear forward. Once again Kipo had done nothing, no leaning, no trying to avoid the strike whatsoever, and allowed for the spear to hit his chest. The spear had used its active skill opening up like a claw, and now five points had attempted to pierce the celestial but that hadn't worked at all.

It was then that Kipo went ahead and grabbed onto the spear. Relentless attacks from the others were being used on him from behind but they were doing nothing.

'What is this, before when Sil had thrusted the spear, it was able to do something but why isn't it working now?' Vorden thought. 'Is the celestial's resistance actually getting stronger, as the fight is going on, if that is really the case then… is it possible to win this fight?'

With such strength, Kipo had pulled the demon tier spear out from Sil's hand, and quickly turned it around so it was now in his. Thrusting it forward, all five points had pierced the Sil's body making it turn into smoke now.

"I can tell that you are incredibly strong, if you were to go up against any of the other celestials that had been sent out, you would have won against them relatively easily. I believe only one might have given you trouble, nevertheless you are one of the strongest God Slayers out there."

With the spear again, Kipo went to attack another Sil, but a super sped up Sil had dived in with the demon tier shield stopping the attack. As soon as it did, the shield looked to have a mouth on it and began to consume the spear on the spot, breaking it down.

Letting go, and jumping back, Kipo was slightly worried that something might happen next and this gave Sil the perfect chance to attack.

Gathering all of his power, Sil had thrown out the trident and while it was in the air it began to multiply, if there was one thing about Kipo, he didn't seem to have any attacks of his own, There was no special beam, powers or any of the sort, just the hard resistant exterior and his super body self.

After throwing the spear though, Sil had gone one more and with his super speed, he ran towards the multiple tridents and grabbed onto the end of one, pushing it forward as it went right towards Kipo's head.

It slammed into his head, making a thunderous sound and the power of the weapon had even shook the waves and water that was on the moon, but it had still failed to pierce Kipo.

Splitting his hands again, it looked like Kipo was ready to do the same move as he had attempted against Borden, he brought both his hands together but it seems like even if he had performed a clap, it would fall short of where Sil was.

When both of Kipo's hands clapped together, a thunderous bang was heard, and a loud rush of power had exploded the one standing in front of him. Sil was no more, and instead a cloud of smoke had appeared.

'That wasn't the real one?' Kipo thought

"You're wrong." a voice said off to the side. "I could beat any celestial that came after me, and that includes you."

Turning around, Kipo could see an army, an army of Sil's that numbered in the 1000's and judging by the smile on Sil's face, for some reason he was confident he could win this fight.

*****

# Chapter 1921 Too Powerful

Vorden had been watching everything from the side, but even he didn't know when Sil had done the switch with his true self. Even he was worried when he saw the life of Sil disappear in front of his eyes, to feeling relief after seeing the cloud of smoke.

However, turning his head, all of sudden, there seemed to be around a 1000 or so Sil's, coming from another direction. Seemingly appearing out of nowhere.

"Sil… you have gained this much power? Are all these clones as powerful as the ones that have been fighting so far?" Vorden asked himself.

Each time, Sil was reaching new heights in his eyes, battling these so called gods, now he could see how a human was able to go toe to toe with them.

'Don't be jealous.' Raten stated in his mind. 'That guy was always different from us, and don't forget, I always kicked his arse when it came to hand to hand combat.'

Vorden smiled at this comment, remembering the memory from over a 1000 years ago.

"Are you telling me, that if you were to go into combat with him now, that you too would also be confident of winning."

Raten's silence said the answer, there was no chance, perhaps not even against one version of Sil, never mind this many.

"You were able to take on my lightning powers right? You're resistant to attacks, physical attacks, and all of that?" Sil replied. "Well, let's see how resistant you really are."

One tenth of the Sil's had begun to gather their power, and in doing so they had formed lightning around their arms in the form of tornadoes. Their eyes lit up blue as they were using all of the MC cell's in their body.

At the same time, the line behind them, had begun to form water particles in the air, small raindrops of water were gathering around them. In another direction, the Sil's that had demon tier weapons, another one held onto the weapon, and immediately the demon tier weapon had formed a copy, making a clone of the weapon itself .

After that, another clone of the Sil touched the weapon and it started to glow. One Sil was using all of his powers that allowed him to clone beast weapons. Due to the high number of MC cells and the level, it allowed for the clone of the weapon to be pretty close in power to the original.

Still, that didn't matter, because there were other Sil's in the group, that had an enhancement power. Somewhat similar to what Sera could do, but not at the same level. Sil was improving the power of the weapons that he held in his hand.

Among all the 1000s of Sil's that were presented, each of them were enhancing their powers, the water and lightning were to go together to create a devastating attack. Flames could be seen in the distance ready to melt the power of earth and create molten lava rock.

While the ten clones were fighting, Sil was busy making all of his clones the strongest possible. There was one down side to his soul weapon and that was the time it took to switch out his abilities.

However, the plus side was that each clone that Sil would create would have the abilities of Sil when it was made. Meaning he could create a whole bunch of Super Sil's, all with the power of that which was in the book. Not just lightning, fire, but even more, and powers that complimented each other well.

"If you can survive this… then maybe the world was doomed in the first place." Sil said, as the attack rushed from the thousands of Sil's.

Some of them ran in with their super speed sacrificing themselves, but with a weapon in their hand. Lightning, fire and all sorts of powers were coming straight towards Kipo.

As he stood there, even he looked startled at everything coming towards him. The black like tribal tattoos on his body started to move again, and for the first time, rather than just taking the hit, it appeared as if he was attacking back.

Streams of powers were coming towards him, in all sorts of forms, shapes, and even looking somewhat like mythical beasts. Opening his hands wide, Kipo swung them making a big clap, destroying a lot of the powers that were in front of him, but it was useless.

There were just too many attacks. Five Sil's with demon tier swords in their hands had struck him down. Other Sil's with demon tier whips had thrown them out, encircling Kipo. As he used his strength to try to pull and break free, ice from all sorts of different directions had held him in place.

It was impossible for Kipo to move, or do anything else any more. That's when the rush of attacks had hit him. A large explosion of powers was being used and was destroying the ground. It looked to have caused nearly everything that was on one half of the moon to be destroyed as green life and more was coming to an end.

The powers continued and Kipo could no longer be seen from the outside, and it was true for Sil as well. With the trident returning in his hand, but not only his hand. A hundred others who had enhanced weapons. Sil threw it out as hard as he could.

Water gathered around it giving it a boost, as it spun and propelled itself forward, there were triple tridents next to it, but not because it was using the ability to clone itself, that was just how many Sil's had thrown the enhanced tridents out.

They all moved to one spot, and had hit Kipo right in the stomach. It stopped against his skin, as all of the attacks hit his body form all over. Then eventually, the tip of the trident could be seen piercing the skin.

"Second wave!" Sil shouted.

That was only the beginning of Sil's attack, as the back half of the Sil's had thrown out their attacks. Sil knew how resilient the skin of Kipo was, and he needed an opening, and was waiting for an opening.

The only thing was that Sil was losing energy fast. It was clear that this would be his last spell, and he knew it. If this attack didn't work then what else could he do, which was why he had carefully planned it the best he could.

As a break in the skin could be seen, several powers began to creep in and now move towards the inside of Kipo. A strange sensation that he had never felt before had come over him, the feeling of pain. Of real pain as his insides were being burnt, poisoned, ripped apart. Every imaginable thing possible had entered Kipo body now and was attempting to make the worst damage possible.

"Let me do something too!" Borden asked.

Hearing this, Sil had recalled one of the tridents and it was now back in his hand. After that he handed it to Borden, allowing him to throw it with all his might. It went fast, hard, and strong, but that's when the trident had gone completely through the attacks, it had gone over to the other side and eventually fell, piercing the ground.

The two of them looked at each other strangely.

Sil could feel his energy fading, and so could the others, so they chose to pull back their attack. The energy started to fade, and the light and giant crater could be seen in its place. However, there was no Kipo. There was nothing.

"When… when did he die?" Sil asked.

"I have no idea, couldn't you see anything?" Borden asked.

"No…  I was just attacking with all my power. With everything I had. Well, I guess, he's not a problem anymore." Sil smiled, thinking that he had averted the crisis of the Blade family. That they were now all safe.

What this event did do though, was set off a chain of reactions, because if there was one celestial that they never expected to lose a fight, it was Kipo.

*****

# Chapter 1922 The Constant White Light

Sil stood there in place looking at where Kipo once was, there was nothing, not even a single remaining body part. Instead, it was more like a quarter of the moon had been ripped off due to his attacks.

Several large chunks could be seen floating in the air from the battle. If Sil was honest, it was probably the strongest and largest attack he had ever produced before in one go, getting all of his clones to work like that.

Due to the mass change, perhaps the current orbit of the moon around Mars would not be like it once was.

Eventually, Vorden had come out from where he was and Borden had come over as well, reverting back to his more human-like state.

"Well, you certainly did a number on him." Borden said. "I only got to hit him a few times. I didn't even get to use my full strength."

"We know you are strong." Vorden said as he stood next to them. "But with enemies like this, maybe we don't have time for you to get hurt to show your full strength. Anyway, the threat is dealt with but what exactly was that? Do you have any idea Sil?"

Sil thought about it for a while, the others somewhat knew the truth and if anything, if something was to happen to Sil then it would mean that it would be up to these guys to protect the Blade family.

"I have a feeling that it's the celestials, as for why they went after me, I'm not really sure, but I foresaw this would happen. He was incredibly strong, I'm just happy that the crisis has been averted." Sil stated.

The others were wondering what crisis Sil was referring to, but at the same time, due to his calm demeanor and the slight smile on his face, they thought since he was happy they would leave it. There must have been a reason why he was so worried.

Sil began to walk over to the destroyed part of the moon, he didn't teleport back just yet, because there was something in Sil's gut telling him that maybe there was a chance that the celestial would just come back and that it wasn't really dead.

Sure Sil had used up a large number of his MC cells but he still had fight in him, and he himself had hardly been hurt. Thinking back, he started to compare the fight that he had with Kipo against the one he had with Athos.

Although the fight with Athos took both him and Quinn to defeat, in ways Kipo was harder. Athos was large in size, and it was his celestial energy that made it difficult to beat him.

Even with 1000's of clones of Sil, it wasn't as if he could take out Athos due to his large scale of attacks. With Kipo, he was a good fighter, and in the end, Sil had just overpowered him with abilities, but if that hadn't worked, then he would have had to truly fight against him in hand to hand combat.

If that was the case, Sil couldn't see a way of winning. Unlike that man, Hilston, Sil still wasn't that great of a hand to hand combat specialist, which was why he preferred using abilities above all else. Even with weapons he was somewhat subpar with skills.

At the same time Sil had grown stronger after that fight with Athos, something inside of him had started to grow, and with that final trident throw, Sil had managed to summon more Qi than he ever had done before.

Maybe that was the turning point that had allowed them to pierce the skin of Kipo, and finish off the fight.

"Shall we get going then?" Borden asked. "I mean, unless you want to enjoy the views of Mars or something."

As soon as Borden said those words, a reflection of light could be seen on each of their faces, casting a slight shadow on them. Meaning the light source was coming from above. Looking up, they could see a white energy that was swilling from above.

"No, this energy… is it another one!" Sil's whole face had sunken with shock. He had just dealt with one, using around 90 percent of his MC cell's. There hadn't been a lot of time for him to recover from the last fight, so if there was an opponent that would be at the same level then it would certainly be a struggle.

"I don't think it's over." Vorden stated, as he looked in another direction, and a bright white light could be seen in another area as well.

"The energy… I can tell they are both celestial energy." Sil looked panicked, and he was starting to think if the best option for them both was to teleport them out of the area.

Soon after, several more white lights started to appear in the sky. And it looked like more were gathering by the moment.

"Are the celestials sending an army after me? I need to warn Quinn about what is happening." Sil stated.

"Then let's get out of here!" Vorden shouted.

Sil started to open up a portal for all three of them to go through, the portal was opened in front of them ready to walk through, but then the next second he stopped just before entering the portal and stood there.

"Is something wrong?" Vorden asked.

"I can't go through this portal, I can't head back to the Blade ship. This could be what ends them all. At the end of the day, the most likely person that these celestials are after is me. If that is the case, then I will be the one that causes the end of the Blade family, it's because of me that they will all die."

It was the first time that Vorden had heard Sil speak in this way, back then in the past he was never overly concerned with anything, but Vorden could tell that it was serious.

"Then we fight them together, you're weak right now, and I doubt you could take these guys on." After saying these words, Vorden turned around, and was ready to head back, but a few seconds later, he felt someone grab him from behind. The next second he was pulled backwards, and flung behind him.

His body went through the portal, and he could see on the other side Sil was there, he could see the portal slowly closing. Vorden tried his best to rebalance himself but he was thrown with such strength that he bounced on the metallic floor, and eventually hit the side of the inner metallic ship of the Blade family.

The others rushed towards him as they saw that it looked like Vorden was hurt, but he soon got up despite his injuries and he had anger covering his whole face.

"Damn you Sil, don't you trust us anymore? Are you really going to take on this task all by yourself!" Vorden shouted at the top of his lungs.

Although he said this, when Vorden thought about it more, he started to realize that perhaps there was a reason for this, and if Sil really decided to do this. There had to be a reason and maybe the Blade family wasn't up for this.

"Try to contact everyone… contact Logan, get Jake Green here, and try to get in contact with Quinn as well." Vorden ordered and immediately everyone was on the move.

——

Back on the moon, the portal had closed and Borden was still there along with Sil.

"Thank you for not throwing me back there, not that I would have let you anyway." Borden smiled.

"Of course." Sil replied. "I had an inkling that you would resist so there was no worry, and besides if we are going to do this anyway. I might need you to help me recover."

Borden began to transform his body once more, and Sil started to focus. At that moment, the bright white light started to shine on the moon, not just in one place but several, as an army of celestials were now coming after them.

*****


# Chapter 1923 A New Weapon (Part 1)

A heavy task had been given to the blood fairy Alex Way, and he was given a room by Logan to work on the task. Compared to the past, it wasn't that common to have forgers these days since technology had primarily taken over that role.

That was why forgers were in higher demand compared to before. Of course, the room was open compared to the other forgeries he worked in, but it was laid out exactly as it was many years ago before he had gone into slumber.

The furnace, the different tools in the room, the working worktops and more, everything was there for him to do the best job in his life. There were two tasks for him, to repair the Blue fang set and also to create a demon-tier blood weapon using the Celestial blood that had been given to him by Quinn.

The armor had been set out and laid on a table, while at the same time, the crystals were laid out by their side. The blood was stored in a large tube-like container that was electronically designed by Logan Green.

"This is going to be a hard task, and if Quinn wants it as soon as possible, then I'm going to have to pull an all-nighter," Alex said to himself.

Before he started, he craned his body to one side, a few clicks could be heard, followed by several crack sounds. There was a great relief as he went on and did the same on the other side, trying to click every bone in his body.

After that, Alex ripped his shirt off his upper body, throwing the pieces of cloth that were on him to the ground. Allowing his blood-red wings to be free. The room was already hot, making his sweat drip down on his body, slowly streaming over his rock-hard abs, which were carved like in the Greek statues and just as hard.

Getting to work, Alex picked up a hammer. It felt good in his hand, just the right shape and fit. He stroked it a few times, remembering the good old times.

"Ah, it's good to be back, Betsy, my trusty hammer."

The sound of clanging began to occasionally be heard from the room. Starting off, Alex got to work on the armor. Although he was able to alternate between the two weapons as there was a framing and heating process that would take hours.

Before he had turned into a blood fairy, he remembered all the aches that his body would get from working, but now it was nothing to him. The armor work was going well, and while it was being heated in a specially made mold, he was going to work on the weapon.

'Everything is so much easier compared to before. Things really have changed compared to the past.' Alex smiled at the thought.

The use of technology allowed him to be less fiddly and also reduced the chances of making mistakes as well. With his fine touches, he was sure that he would create the best equipment there was and that the armor would have better effects than it did before because if it didn't, then he would consider himself a failure as a forger.

Now, as he started working on the weapon, he began first with the crystals, which were given by Quinn. They needed to be melted, and not to forget, there was also what Jake Green had managed to obtain as well. Inspecting them and seeing what their traits were, was a skill of a forger, and he would have to find which type of crystals were the best to use in combination with each other.

"Quinn's current set of skills, at least as far as I know them, focus more on defence than before. He has the shadow, so he doesn't really need something defensive, at the same time, the armor set will still focus on speed. Maybe something to complement that would be good as well."

Alex then picked three of the demon tier crystals and placed them in three separate tubes. A metal casing came down as the advanced technological mechanisms went to work in terms of melting the crystal into pure energy.

After that, there was a new metal that was solid gold in colour, and had streaks of gold cracks somewhat like veins running through it. It looked like a piece of marble but not the one that was available on earth.

It was a material that Alex had never worked with before but was meant to be harder than Galthrium. It was a rare material that Logan had claimed would work well. It had only been used on small parts of spaceships before and had worked out well. But never before had it been used on a weapon before.

Because of this, Alex had decided to work on a small part of the metal at first. He had already done this while waiting for Quinn to get the parts that were needed. So he had a good sense of it, and he, too, agreed with Logan that this would not only make a good weapon but the best weapon in the world.

"Okay, so now, it's time to make the molding for the weapon as well. Based on the demon tier crystal I picked, there shouldn't be too much problem based on whatever mold they are made into. I know some crystals work better based on the mold that is being used."

Thinking hard, a few weapons that Quinn could use came to his head. Of course, there were the classic Gauntlets that could be used. However, there was Quinn's soul weapon and also his normal armor that he used.

"I want this to be a weapon, one that can actually be used….this is harder than I thought."

After thinking for a while, eventually, the perfect weapon came to Alex's head. Immediately, he started to use his hammer to hit a piece of metal to create the outside molding.

With excitement and power in his eyes, after each strike, his rings vibrated a red pulse of power. This allowed for the mold to be created perfectly in place that had been crafted rather than being machine-made. Something that Alex had a feeling for and set his mind to forge it.

After working on this for two days straight and making sure there were no imperfections, he finally completed the mold. As he had been too focused on one aspect, he had forgotten about the armor.

'I would usually finish off the armor first before continuing on the weapon, but every time I think of the weapon, and Quinn using this thing, I just get so excited.' Alex thought, and his wings started to flutter so much that he was lifted around two inches off the ground.

Using the melting materials from the demon tier crystals, there was a need to mix them perfectly so that they would complement each other. And depending on what attribute and type of active skill, this needed to be done in a certain way.

Alex had a lot of experience doing this, to the point where he could somewhat guess the type of active skill that would be released from the weapon. Over the years, he had perfected his technique beyond that of average forgers.

Still, with the weapon he had in mind, he got to work mixing all the different demon tiers crystals, but there was one more step to all of this, and that was Quinn's blood. Going to the strange large cylinder, Alex twisted it and put the code given to him by Logan.

While in the container, the blood was shining bright, it glowed and lit up the entire place, even making Alex's face look red.

"I've never seen blood so bright like this before. Is Quinn even human anymore? I guess he really isn't. Well, now let's just try and see if this works." Alex said.

The demon tier liquid was mixing in a strange device. This part would usually have to be manually done while also adding the blood in a small amount at a time. The machine was doing the mixing part, which meant that now Alex could focus on pouring the blood.

Bit by bit, the blood started to mix in, and strangely the blood seemed to be overpowering the demon-tier crystal that was inside.

"This is crazy! How can the blood have more energy than the demon tier crystal? This doesn't make any sense!"

Using the remaining liquid and energy of the demon tier crystal he had, Alex went back and started to add more of the raw materials. Through this process, he handed more blood and eventually even needed to use another demon tier crystal to balance off the whole thing. He was being very careful throughout the process, and his years of experience gave him an edge and confidence to do everything perfectly, but that's when he suddenly noticed something strange as the blood began to bubble and rise.

It began to flow out from the large container like it was alive. The blood looked like small snakes, and they all started to point towards Alex.

"Why does this feel like I'm in trouble?" Alex said as the glowing blood, mixed with the demon tier energy and celestial blood energy, went straight towards him.

*****

# Chapter 1924 A New Weapon (Part 2)

The blood that Quinn had given him was clearly alive. It had sprung up from the container and rose into small strands and threads, pointing right toward Alex.

"This is new," Alex tilted his head to the side, "In all my years of forging and working with strange materials, something like this has never happened before. Then again, I have never worked with this type of blood before, either."

An ominous feeling was coming over Alex, and there was a good reason for it. Because the next moment, the strands of blood dashed towards him. They stretched out, thinning themselves and knowing whose blood it was, Alex had a reasonable fear that it could be deadly.

His wings started to flutter rapidly as he flew up and began to avoid the strands. Moving left, right, spinning and darting in and out. However, the blood strands would follow him around the room from one corner to another as if they were endlessly long.

'Good thing I love these wings. I practiced with them any chance I got, but still, I don't know how long I can hold on. I've been hammering the mold with no rest for two days straight, and now I wouldn't be surprised if I passed out at any moment from exhaustion.'

As he continued to fly around the room, Alex was faster than the blood strands that were chasing after him, but he was trying to figure out a way to stop them and to find out what this blood was trying to do.

Already exhausted from all this and distracted by his thoughts, Alex had slowed down a bit, and instantly one of the strands had reached Alex, grabbing him right by the ankle. However, rather than pricking his skin, it had wrapped around the foot.

Alex could feel something tugging at him as he attempted to fly away with all his power, but when he did, it pulled him down. Within seconds, more strands of the celestial blood wrapped around his limbs and torso, pulling him down with even greater force.

The force was so great he couldn't even get out of their hold and was dragged across the floor. It continued to pull him towards the strange vat container filled with different liquids.

"Is this blood thing trying to eat me or something?!" Alex panicked, genuinely concerned as he got pulled closer and closer.

"I can't even beat this strengthened blood. How weak am I? And just how strong is Quinn's blood? Look, let me go. I'm trying to put you in a nice weapon. A weapon that you can be a part of, you will enjoy your life there, I promise!"

It wouldn't be long before he got swallowed into the vat of liquids, and Alex was not curious to know what would happen if that happened. Opening his mouth wide, he released a part of his special aura at the ground in front of him.

It was somewhat of a blood aura breath attack, but of course properties of the blood aura were different compared to that of a Blood Fairy. Releasing the attack, looking down, Alex believed that he had to try anything to get out of the situation he was in.

Opening up his mouth again, he released another blood breath, but this time targeted his own leg, right around the thigh where one of the red threads had tied around him. He had looked at his arm for a second, but he couldn't hit them. If he did, then he wouldn't be able to finish the weapon in time for Quinn when he needed it most because his arm would be injured.

However, all this was for a nought because although the blood breath had successfully hit the glowing red thread, it had done nothing to harm it. However, the glow had somewhat weakened, and the strings were starting to lose up as if the string's energy was absorbed by the attack.

'My blood, it still has somewhat of the same effect as it does against vampire blood usually.'

With this in Alex's mind, he didn't hesitate to focus on his other leg and did the same there. When the blood dripped down his thigh, around to his ankles, the strings loosened up there as well.

When he kicked up his legs, blood spattered everywhere and loosened around his arms as well due to the pull. Now, with all his strength, he was able to fly free, breaking away from the blood strings. With a turn of the head though, he could see that they were still behind him.

'Will you give me a break!' Alex was frustrated. He continued to fly, fly and fly away until he was near the exit of the room. Turning his head back once again, he could see that the threads were no longer chasing after him.

They had reached three-quarters of the room but were unable to reach further than that. The blood strands had also become aware of this fact and began to crawl back towards the vat of liquid, and everything in the room seemed normal again.

Finally, his wings could rest for a bit, and as Alex fell to the floor, he shut his eyes for some well-deserved rest. When he opened his eyes and got up, he didn't know how much time had passed since there was no clock in the room at his own request.

Looking at the time would only make him paranoid and would only distract him even more. However, his legs had now healed, but he could still remember what had happened just before he passed out.

'So the blood can't reach me from this far, but I still need to work with the liquid somehow.'

There was no solution, for now, so he got up and walked towards the nearby corner to work on the Blue Fang set while also thinking about how to deal with the blood strands.

However, because of the distraction and the fact that he didn't want to experience the sudden adrenaline rush once again due to the blood strands, he was taking longer than he usually would have.

Eventually, when he was done, he let out a long sigh.

"I guess I should at least work on that strange metal first. Once I have that, and the molds sorted out, I can then mix the two liquids and create the weapon. I guess I will just have to fly there, avoid everything, and move the blood along with the demon tier liquid right into the molds and get out of there."

Bracing himself and fluttering his wings as if he was raving up a car, Alex was ready for any moment now. Running first, Alex then leapt off the ground, and using his wings, he zapped straight towards the vat of liquids.

When he got close, the liquid started to move again, and the blood was alive once more. However, Alex had just grabbed the vat of liquid and lifted it up, moving towards where the other metal was swirling away in the mold.

His hands were burning as the surface of the vat was kept quite hot, but he held on, gritting his teeth and bearing the pain. He wanted to let go, as he felt over, but the thought of Quinn needing him, of the whole world learning his name after the creation of this weapon, had come into his head.

'This weapon…it gets me excited every time I think of it!' With this thought, Alex sped up and poured the liquid into the mold. It dripped on, mixing with the other metal. He quickly moved the vat, pouring the remainder of the liquid into the other mold and then, when all was set and done, he dropped the large container onto the floor.

His hands were in pain, and he landed on the floor as his shadow cast over the molds.

'Perfect, and now it's time for the cooling, and hopefully, you will have settled a bit, you crazy blood!' Alex thought as he pressed a button, and from above, a giant clamp slammed onto the two molds. At first, Alex was against the modern way of forging weapons with the help of technology, but now he could see how much it could help him.

When the giant clamp lifted up, the weapons were in front of him. He smiled from ear to ear, looking at them.

"This is it… they're beautiful. Now, time to send Quinn a message saying that they are done." Alex smiled as he turned around and started using the computer system to send the message. But while he was typing away, he suddenly felt something on his leg, and the next moment, Alex was dragged away.

# Chapter 1925 BB, Quinn, And The Celestial World

The other Celestials noticed the Celestial known as BB turn his head right and glance at them. Quinn had met quite a few celestials in his time, but it was the first time seeing this one—one that looked almost inhuman.

Weet was a celestial that looked more like a beast, but sensing the type of energy coming out from his body, without a doubt, he was a Celestial.

"Quinn…" Russ muttered when seeing him, but he couldn't find the right words to bring out of his mouth. Right now, his life was possibly on the line, and there was an old enemy in front of him. Without a doubt, if the old enemy, Quinn, chose to go and work with the celestial in front of him, it would be the death of him.

'I learn a bit about these people from Bliss. Quinn is the same as them, right? So there is a good chance that he will turn on me,' Russ thought.

"Look, I'll be honest." Quinn finally spoke. "I'm only here because I was told to come here by another celestial, even though I'm not really the one who would listen to her. And, I think you might know her, her name is Bliss."

Weet was quite surprised to hear the name that had come out of BB's mouth.

'She was the one that called him here? Are the two working together? Now that's quite a surprise. Perhaps this news needs to be passed on to others. There is clearly more to this than meets the eye,' Weet thought.

"The reason why you and I are here is the same," Weet explained, "The universe was the one that told us that we should exist. I will not get in your way, and I wish you do the same.

"Both of our lives would be better off this way, don't you agree?"

Weet was quite convincing. And honestly, with celestials, Quinn could never tell their strength. It was always hard because even if they had incredibly strong celestial energy, it wouldn't directly reflect on their fighting capabilities.

At the same time, Russ wasn't saying a single word, not making a case for himself.

"Sorry, I don't mean to ignore you," Quinn said, "But I really need to ask this person a question. Weren't you meant to be dead? I'm sure I saw you die. Didn't I kill you?"

Russ just realised that Quinn seemed to have seen him dead, and based on the tone of voice Quinn had used before, he didn't particularly seem to get along with Bliss. So to inform him that he was working with her in the past wouldn't exactly go well with him.

Russ smiled and quickly prepared an answer.

"Just like that giant bird said, the reason why we are all here is the same. I'm sure it's the same for you. Bliss was also the one who asked me to come here."

Thinking about it, since Quinn had been called, maybe others had done as well, and honestly, it was the only reason why Quinn hadn't acted straight away. Because she had said, the fate of the world counted on this.

Usually, he would ignore this, but he hadn't done so because he had heard of the coming future from Sil. Although he didn't trust Bliss, he trusted Sil. So it was somewhat certain that at some point in the future, the celestials would become his enemy.

"Don't you hate me?" Quinn asked.

"Me? Yeah, I'm upset about the wedding, but it doesn't really bother me. I have been living a peaceful life after leaving the Chained. I don't have a real grudge with you, but only with the Blade family, which you seem to be closely connected with," Russ clarified his intentions.

Quinn shook his head upon hearing this.

"Okay… I'm sorry again, but I was actually asking the bird, not you. I guess many people don't like me, so that would be confusing."

Turning to the bird celestial, Quinn now made it clear.

"I wanted to ask you the same question. Don't you guys hate me? So won't you eventually attack me as well? If that's the case, then I might as well get rid of you now."

Russ couldn't believe it, he had seen Quinn fight before, and sure the latter was stronger due to the help of his energy, but when fighting against Weet just moments ago, it was a strange strength that he just wasn't used to.

If the two of them fought, honestly, Russ would have to give Weet the edge, they could only take on this celestial together. The way Quinn was talking to the one in front of him, it was like he was far superior compared to the other.

"You are certainly confident, BB," Weet replied. "First, if you call me a bird again, then I will have to create a hole through your head. Second, the celestials you fought against before were extremely low-level, not even worth cannon fodder.

"I am not the same, and on top of that, I want to make it clear, if you are to follow the celestial way and not go against the ancient ones and us, then we will have no problem with you. And since you have not got in my way yet, this will be more favourable to you."

The situation wasn't looking good for Russ, and he believed he would need to think of a way out of this situation. That was when Quinn started to do something he hadn't since he got there, he sniffed the air, and a familiar smell could be smelt.

"There's blood, far away in the distance." Quinn said, "Is that because of you? Did you hurt the people that were here?"

Weet flapped his wings.

"I'm confused, why would you ask such a useless question? Why does it matter? I know you haven't been a celestial for long, but you should know by now that the world is just made up of energy. They don't matter, and we are here to do as we wish."

Quinn then shook his head.

"You know, you almost had me. I don't really like this guy behind me, but the thing is, I'm pretty sure that I can control him, in a way. Or at least convince him not to harm others. But you celestials are different…you guys can't be controlled, and I don't expect you to be, but I know you have already started to shove your nose into our business."

Immediately, Weet knew this was a threat. He flapped his wings and went high up into the air. At the same time, Quinn's eyes started to glow red, and the blood from the nearby town was moving toward him.

It was going to be another fight with a Celestial. He wondered how hard this would be compared to when he fought against Athos. And since they had sent out a celestial to fight them, Quinn imagined it would be tougher, but he was far stronger than the last fight. And he now had great amounts of Celestial energy as well.

"This is not a fight you want to be a part of," Quinn said as he raised his hand and started to gather his vampire aura. "Since you gave me the chance to go away, I will give you the chance to leave this fight and leave the human race.

"If possible, I would like to send out a message back to you all. Stop meddling in the affairs of the human race, Vampires, or any territory that I can control!"

The laser attack that Weet was doing before was now charging up once again, and that was why Russ had decided to act as well.

"I will need the help of your mind again, I hope the strongest thing in your mind is still that Dragon of yours!" Russ shouted.

At that moment, he raised his hand up, and a large shadow appeared above, and dropping out of it once again, was the legendary dragon that had appeared before.

'This is the last of my energy, I hope it's enough.'

*****

# Chapter 1926 Three Great Powers

Weet had long started to accumulate his power, and to Russ, it seemed like his new attack would than the ones he used against him earlier. And as the Celestial's upper body leaned backwards, the wings on his back were lighting up, and even his dark claws were starting to glow a slightly bluish tinge.

Russ, seeing this, was wondering just how strong this attack would be.

At the same time, maybe if he had known about this attack, he would have been able to do something earlier.

'I thought he had used all of the attacks against me, that nothing would work against the dragon's impenetrable armour, but I guess he had something else up his sleeve. When fighting against Quinn, I can use his imagination to work on the Dragon...but this…is difficult. This celestial is going to be a very difficult enemy, even with the dragon and Quinn being here.'

While the Dragon was doing its work, Russ hoped it would be strong enough to stop the attack, so he could get a chance to look at something else, like looking deep into Weet's mind to find if there was something he could take advantage of, or use to defeat the Celestial. Although he didn't have any more MC cells to summon another being like the dragon, he could still maybe find something for later.

'What is going on?' Quinn on the other hand was observing everything, and wasn't planning to participate just yet. 'He summoned the Dragon again. But he isn't even fighting against me? Just what is his power, and that Dragon….I originally thought they might be illusions or something like that, but it's…clearly different. Is this why Bliss sent me here? Is it not to stop that Celestial bird Weet but to help Russ? Is his power important? What is she playing at?'

While in the middle of thinking this, Quinn continued to observe everything. With keen eyes, he was trying to understand the Celestial's power, however, he was actually more interested in the Dragon that was in front of him. It was just like before, yet a bit different.

"Quinn, what are you doing?!" Russ shouted, seeing the former stand still. "Now is your chance! While the Dragon is fighting against the thing, you need to use your powers as well, only then will we be able to defeat this guy!"

"It's best to watch these things because you never know what can happen," Quinn replied without explaining much. He had learned his lesson from the battle against Athos, and this time he was going with a different strategy.

The large Dragon, which only had one head as it did before its full form, started to fly straight towards the Celestial. In size, the Dragon was around ten times bigger than the Celestial.

The Dragon opened its mouth as a breath of fire brewed in its mouth. The next second it erupted and crashed into the celestial, covering its entire body. The Dragon continued moving forward because it knew it wouldn't be enough to finish it.

When the flames stopped, it opened its giant mouth, and the inside of its mouth could be seen, ready to gobble up Weet whole. At that moment, the beam of energy came off from the latter's body. Several points of power and lasers came off in one direction and headed towards the Dragon's head.

Immediately, the Dragon changed its direction, attempting to avoid this, as it flew higher toward the sky. The lasers coming off from Weet continued to follow the Dragon, but it was far too fast in its movement, and taking a dive, it headed straight for Weet.

Its wings recoiled closer to its body, allowing it to cut through the air and drop quicker, and before Weet even knew it, the Dragon had slammed its body right on top of him. A loud bang resounded, and the attack sent shockwaves from the sky onto the ground, and it pushed the rubble and debris from the battle so far off to the side.

'That Dragon, I knew it was strong when I saw it, and the fact that Andy and the others could not get past it at that time when it was summoned at the wedding, I thought it would be useful this time as well.' Russ thought. 'Just what did Quinn go through to have a beast this strong in his mind?'

While thinking this, Russ also thought about a few others that he could see in Quinn's mind. However, although he could sense multiple strong energies in Quinn's mind, he wasn't so sure what to use, which was why he had played it safe.

Trying to figure out why Quinn had yet to do anything, Russ was looking for other things to summon from the strange Bird beast's mind. It was clear he was working for someone, and at the same time, if he was strong, then the bird must know others as well.

'The dragon might not last, and if Quinn does fight against this, then it might be enough time for me to recover from summoning something else or something that can help me get out of this place.' Russ thought as he closed his eyes and focused.

Looking deep into the mind of the celestial Weet, he searched and searched until he came across something. While using this part of his ability, everything came slightly distorted and wishy-washy, so the figures and the images that Russ saw at the moment were unclear.

However, there were, for some reason, three distinct images. These were more distorted than others in the entire place, and looking at where they were, they were just three gigantic coolers of energy around the same size as a mountain.

They were green, yellow and blue in shade. Something was drawing Russ in towards them, but at the same time was nearly making his own figure disappear, that was until he heard something.

"Get out." A voice vibrated through the entire area, and Russ's body turned into nothing but dust, being blown away. When he opened his eyes, Russ felt his heart beating severely as he found himself on his knees, gasping for air.

Looking up, he was on the grass meadow-like field again, with the fight still ongoing above him.

'What was that, in that damn bird's mind? Even in Quinn's mind, there was never anything like that. That power…is that who this person is working for?' Russ started to think.

The large slam from the Dragon hadn't worked, even if it had used its strange wing claw's to curl up into a ball. And even with that scale of an attack, it seemed like Weet's defence was impossible to get through.

At the same time, since the concentrated lasers weren't working against the Dragon, Weet split up his attack, creating a large star over the Dragon. Then, moving all of the lasers towards a centre point, he trapped the Dragon.

Confused, the Dragon attempted to break free, but as the laser hit its skin, it hurt and forced it to find another way out, but it was too late as all of the lasers went through the grand Dragon and concentrated on the centre as a large hole appeared through the Dragon's body.

"I knew it wouldn't last long…but at the same time, it put up a better fight than I thought," Russ complained. "Now, if you fight against that thing, you will realise that you have already ruined our best chance."

"I wasn't just sitting idle here," Quinn replied as he opened his hands up. "I was carefully observing all his movements. The hardest thing about fighting this Celestial is the defence he gets through wings, so we need to just stop him from using that."

As Quinn lifted his hands in the air and looked in the sky itself, Russ also followed his gaze and could now see something in the sky, the tip of what looked like a giant sword made from blood.

"He made a big mistake after coming here, and that was killing all those people.. it's just going to make this a bit easier for me." Quinn swung his hands down, and the two swords moved at a great speed.

After releasing its attack, Weet was somewhat tired and failed to notice the attack from above as well because there was no celestial energy in the blood attack. This was just Quinn's pure blood energy. The swords slammed down right on top of his wings and dragged him through the air.

They hadn't pierced the wings, but that wasn't what was needed. Weet's body slammed into the ground, and the blood swords continued to rush energy down on top of the wings, pinning him to the ground.

"Without your wings, you aren't really much." Quinn stood over Weet with his soul weapon activated and having formed into a celestial Blood scythe. Swinging both his hands, the scythe went right through Weet's head, chopping it off and turning Weet into nothing but dust instantly.

Rubbing his eyes and getting off the ground, Russ couldn't believe it. Was it really over? The large threat, that easily…but how?

'Now, what was that message that I received from before?' Quinn thought as he had heard a few system prompts before he had begun to attack.

[Bliss]

[Don't kill the celestial.]

'Oh, well.'

# Chapter 1927 The Man Who Was

The strength that Quinn showed was beyond what Russ could remember. After all, it hadn't been that long since the Chained wedding. Of course, one could improve and obtain new weapons and the like as time passed, but somehow, the one in front of him, the one known as the Hero Quinn, had improved leaps and bounds. It was as if he was looking at a completely different person.

As Weet turned into nothing but dust particles, Quinn could not help but ponder over a few things. For one, he hadn't used the Energy Drain skill on the dead Celestial and yet, after defeating him, a large influx of Celestial points had been added via the system.

[A Celestial has been defeated]

[80,432 Celestial points have been obtained]

[365,894 Total Celestial points]

[162,256/365,894 Celestial energy]

'The amount of Celestial points isn't the same as before,' Quinn thought. 'I wonder why that is. There's no doubt Weet had great strength and had to be a Celestial that lived a long life like Athos. Maybe it's because of the way I killed them? Hmm... I guess I could have used Blood Forest to perch him in different places and absorb the blood. That seemed to work as well.'

While thinking about this as he stood in place, Quinn could feel something log on. Opening up his system, he quickly realised that he could see Peter's Celestial points. Not only could he see how many Celestial points one had, but how much was being used up as well. With that, the number attributed to Peter was currently going down.

There was no notification, and Quinn had long learnt how to use his powers without the use of the system, so he hardly opened it, which was why it was the first time he had noticed the lowering of Celestial points.

'Is this an upgrade to the system? Back when it was Level 1, fighting as I gave the others Celestial points, I don't remember ever seeing this.'

Either way, Quinn now knew that Peter was in a fight, or at least, that was the most likely case. Nevertheless, based on the amount of Celestial points he was using up, he was nearing his end.

'Peter's body is strong. It always has been strong, and he's been right behind me all this time. Could it be? Is Peter also one of the ones being targeted by the Celestials? Then again, why would a Celestial even be here in the first place?'

'No, if not Peter, then it might be Chris as well. In any case, I need to help them. Peter, I hope I'm not wrong and your body can take this. Either way, win your fight!'

[80,000 Celestial points have been transferred]

'I can always take them back once this is done.'

With that done, all Quinn could do was wait and see if Peter would no longer be seen in his system. After all, he was certain that he would get a notification if Peter did die in battle. So, for now, he was hoping that there wouldn't be any new messages.

Looking around the place, he noticed that a certain someone, who was there not too long ago, was no longer present. From the looks of it, they seemed to have escaped.

'That slippery eel had gotten away from me last time, and he seems to know Bliss, I can't let him go this time.'

Sniffing the air, it wasn't hard for Quinn to find out what direction Russ had gone in. Soon after, he immediately started to run in that direction. As he did so, he could not help but think, how did Russ manage to fool him before? How did he cover his scent?

After running through the fields for a while, Quinn was now directly in front of Russ, throwing out a fist that stopped just an inch away from his face.

"I don't think I need to tell you that I can get rid of you at any point and time. I'm guessing you don't have the same amount of energy you had the last time we fought." Quinn stated.

Seeing the fist and the amount of control Quinn had over all of his powers, Russ knew it was absolutely useless for him to do anything.

"Okay, you got me. I won't try to escape." Russ said, lifting his hands. "Since you haven't killed me outright, then I can assume you have some questions from me. However, if you plan to kill me after all your questions have been answered... then I'll just have to mix in a few lies in my answers."

"I can get rid of the Qi surrounding your head." Quinn replied. "And use that to just force the correct answers out of you. I'm very different from the other vampires you've dealt with."

"Okay, okay. Ask away." Russ inwardly sighed, knowing fully well that Quinn was most likely telling the truth.

With that, a series of questions were asked, such as what he knew about the one that attacked him and what had happened beforehand. However, Russ didn't know much, which prompted Quinn to move onto the next set of questions which revolved around Bliss.

"Why would she ask me to save you?" Quinn asked.

"I honestly don't know." Russ shrugged his shoulders. "I only worked with her because I owed her a large favour. She was the one that introduced me to my powers, after all. Well, a way to fully explore them properly. Because of that, I thought that if I continued to follow her, I could get everything I wanted."

"However, after my meeting with you, I was pretty much left on my own, to be on my own rather. So, I have no idea why she would save me, unless it's because she still has some sort of use for me. That's all I know."

From his heartbeat, it didn't sound like Russ was lying, so he was inclined to believe that he was telling the truth.

"I'm sorry, but until I can figure out the reason as to why she wanted you saved, you'll be coming with me." Quinn lifted his hand. Soon, a shadow appeared behind Russ placing him in the shadow space.

Now, Quinn needed to decide on what to do. He had no trails on Bliss, nor did he really know where Peter was. In the end, the best choice was to continue with his original plan of bringing Fex back and using the celestial points to revive his power so he could see the end of all of this.

Since it was an inhabited land, there were plenty of ships that Quinn could use. He could not help but be sad about what happened to the people, but there wasn't much he could do since they were all dead. Leaving them as they were was the best thing for now as he headed back for Mars.

In the middle of his journey back, he had received a message from Alex, stating that his weapon was done. Quinn assumed that at any point and time now, he could travel back to Alex and would definitely do so after he had resolved this matter with Fex.

Eventually, Quinn had returned to Mars and had returned to where Andy was. Upon arriving, there was a lot of new information that needed to be revealed to Quinn.

"We can still head to my father's location, but I just wanted to let you know something," Andy said with a gulp as he brought up a projector screen in the air, showing him the countless news reports that were going off.

"At first, I was worried that information about you would get out there, that the world would know about the Great Quinn returning. After all, there were few rumours that had spread among the staff."

"However, the world seems to be concerned with another thing right now. Specifically, these Celestials that have arrived on Earth."

The video clip was of Peter, Owen and the others fighting against the Celestial. As Quinn already expected somewhat that something was going on, it was hard to tell how many more would come.

"They're strong. Peter is still alive and they won their fights. I know the others can do the same," Quinn stated. "In any case, it's time to wake up Fex, get my new weapon, and find Erin and Zero, ending our troubles in this place once and for all."

# Chapter 1928 Not Again...

As usual, Logan was going through his normal duties as the leader of Green City and the current representative for the human race. With what had just happened to Pure, it looked like the next general election would be put on hold.

In the first place, there wasn't even an opposing candidate, not one that could actually stand to run against Logan Green. Although, there were rumours that he was behind the attack and had somehow convinced Chris.

Nevertheless, that still didn't stop people from swaying over to Logan's side for a number of reasons, such as setting up programs to show support for those from the ship Rein, as well as also continuing to run the city the same way it had been for the rest of the people.

On top of that, there was the fact that Chris had attacked them. Even if he had joined Logan's side, people believed that there had to be a reason for that. Then again, there also seemed to be hardcore supporters of Chris among the people from Pure.

These people were those who had been directly saved by him, looked after and trained by him. They refused to believe that Chris had actually betrayed them, and this seemed to ease the tension and climb of Logan Green behind the attacks.

While going through the town's system as it gathered reports, in his special lab, he quickly noticed something strange. Information was flooding into him, but he could see that Alex was in the middle of doing something.

'Alex was trying to send a message with the computer system. I wonder what he was trying to do, and why he didn't send it.' Logan thought to himself.

Eventually, curiosity had gotten the better of him, prompting him to check the message. While checking the message out, he soon realised who it was meant to be sent to. With his ability, it was easy to access the message's contents as it was saved as a draft on the system.

'A message for Quinn… from what's written here, it looks like the weapon is done. I wonder why the message wasn't sent out, then? Maybe he thought he hit send, and it didn't actually send.' Because of this thought, Logan decided to send the message on his behalf. Soon, the message was sent while Logan returned to do his work.

In the meantime, he was currently checking out the reports of the Celestials, seeing just how many attacks there were, and if there was some sort of pattern to what they were doing.

"How can you sleep all day, everyday? Are you some type of happy dog or something?" A female voice asked.

Surprisingly, Logan wasn't alone in the room. In fact, there were two other people, people that had been somewhat left behind by Quinn to do their own things.

Hearing these words, Mitchell slowly started to lift his body from the floating bed. Unlike other beds, it would fold up on its own when not in use. In fact, as Mitchell got off the bed, it had done just that as he went over to the woman complaining.

"There isn't much for us to do around here… what do you want to do, then? Should we try training and spar against each other?" Mitchell asked.

Ceril was annoyed by this comment, but she was more annoyed with the whole situation so far. In the first place, she felt like ever since she had gotten back with Quinn, she had done nothing. Sure, she somewhat understood that due to what she had changed, it was best for her to leave. In fact, she was even thankful to Quinn for saving her life.

However, at the same time, she could not help but feel like life had become very boring.

"I can tell you're bored, but everyone is doing other things, trying to help people," Mitchell told her. "Besides, I was serious with my suggestion. Although you're similar to us, you're not like us. We can establish that with a simple test."

"You know, before I joined Quinn and his gang, I was an instructor of sorts to the vampires. I think it would be interesting to see just what you can do. I wonder what your abilities are like and what powers do you have?"

Hearing that, Ceril lifted her hand, staring at her palm. Before, there were two traits the Memorial race had. One of them was the fact that they could control water around them. It was somewhat similar to the water ability that humans had.

The other one was the ability to transform. They had two forms, one when touching water and the other when out of water. However, ever since turning into whatever she was, she hadn't ever tried to control water after that. She did not even attempt to get in water to see what would happen.

'I think I'm scared… After all, if I can't change, then that means I really have no connection with my people. I guess that's what I'm afraid of.' Ceril clenched her fists soon after.

"Is there even any point to me controlling my powers?" Ceril asked in a slightly defeated tone as she sat down on the floor.

"That is up for you to decide," Mitchell answered. "Everyone has their own journey, but yours is truly special. Maybe you don't know much about Quinn or the humans, but the person who saved you is a true hero."

"From what I know, he saved your planet, as well as your race. Plus, if I can remember correctly, you are the first of his creations." Saying these words, Mitchell was staring off into an empty space, as if he was stuck in a trance.

"You see, I believe that you are the first of many creations that Quinn might create in the future. Just like the vampires, there will be many of you. With that said, there will be many of Quinn's creations."

"For me, I honestly think him protecting us is something that should just be a side job of his. Instead, I wish for him to fulfill his role as a god."

"The human race will always have problems, and he shouldn't always be there to protect them. Anyways, I apologise for the rant. However, that is what I believe. If you really think about it, you are the first, the first being that Quinn has created. Don't you think you should take the lead and show everyone what you can do?"

Hearing Mitchell talk about Quinn in such a way, only now did she realise just how much this vampire admired him. Sure, it was true that she didn't know much about Quinn or his history. She also didn't care to learn about it because she was too busy sulking about what she had become and what she had done.

"Okay, old man. I thought you're just some person who likes to sleep a lot, but let's see what you've got. Just so you know, us princesses underwent quite a bit of training, so don't think I'm some type of pushover," Ceril eventually said with a smile. And, for a split second, her eyes started to glow red.

There was a rise in Ceril's energy as she said these words, one that was unfamiliar to Mitchell. Naturally, he himself was interested to see what was about to happen.

While the two went off, Logan had finished his daily duties, while he allowed the automated AI system to do its work. Every day, he tried to update the system, but there was something on his mind. If Alex was done with the weapon, then where was he? Had he returned? And had Quinn used his shadow skills to return to the weapon quickly?

With that, Logan had decided to head down to the specially made furnace in his tall tower-like building. A few floors down, Logan entered a certain room, quickly noticing that some of the equipment was still running. After that, he looked around the room, and was unable to see anyone inside. There was no one at all.

Walking around for a bit more, he could see empty vats, knocked over pieces of equipment, and even marks in the ground. It was as if a fight had taken place.

'Was there a fight in here? Surely, that can't be.'

Eventually, he noticed two glowing substances off in the distance. Heading towards them, Logan looked over at the moulds and sensed the energy pulsating from them. With that, Logan could tell that these were the new weapons, the weapons made with Celestial blood and Demon tier crystal. It was complete.

"But what happened to Alex? System, show me the CCTV recordings in the room," Logan ordered. Soon, a screen appeared before him, showing the last moments of Alex Way.

# Chapter 1929 The Messenger Has A Message

While inside, travelling along with Andy and Minny, Quinn was watching several videos that had come out, updating himself on what was going on around the world and how the world had learnt of these Celestials in the first place.

Because of this—just like Andy had said—all the reports of the Hero Quinn's return and the rumours that were spread by those from the vampire corps had somewhat been dismissed. Fear equals bad news. Disasters have always outshined good news at all times. And in the first place, most people just disregarded the articles upon seeing them, assuming them to be attention-grabbing clickbait headlines.

'I don't know whether this is a good thing or not. I was somewhat relieved by the fact that everyone knew about my return, but I guess there were bigger problems. Still, I need to focus more on the current problem, which is Erin.'

'She is definitely planning something, and if the Red Heart can really be used as Logan told me, then it can cause even bigger troubles down the road. After that, maybe I can try searching for Bliss and ask her why these Celestials are even attacking in the first place. It would be best if we can prevent an attack as much as possible.'

Turning off the videos, Quinn looked ahead and saw that Minny and Andy were currently in the middle of an arm wrestle match. All they could do for now was wait on the ship as they travelled to the location of Fex's Burial, which according to Andy, had been changed since last time.

He seemed to be somewhat worried after learning that all the other tombs of the vampire originals and the other vampires were stolen. Thinking that the same might happen to his father after the location was revealed, he was being cautious.

Either way, Minny was looking at Andy and could tell that he had great strength as he was doing many things around the ship with ease, and when Minny attempted to do them she struggled somewhat at times.. After all, he was an advanced type of subclass who focused mainly on strength. Minny had learnt that she herself was strong, which was why she had decided to challenge the others to an arm wrestle.

At first, Andy felt like it was cute. For one, he was going to just let her be for a while and then let her win, making it seem realistic. At the same time, it reminded him of when he first met Quinn. They also had an arm wrestling match. And if Quinn hadn't used his aura and just used his natural strength, then he would have lost.

When the wrestling match first started, Minny had used a sudden burst of strength and had surprisingly moved Andy's arm slightly to the right, which Andy stopped immediately, but it had taken him by surprise.

"Quinn…did you make this monster?!" Andy turned his head and asked with a smiling face.

"That's so rude!" Minny shouted as she began to summon more aura inside of her. But it wasn't just her vampire aura that she was summoning, her body also started to change, as horns came out of her head as she was starting to use celestial energy. "How can you call such a pretty and cute person a monster!"

Andy thought it was ironic because she was literally turning more so into a monster as she said these words. Despite thinking this, Andy was able to hold out with his strength and maintained his position.

'I heard from the others that Minny is quite skilled and strong, but I'm not really sure why. And even Andy is stronger than most vampires back in the day. It makes me wonder, is it a new generation of vampires of subclasses that just continue to evolve? And what about me? What is my place in all of this at the end?'

Thinking these words, Quinn could see that the arms wrestling match was getting intense between the two, and Minny wasn't going to give up anytime soon. Holding out his hand, Quinn started to concentrate as he sensed the vampire aura in her and started to diminish her powers, including that of her celestial powers, her transformation started to revert, going back to what it was originally, making the aura start dwindling down as well.

'I guess since I don't really fight against vampires as much anymore, so there hasn't been a chance to see how well this works against other vampires…The war on vampires, the war on the Dalki ended, and now… the one against the Dhampir is left.'

After Quinn had done his little trick, Andy saw it as an opportunity to end the match without hurting the little one's feelings and placed her hand with great control, stopping it just as it touched the table.

"That's not fair!" Minny shouted. "Daddy interfered! Why did you do that? I was going to win. Don't you love me?!" Minny started doing her best to get tears to come out of her eyes. However, nothing was coming out, and it wasn't working with Quinn.

"Minny, you know I care about you, I just didn't want you two destroying our ship, and besides, you should save your energy. You never know what is going to—" Quinn stopped there, his eyes widened. And the next second, he ran across the room, his hand was enhanced in shadow as he reached out.

The shadow was more of a solid form compared to what it was before and had wrapped around Minny as he pulled her closer towards him, bringing her to his chest. Utilising the shadow in this way was somewhat of a first for Quinn in a while.

His shadow control and condensing of the shadow had never been that great, only allowing him to lift a few items but not use this well in battle. However, he was improving his shadow ability a bit by bit when training with it against Sil. There were still a few things Quinn was improving on after his fight against Chris.

As for why he had used it now, it was due to an intruder who was onboard the ship.

Andy noticed the intruder quickly, too and immediately threw a fist full of strength to hit them.

'If anyone is on board this place in secret, then it can't be someone friendly!' Andy thought. As he threw it out at full strength, his fist stopped.

Well, technically, that wouldn't be accurate to describe the situation.

When Quinn looked at the scene in front of him, it wasn't that Andy's fist had stopped. Everything had stopped. His heartbeat, his breathing. It was as if time had stopped around them. But Quinn and Minny—who was touching him—could move just fine.

Quinn took a look at the sudden intruder. The person was black-skinned, tall and lean. He had a rectangular mouth with razor-sharp teeth as it slowly breathed in and out. Then there were his four pairs of eyes on his rectangular-shaped long head.

'This isn't a human….and the energy… he's another Celestial! What are they doing? They keep interfering and coming here and annoying me. Maybe I really should go to Celestial space again!'

However, after calming down, Quinn started assessing the situation. Right now, it was as if they were in a celestial space. That was why Andy was unable to move. But it was different because he could still see everything around them.

Thinking about this, Quinn believed that this one wasn't any ordinary celestial, and it was best to first understand the whole situation before striking.

"I have been wanting to meet you for quite some time, BB," The figure politely said as he placed a hand on his chest, "There is no need to be alarmed, I am not here to fight you or cause you any trouble. My name is Mundus, and I am known as the messenger of the celestial world, and I am the one that works directly under the Ancient ones.

"I have come to make a proposal to you and hope that we can strike a deal," Mundus smiled, showing a long line of razor-sharp teeth.
