# Chapter 1560 - 100 Percent Sync

When fighting, Quinn realised something. For one, he wasn't the best when it came to using Arthur's sword, nor was he as creative as him when using all the other family abilities, and even if he was, Graham was just too fast and skilled for them to work on him well.

In the first place, the sword had already been punched away and was far on the ground somewhere. If Quinn attempted to go after it, there was a good chance he would create an opportunity for Graham to injure him when he needed to avoid as many hits as possible.

'The good thing is, although I could still feel pain, while I have the shadow body, I can take a few hits head-on. But my blood powers and strength are less than his, which means I will have to use every skill I have to beat him.'

Before moving forward, Quinn summoned countless shadows which appeared all around Graham's position. With the twin tail weapons, Quinn started to swing them as swiftly as possible.

Countless slashes of red aura went through the shadow portals and went towards Graham, but he looked unafraid as he decided to run straight towards Quinn. While running, the red blood aura hit him all over, but it seemed to do nothing to his skin, only ripping his clothes at most to reveal more of his hard skin underneath.

Suddenly, Graham boosted himself a little, kicking the ground and raising it beneath him. It blocked a lot of the attacks, and in an instant, he was right in front of Quinn, ready to deliver another punch.

The viewers heard a loud bang as Graham's fist went right through Quinn's head, and then another bang was heard when this punch also reached its target, exploding and destroying everything in sight. Each punch was a deadly blow.

It was clear Graham had the power to destroy castles, Shelters, and everything in a single punch. Watching it all, it was no wonder that even though there were no more Dalki's, he was still confident that he could finish off the rest of the humans, and this monster of a fight proved that he was right.

The thing was, the body that he had just hit was nothing but a bunch of shadows, as they slowly began to disappear, but the rest of it also wrapped around Graham, almost holding him in place.

Before he could react, both of the twin tails smashed into Graham from the side. His whole body was dragged to the side and flung back into the settlement walls, crashing through it.

The others were glad they had cleared the area; otherwise, at least a few of them would have died just in this exchange. Still, Graham looked unhurt, even by this attack, and his hand was held firmly onto the twin blades, not even causing a scratch on his hard scales.

Pulling on the twin tails, Graham dragged Quinn across the ground, sending him coming towards him mid-air, but while mid-air, Quinn quickly placed the twin tails away, making them disappear and then summoned them back in the next instant.

'I need more power!' Quinn thought as he swung both of them as hard as he could from above, pushing the power of his Qi to the limit.

Raising his hands, Graham stopped the twin tails but was pushed deep into the ground, creating spider-web-like cracks on the surface beneath his feet.

"I see why the others lost to you, you're skilful, and you have so many tricks up your sleeve, but still, you haven't succeeded in even injuring me, not even a scratch!"

Seeing how the soul weapons weren't working, Quinn placed them away again and landed on the ground charging forward. However, this time, the shadows forming the wings on his back moved and began to condense down into something else.

Quinn had seen Arthur do this, making his special condensed shadow shield, but Quinn decided to do something else instead. As it enveloped his left hand, soon, his entire arm was covered in the shadow, flickering ever so slightly.

He already knew that his current blood gauntlet wasn't best used in this situation, so he decided to cover this one in shadows. Meanwhile, on his other arm, Quinn was gathering blood, not just now but during the previous exchanges as well. He had been gathering the blood of the Dalki and the vampires and had wrapped it around his arm once more, and it had slowly hardened over his other gauntlet.

Now, the blood around it started to spin once more, and the Qi, along with the blood, was revolving. One arm with an energy drain gauntlet was a Qi infused blood drill, while the other gauntlet had the shadow condensed over it.

Once again, confident in his strength, Graham didn't worry about this and threw his punch towards Quinn, aiming to get rid of him.

"I'm sure this is your real body this time...so it doesn't matter what game you are up to!" Graham shouted.

Instead of throwing his blood drill hand forward, Quinn opened his hand and grabbed Graham's fist with the condensed shadow instead. It came to a complete stop as if the energy was no longer there.

"Now I have you held in place," Quinn said as he stomped his foot on the ground and threw his right arm from down below, aiming right for Graham's stomach.

'His attack...it's stronger than it was before.' Graham realised because, for the first time, a trickle of green blood dripped down the side of his mouth. He threw another punch with his other arm, but Quinn quickly used his shadow hand to grab it once again and delivered another punch with his right hand, this time at his elbow, aiming to break Graham's arm.

It did nothing, but Quinn could move again and continued to use his shadow arm once again, blocking and striking like this. The shadow hand had become Quinn's trump card since it could block any attack, and slowly bit by bit Quinn's punches were getting stronger.

The problem was, the more Graham received damage, the faster he became as his speed was constantly improved, and he could soon keep up with Quinn and eventually, after delivering another strong punch and it being blocked by Quinn, something happened.

[Shadow overload has ended]

'Wait, what..that many MC cells....are gone like that... I didn't even fight for too long.'

Quinn realised at that moment just how powerful Graham's punches must have been during the fight because his 100,000 MC cells had gone down to 0.

[Shadow body is no longer activated.]

Quinn knew that the drawback had to be big, but now he had to fight with the only advantage he had, and quickly Quinn started to run back, getting away from Graham as fast as he could.

"Haha...I guess that Shadows can't last forever after all!" Graham said. Instead of a punch, Graham threw out a kick towards Quinn's this time.

[Shadow equip activated]

[Blue Fang set has now been equipped]

'I can't get hit…if I do… I'll die.'

[Full reset activated]

[All active skills and cooldowns have been reset]

Full reset, it was one of the gifts Quinn had received from Richard Eno that would help him in this war, which he had saved precisely for a situation like this. He had already used the blue fang set once, and he knew that with his newfound blood powers, he needed the strength of the blood attacks.

But now he had another thought, what if he could buy time? By time until the sync was complete. With a full reset, Quinn was able to activate the active skill of his armour once again.

[Nitro accelerate]

Dashing away, Quinn easily avoided the blow, but the kick's power caused a large shockwave to hit the settlement wall. It went right through it, crushing it and continuing hitting some of the other castles causing them to fall to the ground.

Still, with Quinn's current speed, he was faster than Graham. Suddenly, the fight had become a type of chase. Quinn continuously waited for Graham to attack him while running and avoiding the strike repeatedly.

"What are you doing? You think you can win like this!" Graham shouted at the top of his lungs and got frustrated as he wildly threw punches, destroying the whole area. Nothing could have survived the torn-up battlefield around them.

Until eventually.

[99 percent of the system has been synced]

'Just a little more.'

"Guys! We have to go out there!" Sil shouted out the rest of them. "We have to save Quinn... he's in trouble!"

Vorden looked at Sil and realised that he must have still had the foresight ability activated and could see something disastrous was about to happen.

Out on the field, Quinn's Nitro accelerate was still active, and it looked like his system would come through for him. Running away and heading a great distance away from Graham, Quinn was ready.

'I can feel it. My body, it's gotten stronger...I should be able to do something against him now!' Quinn thought.

*****

# Chapter 1561 - Once In A Full Moon

To reach the level beyond that of a vampire lord. This was a quest that Quinn had for a while now, and he always wondered what were the requirements to complete this quest. Was it increasing his levels, by increasing his blood aura or by gaining more Qi?

In a way, whenever he improved any of these things, it seemed like it would push him forward, but he felt as if he was missing something. However, not knowing what that something was, Quinn had no choice but to put it at the back of his mind.

When fighting against Graham, Quinn could feel this rise in power as the Nest Crystal synced with his body. Ever since absorbing the Blood crystal throne in the fourteenth castle, Quinn had more blood aura than his Qi.

There was an imbalance in power inside him. Mixing both of the powers and balancing was how Quinn could produce the strongest attack possible. However, since one power was more significant than the other, it was almost as if he would have to hold himself back.

He had three choices: Using an attack with just Qi or using an attack with just blood aura, or lessening the two to combine a strike that wouldn't quite be at its full potential but would have the advantages of one or the other.

As the sync rate went up, Quinn could feel that his energy, the Qi in his body flowing through him, was reaching the same amount as the blood aura. What was even better was when absorbing the nest crystal and all the pain he had gone through, it had changed his body and somewhat almost upgraded it to the point where now he could handle more Qi in his body.

This was why he could now use the Demon tier gauntlet to absorb even more energy into himself. Obviously, if he got stronger as the sync rate went up, the best thing to do would be to wait for the sync rate to increase, so Quinn had a higher chance of winning this fight.

What he didn't expect was to suddenly evolve in the middle of a fight. With each evolution Quinn went through, his body suffered extreme pain, and the process would take some time. In simple words, right now, he was vulnerable.

His body was changing whether he wanted to or not, and Quinn had fallen to one knee. There was quite a distance away from Graham as Quinn had used his Blue fang set to get as far away as possible.

'Damn it...I really…I really can't fight this.' Quinn thought as the veins on his neck started to bulge, even being on one knee was painful. Lately, he had been through a lot of changes. Since he had absorbed the nest crystal, he thought it would be the end of his painful days, and he could handle anything.

'How wrong I was about that..this thing hurts even more!' Quinn thought, making a fist and eventually collapsing on the ground completely.

Graham, watching this, just didn't understand what was happening at all.

'Did my attacks actually get through, and he is only feeling the effects now? Or is this a trap?' Graham thought. 'No, this is something else.'

Not wanting to take any chances, Graham continued to charge ahead. It was time for him to end the fight.

'Damn it; I can't move...after waiting this whole time, after letting everyone down, is this really how I'm going to go?!' Quinn thought.

"Quinn!" A lighting strike crashed right in front of Quinn, and the next second, a man in white robes had appeared. "You saved my life; it's now our turn to save yours."

'Our?' Quinn frowned and looked around, only to see that it wasn't just Owen that arrived. The rest of the cursed faction leaders were here as well. And along with them were Mona, Samantha and the remaining vampire leaders.

'No, what are you guys doing?' Quinn couldn't speak, so he could only speak in his head. 'He..will kill you all, he's too strong.'

"Quinn..we aren't as weak as you think," Owen said as if he could read his thoughts. "Genbu, I summon you."

Lighting up from his hand, the familiar turtle appeared and immediately showed its back.

"That won't be enough!" Sil stated as he placed his hands on the ground, and a slight shine was seen for a second before becoming completely invisible. Graham soon felt his body crashing into something, and it turned out that Sil had put up a barrier.

Still, Graham was strong enough to go through the barrier, but Sil's powers slowed him down significantly. But when Graham reached Genbu, he clenched his fists and threw out a punch on the latter's shell.

Purple sparks started to flicker, but the shell was beginning to crack. While still for a moment, though, three sets of red blood strings began to coil around Graham from behind. Standing there was the thirteenth family vampire leader, Lee, with Silver and Fex, who were doing their best to pull Graham's arm and force him back.

Still, even with this, the shell soon was cracking and completely shattered, making Genbu disappear back to the familiar world. It would take time before he could be summoned again for help.

As Genbu disappeared, Graham punched again, expecting to hit Owen, but there was Nate with his demon tier shield, to his surprise.

The momentum of the punch was already moving forward, so Graham was unable to pull back, and his fist landed right in the middle of the shield.

Nate felt like he could feel a slight jolt hitting his body, even though he had the shield. This was something he had never felt before, but thankfully everyone's efforts in slowing Graham down so far had worked, and of course, it was Sil who had come up with this plan.

The demon tier shield lit up, and everyone got out of the way as they imagined the big explosion would go off around the shield. And that was what exactly happened as a blue energy, larger than any other, shot off from the shield and there were those that stood behind Nate for support so he could hold the shield properly, the Blade family, Linda and Smantha in their transformed state.

The explosions being delivered from the shield were larger than a mountain. One couldn't see the other side opposite the settlement because it was covered in blue energy. All the flowers on the ground were destroyed, crumbled and turned into nothing as eventually, the blue light lit up.

The group holding onto the shield were being pushed back even more but then…

When it disappeared, they looked in front of them and could see nothing. Graham wasn't in front of them at all.

The others were suspicious; Layla had her sword out, Dennis and the others drew their weapons and had their abilities active as well. Peter, with his lesser wights, and Borden, with his claws, were ready to charge in...they just couldn't believe it was that easy to kill Graham.

However, the demon tier shield was meant to produce twice the attack power of its opponent back at them. If there was any item that was perfect for who they were going up against, it was this one.

"Is it over?" Vorden asked.

"I can't see," Sil said, rubbing his eyes, looking tired. "I already used up too much of my powers when going up against the dragon... I've run out of MC cells."

"He's not dead… he's definitely not dead," Raten said.

Moments later, they saw a Dalki in the distance. He no longer had any clothes on his body because they were burned away by the explosion. He slowly walked over to the others, and now they could tell he was hurt.

His body was wounded, and green blood oozed from certain parts of his body. Which wasn't a good sign with a Dalki.

"I never thought…after becoming a seven spike I would get hurt by you people, but luckily, I always take precautions.

"There was a reason why I was a little late," Graham said as he looked up at the sky. "There is something I can do only once a month, and this was the perfect moment. I could kill you all slowly but why bother with that."

Hearing these words, Nate and Sil remembered.

It was then that Graham's muscles started to bulge, and fur began to appear through his body out from on top of his scales, his face was enlarging into a type of a snout and his nostrils were growing bigger as well.

"What..is happening to him?" Layla asked.

"Graham is transforming." Logan replied remembering the files.

*****

# Chapter 1562 - Unstoppable Force

Looking through the information in his head, Logan went through the data he had gathered from Richard Eno. When creating the Dalki, they used all sorts of DNA gathered from humans.

It was essential to use DNA human's as the basis because they were trying to create a human blood substitute. After all, the vampires were unable to drink beast or vampire blood, which was why Logan found the fact that what Graham was turning into right now was incredibly strange.

Graham was growing in size, and the dragon-like features on his body were changing. Already nearing eight-foot-tall, he was now around ten feet. On his back, where his spikes would stick out from, a trail of fur had come out along till the tip of his tail.

His hands were becoming less like a dragon but still similar to a dangerous beast as his fingers imitated more human claw-like hands. His face had come out more forward like a type of snout on a dog or a wolf, and fur wasn't just present on his back, but black fur also covered his forearms and more.

While the changes in his body were occuring a strange pulse of energy was being emptied outwards. It was so strong that the ground beneath was being cracked a bit more with each energy pulse.

It was a telling sign and perhaps unlike Quinn, it was a way to stop the others from attacking while his body was changing.

"This…this is what he was turning into last time! This is how he killed Helen." Nate said, shaking with fear. The others wanted to move, thinking that maybe attacking while it was turning was the best idea, but it really didn't seem like it would be the case.

If Graham was dangerous before, he was a complete monster right now. Far stronger than any demon tier beast or a Dalki they had faced before.

"What is going on right now?!" Jin shouted. "Leaders, I need an answer!" Jim shouted out to the others behind him.

Jin wasn't the only one shaken up by this; all of their eyes widened as they stood frozen on the spot, stunned. Finally, Vincent spoke.

"I know what you're thinking…but I have no clue why Dalki has the features of a Werewolf."

Hearing the words from Vincent had made many of the vampires shiver hearing that word, but out of all the vampires that were currently present, many of them weren't alive when the existence of Werewolves was known. They knew of Werewolves but hadn't seen one before.

"Vincent, just how bad is this?" Sam asked.

"Everyone!" Vincent shouted in response to that question. "Some of you may have never faced a Werewolf before, but I'm sure you know, and if you don't, I will state this as a reminder: If its claws or teeth scratch you, you will not be able to heal.

"Even with the use of blood! I don't know if it will be the same for the Dalki in front of us, but everyone should treat it like so. Only the second leader, Katori, can heal you if you are hurt, so we must keep her alive at all costs."

"Unable to heal? For some reason, I don't think that's going to be a f*cking problem when he can destroy a whole castle with a single punch!" Raten shouted back.

"Logan, Linda, Dennis, we will stay back and look after Quinn. We will move him and try to find out what's wrong with him. Leave the fight up to the others!" Sam ordered.

"Samantha, you go with them as well!" Fex added.

She wanted to argue back but chose not to. Those whose names had been called felt a little bad because they knew why they were being told to stay back.

It was just another way of telling them that they were useless in the upcoming fight.

Picking Quinn up, they quickly moved him and headed towards the ruins of the settlement.

Around six of the vampire leaders now moved and formed an arrow formation and looked towards Graham. They didn't need to know he was done with his transformation because his eyes told them all.

Now they were glowing yellow, and the next second he howled, shaking the whole world around them. Graham was a few hundred metres away, and yet his howl shook the hair on their heads and even ruffled their clothes. It was just too powerful.

"We can't wait any longer; fight back!" Vincent ordered, and three groups of forces charged towards Graham.

Everything was still currently being broadcasted live, and the situation was so tense that Bonny had stopped reporting. The comment section was primarily silent as they watched this nail-biting moment.

They could see that the group was charging forward in three separate forces.

On the left side, there were the Blades, consisting of Raten, Sil, Vorden and Borden, who was now a five spiked Dalki. The second attack force consisted of the vampire forces consisting of Vincent, Jin, Katori, Jake, Lee, Dillan, Silver and Fex.

Finally, there was the mixed group of Layla, Peter, Nate, Owen and Mona. None of them really had a plan for how they were going to approach this.

The vampires were the most forward of the groups, and quickly just like before, Lee jumped to one side, throwing out his red string wrapping it around one of the arms. At the same time, Fex and Silver went to the other side, wrapping the string around the other arm.

With all their strength, they pulled, trying to stop Graham from attacking them. Then charging at the front was Dillan, who wore a cape and could harden any material he touched and change its shape and form.

"Idiots!" Graham snarled through his mouth.

He moved his hand aimlessly, but it was so fast the others couldn't see what happened, but suddenly flying through the air were three arms. With a little pull, Graham had ripped them off the string still attached. It was almost as if there was no resistance at all, and now all of those in the thirteenth family were bleeding from their side.

The next second, Graham swiped his hand not even close to Dillan. Having a bad feeling, he lifted his cap to protect himself. Still, his ability and powers were useless as the force of attack through the wind encased his cape and cut through his whole body diagonally, which fell on the ground after getting cut into five different parts.

A vampire leader was killed just like that from a single swipe of Graham's hand.

"Don't falter!" Vincent shouted as he sped up ahead of everyone running in quicker than the others upon seeing that there was an opening after the attack, but he wasn't alone; two more were by his side in the attack as well.

A lightning bolt, Vincent's fist and Peter's hands that were glowing proceeded to whack Graham right in the stomach, all at the same time using as much power as they could the strong force crashed into the same place.

Graham's body didn't even move with the three attacks, and the others were unsure if they had even scratched him.

"You…why do you look like that boy," Graham said, smiling at Vincent. It looked like Graham was about to make another attack, but before he could, a mud-like substance had landed on his arm, freezing him for a moment. The group of attackers split in a moment as they fell back, and now Peter's wights had come forward instead to make sure Graham couldn't chase after them.

Still, the mud seemed to have done nothing, as Graham swung his arm, towards the Leg's tail that was coming at him, and for the first time ever, Peter had seen something that was sharper than Slicers tail, because just like with the leader before, Graham sliced the tail into five parts and before anyone could react, he once again swung his other hand, and Legs was gone.

Raten and Vorden were frozen about what to do next, and so were the rest of the vampires. They didn't have time to think, though, because now they only had time to react.

"It's my turn." Graham smiled.

He rushed forward towards the headless Hilston and clawed at its body two times. His hands sliced right through the bodies, and just like Legs, there was no coming back from that. The claws had ripped through the armour as if it was nothing, and now everyone could tell no matter what, if those claws attacked them, nothing could save them.

Next, Graham leapt up in the air as the others couldn't help but wonder about who he was aiming for.

"I won't let you try anything either!" Graham said as he had grabbed onto Vorden, who was up above. He held onto his wings, and Graham's weight made them both come crashing down to the ground, breaking the area beneath him as he fell.

The next second digging his nails into the hard Demon tier wings, Graham pulled and ripped them off from Vorden's body, causing black blood to spill everywhere.

"Get off from my brother!" Borden shouted and rushed forward. The anger filled him, but before he could even get close to Graham, he lifted his foot up and kicked him away. Borden felt his chest crushing in on him, and his body sent flying back way off in the distance where no one could see him.

'We…we..can't win.'

These were the only words that came out of Nate's mouth as he loosely held the shield.

"No! No!" Layal shouted. "We took out the dragon! He's the only one left who we need to take out!"

Layla had transformed into her true Hannya form, and without hesitating any bit, she activated her sword as the symbol lit up.

Jin and the other vampire leaders were using all of their blood powers and abilities they could towards Graham, but none seemed to be able to get through his scales or hide. Still, it was a distraction nonetheless as Layla charged forward.

"You said you could cut through anything, so then cut through him and kill him!" Layla screamed as she swung her sword down. She soon heard the sound of nothing and felt her sword hit nothing but air.

"You're sh*t with that sword!" Graham said as he easily dodged the sword attack and swung his hand down, ready to reach her face, until everyone heard a loud crash and something knocked his hand to the side. For a second, Graham's hand started to freeze, and because of this, he leapt back, away from the danger.

Layla couldn't believe her eyes.

"Erin…you're finally back."

However, Nate seeing the new arrival didn't know if this was a good thing at all, remembering what had happened last time.

*****

# Chapter 1563 - Losing Everyone

Two people, Nate and Owen, who were currently present on the battlefield, had seen this type of scene once before when the group was in a desperate situation, when they felt like they were on their last legs.

"Layla, get away from her!" Nate shouted.

An emotion of joy had come over Layla when seeing Erin, one that she hadn't felt in a while since the last time she saw her long lost friend. She had completely forgotten about the details that Nate had told everyone.

'No, she wouldn't hurt me, right? She just stopped Graham's attack.' Layla thought.

Due to the sudden attack, Graham jumped back after seeing the strike on his hand turn it to ice. It was then, at that moment, hoping to stop him from following up with an attack, Erin threw her sword into the ground.

She triggered the third active skill the next second and constructed a giant ice wall between them. Usually the wall of ice was used to reflect attacks similar to how Nate's shield did, but she was now using it more as a barrier.

After an instant, she turned to look towards Layla, making the latter's body flinch because she could see Erin's glowing eyes. They were fierce, and for some reason, these eyes terrified Layla. The fear enveloped her body, freezing on the spot.

'No.. has she..has she really gone over to the other side?'

As fear took over Layla, she felt a strong urge to activate the sword, which was something she would feel only in dangerous situations, and right now, as she stared at Erin, the sense of danger kept on increasing.

The symbol on the sword began to glow, and the strange voices that would give her a different emotion, but one she was more used to, ran through her head, immediately she felt like she could move once again as she gripped the sword tightly in her hand.

"I am not the one…" Erin paused for a second as if she was taking a deep breath, "That you should be fighting."

The ice barrier soon went down, and Graham was standing on the other side. The group somehow managed to reorganise themselves for a second but now would have to face the monster known as Graham once more.

At the moment, Vorden was getting healed from Katori. He was the only one who had sustained injuries that she could heal. Because Dillan had died from the single attack by getting sliced into pieces, Katori couldn't heal her.

In the meantime, Sil stood at the end of the group because he was trying his best to recover his MC cells. Once he recovered, he could use his soul weapon to change the abilities he wanted as he wished. Switching between these abilities could also increase his MC cells, but they wouldn't restore what he had used.

Since he had already selected some of the strongest abilities when going up against the dragon, his MC cells were already as high as they could be. Using his powers had drained him then, so it made no difference selecting new abilities.

Right now, all he could do was wait.

The first one to act was Erin, as she twisted the grip on her sword, making the blade turn a slight red. She swung down her sword, creating a tunnel of fire on the side of Graham. This blocked him from going after Katori and those around her.

Quickly twisting the sword again, it now changed once more, and Erin rushed forward, fearlessly, to face off her opponent. Layla was about to go on after her, but she noticed that Erin was incredibly fast; the second Erin kicked off the ground, she had almost reached Graham.

She wasn't quite as fast as Quinn, but her speed was closest to his.

"Your sword…is annoying," Graham frowned. He could still feel the frost on his arm. After all, what Erin was using wasn't just a demon tier weapon; instead, it was a humanoid demon tier weapon.

Graham dug his hands into the ground, cutting through it like butter, and at that moment, he also charged forward. The next second with a large slash, five giant holes ran deep into the ground as a fissure appeared.

Each strike on the ground was large enough to cause one to fall through the hole. Jumping up, Erin tried her best to avoid falling into the hole, but that's when she noticed that Graham had leapt up after her as well.

Pointing her sword towards Graham, she activated her first skill and an ice tunnel shot out from her sword. Swinging his arms and slashing through the air, Graham had sent out an attack. As soon as the ripples that were cut through the air had reached the ice tunnel, it broke through it completely, not even holding for a second.

The attack continued towards Erin, and it looked like it was about to hit her.

'The ice tunnel lost out…just how strong is this Dalki.' Erin thought. Her ice tunnel had only lost out to one person in the past, and that was Laxmus when he used the blood beam attack, and now for the second time, her tunnel had failed her.

Erin lifted her sword, hoping to block the attack, but seeing this, Layla got worried that the former's sword wouldn't be enough to stop the attack.

However, Peter had chucked Nate up from the ground, and the latter held out the Demon tier shield in between Erin and Graham. The strike hit the shield and absorbed the energy. The two soon fell to the ground, and the shield was lighting up with power once again.

'The shield...it worked. I was worried that Graham's power would be too strong for it.' Nate thought maybe the ice tunnel had weakened Graham's attack's power a little.

On the ground where Graham was about to land, both Vincent and Peter were right on the spot to hold him back, but the second the former landed, he charged forward across the field and reached out for the shield in Nate's hands.

His large hands gripped the entire shield.

"This is annoying," Graham said, as he used all the strength in his claw at the shield. The next second, the shield was being sliced from all five directions, and as it got destroyed, the blue glow on it began to fade away.

Eventually, Graham had managed to close his hands, and the demon tier shield that so far had been able to withstand every attack was crushed.

"Crap!" Nate managed to say, as he was looking to get out of there, Erin ran around Nate and with her sword was planning to attack, but before she could even swing her sword fast enough, Graham opened his mouth wide and bit off Nate's head, separating it from the rest of the body.

With a fling of its arm, he knocked Erin away into the far off distance as the rest of Nate's body fell to the floor.

"NOOOO!" Layla screamed at the top of her lungs, and many others felt their heart drop. Vincent and Peter had also caught up, and they grabbed the back of Graham's head. Clenching their fists, they punched Graham as many times as they could, but he soon grabbed both of them from behind and slammed them into the ground, causing them both to spit out blood.

"Bring him back!" Layla shouted as she swung the sword again, but once more, Graham stepped back and moved far away, too fast for any of them to keep up.

But this time, he had someone in his hands, and it was Mona. She knew when Graham was aiming to grab her; she could see his movements from the countless battles she had, but...this battle was far above her abilities.

"Don't worry about me…just kill this basta-" Mona managed to say before her head too was bitten off by Graham, and as he gulped down, with a trail of blood sliding from the corner of his mouth, he howled.

"Layla, listen to me…allow me to help you so we can take that thing down together!" Lee shouted as he threw needles into her back, and his hands now controlled her body. For some reason, Lee noticed that Graham avoided the sword even after his latest transformation. In simple words, the sword was the only way right now which had the highest possibility to hold him back.

"Another one!" Quinn grunted through the pain. "HE KILLED ANOTHER ONE!" Quinn's face was boiling with anger as veins popped on his face. It was the first time that Sam had ever seen him like this, but Quinn's evolution wasn't complete yet, which meant quite possibly he was going to lose a few more of his friends, if not all.

# Chapter 1564 - One By One

The vampire settlement had their own fleet of ships and different types. They often used them to explore the planets in their solar system and in case there were other needs. However, the spaceships were never meant to be used in a war.

The vampires never planned a full-scale evacuation because the settlement was their safe haven. If all of the vampires were to up and leave at once, then there wouldn't even be enough space for all of them.

Thankfully though, there was enough room for them. The vampires might have found the ships cramped for them, but they realised that there was space for them, and that was because a lot of the vampires were dead. Those vampires had gone to the war and sacrificed themselves, while many died due to the infighting from before.

At the moment, the person in charge of the evacuation of the vampires was the Royal Knight Muka. Along with all the other ships, she wasn't too far away from the planet and was still watching with everyone as they waited for the result on the screen.

"Why aren't you helping our king?" Since becoming a Royal knight, Muka didn't stay around her family for long, but now she was once again standing amongst them.

She took out a coin and spun it, waiting for it to settle, it landed on tails.

"You know, when we explain our families abilities to others, we often explain it as luck, but that's just the simplest form of our ability. The truth is that it more equates to timing, which is why I have everyone in the family carry a totem with them.

"Something they can use to know whether luck in the fight is on their side or not. Our will doesn't even activate our ability; rather, it has its own will. However, lately, I feel like our ability is closer to foresight than anything." Muka began to explain. "Perhaps it helps determine our chances. I spun this coin a hundred times to land on heads and not once has it landed on tails. But this time, I have tossed it for the 101st time. This battle, if we join, we will die."

Of course, the vampires weren't the only ones watching the Livestream, and after seeing Graham transform and what he had done to everyone so far, there seemed to be anger amongst the viewers.

"What is Quinn doing? What are the vampire leaders doing! Some of them are just standing around there! Aren't they supposed to be the strongest?!"

"That's Oscar's sword as well, but the attack from that Dalki's claws still beat the power of the weapon."

"That's a demon tier weapon as well, so I don't think we could be doing better."

"I'm not saying that we can do better, but if these guys don't get their act together, we're going to lose. Quinn needs to join the fight as well. What is he doing?!"

"I agree; why the hell did he suddenly fall? He should have been prepared!"

Soon the comment section continued to blame a certain individual, the vampire king and leader of the Cursed faction, Quinn. They were blaming him for what looked a failure in defeating this one Dalki.

The Dalki who could easily wipe all of them out.

"Are you reading all of this?" Void said as the hate continued to pour in.

Of course, Bony was seeing everything. They always had a separate computer that would scroll through the comments to see what people were thinking and the general reaction of viewers.

"SHUT UP!" Bonny eventually shouted, which was also played in the live stream. "You hate Quinn, then you rely on him, and now you hate him because you relied on him. I understand you are not angry; you are just all reacting with anger right now.

"The reason why you guys are angry is that you're scared...and right now, the only one you think that can actually help us is Quinn. If that's that, then don't take your anger out on him, but show support!"

"Screw you, we all know you were getting D from him. You think we didn't know?"

"Oh yeah, she kissed him right and has always been right up his arse."

"Saying we're scared? We're just saying that if we were in the same position as them, we had the same power as them, we wouldn't have f*cked up this whole situation so badly. The most useless person in the world happened to get all this power and doesn't know what to do with it."

Despite what Bonny had just said, it seemed to backfire the whole situation. It was very easy to criticise when one wasn't in the driver's seat, and this situation couldn't be a better proof of it.

"Just carry on filming everything, Void, make sure they see the faces of the ones that fought for this damned world. They don't even care that people have died from them." Bonny ordered.

———

After seeing what had happened to the others so far, no one exactly was charging in on their own towards Graham. Peter and Vincent seemed to be quite hurt, but others couldn't help them because it was clear Graham was using the two as bait and would go after them next as his target.

No longer were they trying to stop Graham, but it felt like they didn't want to be next. That was until Layla's body was attached by the set of strings that Lee controlled.

'Wait, this might actually be able to work.' Layla thought.

Layla's swordsmanship skills weren't the best, and the thirteenth family's true ability came when puppeteering. When activating the sword, the voices distracted her somewhat, and she knew that she wouldn't be able to use the sword's full power for a long time.

'But now with someone controlling me…I can let the powers of the sword take over!' She thought.

The next second, the marking on the sword started to glow in and out. Layla began to scream as if she had gone mad on the spot.

"Don't worry about me!" She somehow managed to shout through her teeth.

In doing so, Lee started to run forward while also being not too far behind her, controlling the set of strings. Graham, seeing someone had dared to come forward, did what he was doing so far and swung his arms out, creating a set of deadly air ripples using his claws that could seemingly cut through anything.

However, at the right time, in a smooth motion and control, Layla's black sword moved in a complete circle and in doing so, it met the claw-strike head-on at each time. When it did, the claw ripples that would go travel the air, cutting through everything, slowly dissipated.

"I could tell there was something strange about that sword," Graham said as he saw this. Honestly, even Lee was surprised by the result. It was far better than he was expecting, and it allowed them all to charge in.

With Layla close, Lee swung the blade in beautiful motions thrusting forward and back, but Graham dodged all the strikes.

Graham was large but fast in this form, but he had a strong intuition that if the sword touched him, even if on his claws, it would cause a problem.

Seeing this, others felt like maybe they should go in and help. Raten, Jin, all of them were trying to wait for the right opportunity, but as they all came in, annoyed Graham lifted his foot and slammed it on the ground, shaking the foundation of the ground itself as the area around them splintered, making Layla stumble on the ground for the next second.

Seeing this, Owen quickly bolted himself over to her position, hoping to protect her, knowing that she might be the best chance at beating Graham. However, Graham ran straight past her. He was never targeting Layla in the first place.

The next second, they all saw Graham's hand go directly through the thirteenth family's leader's chest.

"You think I'm stupid like those other Dalki...it's clear that he is the actual one that caused a problem, and I'm happy to take you down one by one!"

"NOO!" Silver screamed as it looked like she was about to run over, but quickly her body was wrapped around in strings, and she was yanked back.

"Sis, don't kill yourself; trust me, I know how you feel!" Fex shouted as he pulled her to his side. "Trust me; I want to go over there right now! Believe me! I do…but…"

Fex stopped himself right there as his throat was choking up, but then something strange had begun to happen on the battlefield. The sky, the clouds above them, were turning red. The others, upon seeing this, wondered what was happening, but Fex knew.

"He…he's ready now," Fex said.

# Chapter 1565 - The Red Sky

Having to undergo the evolution process right now was akin to torture, in more ways than one. First of all, the level of physical pain Quinn was experiencing was immense. As it drained the Nest Crystal's energy, the vampire felt that his body was on the verge of exploding, only a single tiny step away from his demise.

Nevertheless, Quinn instinctively knew that it was doing so to push his body towards the next stage. Every part of his body, his cells, muscle fibre, bone structure and so on was getting pulled apart and rearranged into a more optimal way. All of it got broken down and rebuilt from the ground up… only to be broken down again for the process to start all over again.

And yet this wasn't the worst part of it. No, while the vampire had to endure this near-death experience, he was forced to watch the Dalki leader wreak havoc on the people on his side. Quinn felt helpless as he felt Graham go on a killing spree.

Then while 'watching' everything going on… Quinn could see that Nate had been killed.

Quinn was steeling his resolve, barely able to reach out his hand in the direction that his friend had just lost his life. He wanted to reach him, even if he had to crawl on the ground, hoping to somehow rescue him.

Alas, his system was unusable at this moment, fully focused on having him evolve, so he wasn't even able to summon anyone by his side. Quinn didn't have a plan whatsoever, his instincts just screamed at him that he had to kill that lizard bastard, no matter what!!!

'You damn shitty familiar, come the f*ck out and make yourself useful!!! You never listen when I really need you! If you're not going to help me now, then leave my freaking body!' Quinn cursed at Bone Claw. The familiar would often come out when he was angry, but now that his negative feelings had reached a peak, it stayed silent. The evolving vampire didn't think it could actually do something against the Dalki, but he might buy them some time, even if only for a second.

"ARGHHHH!" Quinn grunted through the pain. Even in the state he was in, he somehow managed to shed tears. If he could see himself, he would have noticed those were tears of blood, which quickly dissipated as his evolution continued.

At the same time, Sam who had stayed by Quinn's side and had been watching over him this whole time fell to his knees. As the one who had turned him, the young man felt it more than any other when his life had been extinguished.

"He…Nate…Quinn …did Nate ... just ... no…no ... " Sam couldn't even speak properly, unable to accept what had just happened to his dear friend.

Despite being a talented high level user, he had stuck around Sam and had helped him no matter what troubles the latter had found himself in. The two should have never been a match in normal circumstances, but that was just who Nate had been. Someone who hadn't had a bad bone in his body.

"I should have told him to come back… I should have told him to come back with us!" Sam clenched his fists in anger and despair.

For Quinn, it was a hard loss as well. Nate had been there close to the start of Quinn's journey. Someone who he had coincidentally met during the VR game. A special person who had just wanted to improve himself for fun.

And yet, in time they had become good friends, someone that Quinn could rely on, and who had never let him down. Without asking anything in return, he had taught a lot of people in the Cursed faction, earning him their respect. Worst of all, Quinn felt that if Nate had never met him… then perhaps he wouldn't have died today…

The only reason he had joined the Cursed faction was because of Quinn.

Alas, the Cursed faction leader didn't even get much time to grieve over one person, when the Dalki leader had claimed another victim. Mona was the next one to fall. Although not one of the original members of the Cursed faction, the former Big Four leader had helped out humanity more than once.

In a way, she felt like the most selfless person Quinn had ever met. For this reason, he had given her the Demon tier Amulet. It seemed a perfect fit given her own ability. The vampire hadn't even asked for it back, yet Mona had promised him of her own volition to take good care of it and return it.

Now, she wouldn't get the chance to. Off in the distance, as her body fell to the ground, so did the Amulet…he never expected to get it back this way.

Quinn had always known that in this war, it would be impossible to not suffer any casualties. Nevertheless, nothing could prepare one for the loss of life of those close to oneself and if something didn't happen he would lose them all. None of them were a match for Graham who was even stronger now than when Quinn had faced him.

Seeing how things were going, Quinn managed to grab the ground somewhat, and pulled his upper body up off.

"Quinn, what are you doing? Just focus on getting through this!" Sam managed to say as he wiped his face with his sleeve.

"S… A… M!" Quinn blurted out and straight out of his mouth a pile of blood started to fall. It continued to gush out pools of blood. Such a thing to come out, even for a vampire lord, was clearly dangerous. If it was a regular human they perhaps would have been dead.

"B…loo…d." Quinn managed to say. "Blood!"

It was the only word that came out, while the red liquid he seemed to crave still dripped out of his mouth. It was clear that Quinn couldn't speak and get everything out. Touching his side, Sam started to pour blood out from the flask trying to get it to go into the leader's mouth, but something strange happened.

When he tried to pour it, it started to float in the air around the Vampire King. It just stayed there in place, not going down or falling to the ground. Sam then noticed that the same thing was happening to the blood that was on the floor as well.

"Mo….more ... " Quinn managed to grunt out under duress.

"You want more blood? You're going to kill that damn Graham, right?! If that's what you need, I'll get you as much blood as you need!" Sam promised, and got straight to work. "I'll get you all the blood including my own if it's to kill Graham!"

Immediately, the tactician called those that were in the Cursed ship, and told them to come to the Cursed faction planet with all the blood reserves they could get. It was close by, so it wouldn't take long. Since Quinn had told him to gather as many types of blood, Sam had been doing all of that anyway. After that, Sam contacted Muka who was on board the ship.

"I don't care how you do it, get as much blood as you can, whether it's vampire blood, human blood or whatever!" Sam ordered, and it sounded like they were soon to follow. There were no questions asked as they knew it had to be important if it was at a time like this.

There was one more place where there was plenty of blood that they could get. Dennis and the others quickly went with Samantha in search of more blood that would be in the castle. Everyone was quick to work.

Fortunately, many of the vampire ships also had high amounts of human blood on board for all of them to feast on if need be.

"We are ready, do you want us to deliver the blood to you?" Muka asked.

Looking at Quinn, and the fact that the blood wasn't being drunk by him, it was clear that he required it for something else. His hair was starting to grow, but his skin was becoming tighter similar to when he would become a Blood Sucker, but what was the reason?

The answer seemed to be staring at him in the face, as the blood was rising in the air… into the sky.

"Just drop the blood above the castle!" Sam ordered.

As strange as it sounded, now wasn't the time to question orders. Following his instructions, they did as they were told, and the blood was seen falling, only to rise again. All of it looked to be gathering around Quinn's location. At the same time, the others didn't even need to rush to the castle and find the blood because it was already moving on its own.

When it reached the point above Quinn, it started to spread out, and formed clouds above them. Scarlet clouds soon filled the sky, turning the whole battlefield red. Then the Blood armour that was on Quinn's body started to break down. It flew into the sky, the same happened to the Blood gauntlet, leaving him only with his regular energy draining gauntlet.

Now that the others could see his body, they could see that all of Quinn's veins were beaming with bright red energy, too bright to be described as blood. One could see it lighten up, and then darken a little through the skin as Quinn breathed.

His hair had grown to the point that it was running down his back-up to his waist. Then, ultimately, his back could be seen wriggling until snapping out from them and nearly hitting Sam in the face were two large wings. At first there was nothing but bones, but filling up between was the bright red glow that looked to be running through Quinn's body.

Finally, after all that time, Quinn could move as he picked himself up off the ground and stood up. His body looked the same as it did before, yet his face looked a bit older. The face of the young adult had aged, giving him the appearance of an adult, in his early thirties.

The same markings that were on his back were also running through his chest.

Quinn's evolution was complete, and he knew it as well.

[Congratulations, you have successfully evolved]

[Quest: 'Become something beyond a Vampire Lord' has been completed]

[Evolution: Celestial Vampire Lord]

[New title: Ruler of Blood]

# Chapter 1566 - Ruler Of Blood

The drones were struggling to fly properly through the sky. The red clouds above were quite dense, so they moved behind the vampire settlement to film everything clearly, and instead of concentrating on Graham, all cameras were now focused on Quinn.

They witnessed his new form through the camera, and many of them had similar thoughts running through their heads as they saw this.

"That…is not a human... I don't care what you say. That thing is a monster."

"Is this what happens after transforming? what even is that thing...is that what a vampire actually looks like."

"It's so…beautiful...if I become a vampire, will I look like this?"

"Weirdo, take your fetishes somewhere else."

Quinn didn't need the system to tell him his body had evolved. He could feel the strong energy seething inside him, giving him a strange feeling he had never felt before after the many times he had evolved.

This form that he was currently in, its power and strength, were similar to the time when he had borrowed Ray's power for a few moments.

While the system screen was open, Quinn quickly went through the prompts to see if there were any notable changes. The first two were what he had become and his title. However, there seemed to be something up with the system.

The values of his stats, the blood control, and all of his skills appeared blank.

'Can the system not keep up with it, or is it something else?' Quinn thought.

Not even his current level would show, but there were a few things that could still be seen, including the system's quests, the other titles, and what he currently was.

[Celestial Vampire Lord]

'Celestials... aren't they beings from heaven or space. Beings that are above human kind…have I become a…'

'Don't get ahead of yourself, boy.' Ray's voice boomed in his ears, 'You have no clue what you can do, you have no clue if this form is something permanent either, or is it just like when I lent you my power. Those in front of you need you.'

Looking up, Quinn could see that the fighting had stopped, and Graham hadn't attacked any of the others and just continued to look their way. For some reason, noticing the dead bodies on the ground, Quinn wasn't angry.

The energy inside him was keeping him calm, but he still remembered them, remembered the times he spent with them, and still knew what he wanted to do even if the anger from him had escaped.

Jumping from his position, Quinn covered the great distance between the settlement and the battle. It was at least a kilometre away, and just before landing, he flapped his red wings that left particles of red dust each time they moved.

"What…what is that?" Fex couldn't help but mumble and was hoping his sister or Vincent had an answer.

"I..have no idea. I have never seen anything like this in any of the books before." Silver replied. "Even when Laxmus transformed, he looked more like a bloodsucker, whereas Quinn seems more human, or even angelic."

"Everyone, leave this to me. Take the dead bodies away and head back to the settlement." Quinn ordered.

When speaking out loud, even the tone of Quinn's voice had changed, and it was light smooth and gave everyone a strangely calming influence. At first, the others weren't sure if they should move because they were confused if they heard Quinn's voice or someone else's.

Graham was beyond what any of them ever thought he would be, even if Quinn had gotten stronger and evolved. No one knew if the new Quinn was enough to match Graham in strength. The first one to move and follow the order of stepping back was Peter.

He believed in Quinn, and thus he would always follow the latter's orders.

"I know you can beat this damn wolf, and he wouldn't even be able to lay a finger on me if he wanted to," Peter said out loud for the others to hear.

There was another reason why he was so confident. As Quinn got stronger, the connection that Peter would usually feel and grow with him as he grew power was drifting further and further apart from him, but now it was gone entirely.

It was as if Peter could no longer become or reach Quinn's level. Soon after, the rest started to move as well, and strangely Graham didn't say anything or do anything as they picked up the dead and moved away.

Even Silver carefully used her strings, not going too close to retrieving her father's body. The others soon ran back to the settlement and started to see what they could do on those injured.

"You can feel it, right?" Graham eventually spoke after all of them had gone. "You have managed to reach a new realm. You know, I was always searching for something to go beyond the five spiked Dalki, and ever since I got the sixth spike, I realised something.

"I was different from the rest of my race. I could feel something beyond my current realm, but I didn't quite know what it was, and now I am nearly there; I can feel it. Me and you, we are more similar than you think.

"I got stronger, and I am now very close to reaching it: the realm of gods. The powers to control and destroy anything I wish and you, you know, have reached the same realm as me as well, haven't you?"

Quinn was taking in what Graham had said. His eyes wandered around the surroundings and remembered the battle he had witnessed before.

"Me and you, the same? So this is why you continued to attack and hurt humans and vampires? Because you were searching for something beyond what you currently were? You are doing all this just because you can become a god?

"You and I are completely different. I got stronger because I had to; I grew in power to protect those that I care about and change the way people mistreat the weak, and as for you, you are killing those underneath you just because they are weak!

"If you had just tried searching for the Demon tier beast or searching for a way to extend your life, I could understand that, but what you are doing right now...l. So, don't give me that crap that it's in your nature. Borden is one of you as well, and he is with us just fine!

"Now, knowing who you are, I believe just like the humans, there was someone controlling everything—controlling you from when you were created—putting in your mind that humans and the vampires abandoned you. It was instilled in your mind that you needed to be rid of these two races…maybe it was Jim, but he's dead, Graham.

"When you took his place, you could have changed that, but did you?You didn't even care for those that were part of your race. No, you chose to continue focusing on your own goal. You are an existence that needs to be wiped out no matter what."

While Quinn was speaking, the clouds above began to turn dark red in colour, and then the strangest phenomenon started to ensue on the planet. It was raining, but not just any rain; it was raining red droplets of blood.

The clouds poured endless blood down on the entire surface of the planet.

"You can't kill me anymore. You have only just reached my stage now; I am close to the next stage. I can tell that fighting you will only help me evolve into what I wish to become. So if you wish to do that, then so be it." Graham said as he opened his mouth wide and howled straight towards Quinn.

Moving his wings, Quinn covered his body and blocked out the screech coming towards him; what looked like red-coloured energy flew off the wings. Quinn opened his wings up again and was completely fine.

"That is just the power of my shout!" Graham shouted, as if to show his strength.

"Graham, you are wrong about one thing... I am not trying to become a god...right now...I already am one." Quinn replied as his eyes began to glow red, and suddenly the blood rain slowed down and paused on the spot - with droplets still in the air.

*****

# Chapter 1567 - An Ancient Battle

There were multiple solar systems in the vast universe. Yet, for some reason, it was quite difficult for Humans and vampires to find any other race out there that had a significant level of intelligence like themselves.

In fact, nearly every solar system seemed to have something more akin to the beasts that they would find. From those, the only ones that were considered intelligent were the ones that had more of a human appearance.

It begged the question multiple times how exactly did the human race start? Regardless, drifting off into space in a spaceship of their own, they were in an unknown part, but they weren't far enough to not get a signal, and right now, all of them in the spaceship were watching the current battle that was about to take place.

"That Graham… I never knew he was so powerful. How did you manage to even keep him under your rule for so long?" Truedream asked.

"He wasn't like this before," Jim replied. "Graham was always special, but honestly, I didn't even know about his ability to transform. It seems like one of the files of DNA I had when making the Dalki wasn't just that of a regular human, but a Werewolf.

"Werewolves were creatures that got stronger based on what they ate, which were usually the enemies they battled against. I feel stupid now; I thought that was some strange fetish of his, just like him liking to wear human clothes!"

Jim was beyond annoyed, he was the one that created these beings, and they didn't even seem thankful to him. On top of that, he was the one being tricked. If he was in the right position, Jim, at this moment, would have tried to get rid of the Dalki himself.

'Or perhaps I would enslave them and force the vampires to use them as a food source forever.'

"And that damned Cursed faction kid, what did he turn into? If I didn't know better, I wouldn't even recognised him as the same person. Is this something that all vampires can do?" Truedream asked.

Glancing at the screen, Jim was still furious, but he did have a great interest in Quinn. As someone who lived a long time, someone who studied the originals, this was something he had never seen before.

"I…I have no clue; from day one, I have had no idea with this person, but I know one thing: whatever he is right now, if he is an all-powerful being, then it means it also had to have come at a great cost. If my ability has taught me anything, it's that everything has a price.

"If you're asking me who will win, well, battles between werewolves and vampires used to plague us for centuries. In the end, the old generations determined that the Werewolves were too big of a threat for the vampires.

"They healed better than us; they were physically more capable than us. They even got stronger depending on the moon and sun. There seemed to be no limit to their powers either."

"Wow!" Trudream interrupted. "It sounds like being a werewolf has a lot more benefits than being a vampire, but in the end, you guys are here, and they are not, right?"

Jim paused for a second; it was as if he was debating whether to reveal the truth to Truedream or not.

"The difference between werewolves and us vampires were our societies and our cultures, which then became the deciding factors for their fate.

"But anyway, what we are looking at now isn't a werewolf, but a Werewolf-Dalki hybrid, which I fear is stronger than any vampire has ever lived."

————

The raindrops of blood had frozen in place; every single raindrop could be seen clearly just staying there still. It felt like time had frozen for a second, but that hadn't happened at all; everyone was still able to move.

"This amount of blood control, is it even possible for the king to do this?" Jin asked.

"No…this level of blood control is unheard of," Vincent replied.

They had seen something like this happen before but only in a smaller area or that of the settlement, the rain being still seemed to spread even further than they could see.

Graham ran forward. He didn't strike the air like he had done so many times before; no, Graham knew that he would have to use the full force of his attack. In an instant, he had reached in front of Quinn.

His deathly claw was already heading towards Quinn's face, but before it could reach it, blood had gathered in front of Quinn, similar to how the shadow would be used and blocked the attack head-on.

The moment Graham's claw clashed against the hardened blood, the energy flowed through Quinn and the ground itself, tearing it up and throwing the land either side of Quinn up in the air.

The next second after the blood had stopped the attack, it completely wrapped around Graham, consuming him whole. Quinn lifted his hand as he controlled the waves of blood, and from the rain, more blood started to cocoon Graham.

It lifted Graham and slammed him into the ground. But he recovered quickly and was slashing at the blood infront of him, but his claw could do nothing as it just went through it like real blood. Knowing that it was doing nothing but now was not in a hardened form, Graham jumped back, away from Quinn.

However, Quinn immediately threw a small handful of blood towards Graham, and when it hit his body, he felt a heavy thud towards him. Blood came rushing out of Graham's mouth, and even the green blood moved, mixing with the red.

Once again, Quinn threw another handful of blood; when it hit Graham in the body again, everyone heard a loud bang as if a tank's shell had gone off. It was clear that this was no simple attack.

"Did you say you and I are the same, Graham? Let me tell you something. You won't even get a chance to hit me this entire fight." Quinn claimed.

"You might be able to hurt me, but then why don't you try killing me?!" Graham shouted as he left both fists and slammed them into the ground. The force was so powerful it created a large crater going off nearly two kilometres in diameter.

The rocks were blown away, and the force seemed so powerful that an explosion was felt from the other side of the planet. Graham's blow had travelled through, but it didn't affect Quinn because he was now in the air. He was flying with his wings, yet they weren't flapping. It looked almost as if he was floating in the air.

"You know why I stopped the raindrops, Graham? Because I didn't want to kill you too easily." Quinn said.

Now though, one of the blood raindrops that was frozen in place started to move. It was faster than a bullet, and the second it hit Graham's body, a loud bang similar to a tank shell resounded once again, and Graham's was injured as his foot slid on the floor due to the impact.

Soon though, all the raindrops started to move and headed towards Graham.

"Ahhh!" Graham screamed as he slashed through the air, attempting to get rid of the raindrops, and he had hit a few, but there were far too many. Bang after bang reverberated through the battlefield as the raindrops hit him all over continuously, one after another.

A trail of blood streamed from his mouth, his organs hurt, and it also heavily damaged his hard hide. Still, Quinn noticed something; the wounds that Graham was getting were being self-healed fairly quickly as well.

'The Dalki get stronger through their battles, and the Werewolf body has incredible healing capabilities. For evolution, this body is the perfect base for the Dalki.' Jim thought, watching the video.

Soon, Quinn started to shape the raindrops of blood, and now he had formed them into swords. With the total amount of blood that was in the air, there had to be tens of thousands of swords of blood, now all ready to assault Graham.

Moving his hand, Quinn sent all of them to Graham at once. The swords were sharp, the blood was strong, and as expected, they pierced right through Graham's strong scales and werewolf skin. Consequently, they had gone through him, hitting him from all sides, but somehow, Graham had managed to do two things.

One, he was able to avoid the sword aimed at his head even if he had been cut all over the face multiple times, and the second was to stop the sword from hitting his heart and the hard claws.

As for the blood dripping from his wounds, it flowed and added into Quinn's blood sword.

Soon, a real blood sword formed in Quinn's hand, similar to what Arthur would use. It was created using hardened blood, and as Quinn hardened the blood, it had the same red glow as the one in his veins and wings.

"You think you avoided those on purpose?" Quinn smiled. "I usually never want to kill, not unless I have to or for my own life, but to you, I want to kill you with my own hands."

Hearing this, Graham just smiled.

"I guess you were right...I wasn't on the same level as you…but I am now."

From the top of Graham's head, something started to emerge - a spike that was larger than no other. Breaking out, all blood swords in his body shattered and fell to the ground, and the wounds on his body began to heal in front of everyone's eyes.

"You should have killed me when you had the-"

Quinn threw the sword from his hand, and it went right through Graham's chest and sent him skidding off into the distance. The camera couldn't even pick up what happened, and others only saw Quinn throw his sword, and in the next instant, Graham disappeared.

"You are still not on my level."

# Chapter 1568 - Blood Rush

For a brief second, many thought the battle was over. They could no longer see Graham on the screen, and only Quinn was present. But, not everyone was this naive. Before Quinn's attack landed on Graham, they noticed that he had managed to turn into an eight spiked Dalki successfully.

The power for each dalki upgrading from one spike to the next was considerable, and now they assumed it would be the same this time as well. At the same time, the look on Quinn's face said it all. His next set of actions seemed strange as his body started to float in the air.

Once again, his wings didn't move so much, only slightly but not quite flapping, and the red dust that looked similar to flakes of dry blood would fall from his wings as he rose up in the air.

'His body is more resilient than I thought,' Quinn spoke in his mind while staring off into the distance.

Quinn had thrown the sword too fast for Graham to react, and by the time the latter finally noticed it, the sword had already pierced his chest. Still, as the sword pierced into his body, his body almost instinctively reacted on its own.

The muscles tensed up around the sword and halted it on the spot, not letting it go in any deeper. Although the sword had been somewhat stopped, the momentum of the attack itself has sent Graham flying backwards. His feet were skidding across the ground, breaking and destroying everything he went through.

"Is this vampire's full damned strength?!" Graham shouted. "Or is it something else?"

It was strange how the momentum was even continuing now, but eventually Graham himself was feeling strength rise in him. From Graham's back, he sprouted a pair of Dalki wings. Around the edges along the top was black fur, similar to what was on the rest of his body.

Flapping his wings, Graham countered the momentum, which decreased even further, slowing him down; meanwhile, his body had time to take in the rest of the transformation. Clenching his claws around the sword, he instantly shattered it.

Finally, he came to a halt. It was hard to pinpoint his exact location or how far he had been pushed back; at least he knew it was far because he couldn't even see the vampire settlement off in the distance anymore. His green blood was pouring from his open wound, but it started to heal up quickly, and within a few seconds, he was back to his prime, or even more powerful.

"Haha, haha!" Graham started to laugh. "This battle will bring me to where I need to be."

Jumping up in the air, Graham's wings started to flap wildly, and the strong force coming from them blew the rubble that had been formed behind him due to the impact. Graham was ready for a rematch as he flew through the air and headed back in the direction he had come from.

He was moving faster than he had ever before, and his body felt like it was indestructible.

Eventually, Quinn saw a small dot approaching him, and he knew exactly what it was. Quinn gathered a small amount of blood and aimed towards this dot, and in the next moment, a vortex of blood beamed out from his hands.

Graham crashed head-on into the blood and started swiping, chipping away the vortex as he used all his strength to get closer and closer to Quinn. Although a lot of the blood was being hit away, most of it would still hit parts of Graham's body, destroying the scales around him and causing him to bleed.

At the same time, however, Graham's body was healing from all the damage the blood vortex was dealing. Lifting his other hand, Quinn created another blood vortex that spiralled from his hand and crashed into Graham.

It had managed to push Graham's body back, and this time the power was too much for him. He fell to the ground and looked hurt, bleeding, but moments later, the wounds on his body were healing again.

"I admit, I might not have more power than you, Quinn!" Graham shouted from below. "But with this body of mine, I really have become a god. It is impossible to kill me, and eventually, your power will run out. So let's see who can last longer!"

Graham slashed his claws, and as usual, a wall of blood moved to block the attack, but flowing up from the ground itself was Graham. Quinn quickly moved out of the side and hit him with the blood again, right on his side. Blood spewed out of Graham's mouth, but it didn't seem to slow him down at all as he continued to rush forward.

Eventually, the blood spiralled around Quinn's hands, creating what looked like two giant drills, and throwing his arms outward, they launched from his palm and crashed into Graham's palms, tearing them up as he blocked the drills.

Graham tried to push back against it, but they were ripping every fibre in his body. This attack by Quinn right now was the same level as what he had used against Laxmus, except the blood being used was stronger and energised by Quinn's new found power. On top of that, this time, there were two drills.

However, although it looked like Graham could not do anything to get rid of the blood drills that were spinning towards him, his hands were healing, and both parties now seemed to be at a standstill.

"Your body...is a lot harder than I thought. It just means that I will have to attack you with something that you can't heal from. Something that will finish you off in one go."

The red veins that appeared over Quinn's body were no longer fading in and out; instead, the red got only brighter and was glowing; the same was happening with Quinn's wings.

Graham was still trying to deal with the Blood drills as their power got weaker and weaker, but he could not move since the attack was still strong enough to suppress him.

This gave Quinn the time to gather his power and show the world the power and title.

The blood raindrops began to rise from the ground, adding to the dark red clouds still around the planet. All of the blood moved up, and it looked like a storm of blood was brewing.

Quinn's eyeballs started to bleed as blood fell from both of his eyes down his cheeks, only to rise up once they fell and add to the blood that was being used above.

"Can you feel that!" Fex said. His body was tingling all over; it felt like he was standing upside down as even the blood from his own body wanted to escape.

"I can...I think everyone can." Layla said as she looked around.

She also could feel the sword by her side as well. She hadn't activated it, yet it was even active now for some reason.

What they failed to realise was that even the audience were feeling something strange.

And the comments soon started to come through online.

"Hey, I'm feeling a tingle, and I don't think it's just from watching the video."

"Yeah, I feel it as well; my head is killing me!"

"I just got a nosebleed. Is this happening with everyone?!"

A strange phenomenon ensued, and from the clouds above, tornadoes of blood began to hit the ground. Not just one but multiple tornadoes hit in the area around Quinn, and moments later, red lightning strikes crackled through the clouds, creating deafening reverberations.

The lightning had the same red glow they had seen many times during the fight, and in the centre of this chaos, being untouched by everything, was Quinn. Eventually, blood began to trickle from his own mouth, nose and ears as well.

Honestly, Quinn didn't know if he was feeling pain right now or not.

He just knew that he needed to create an attack strong enough to get rid of Graham.

Eventually, the power of the two giant red blood drills had stopped, and Graham stood on the spot as his body healed from the last attack. Now. he was finally able to take in everything that was happening around him.

"Graham, you will never be able to achieve your goal. You know, I have met a few gods before, and do you know what the difference is between them and us? They will never truly die, but as for you...I will never see you again."

Quinn raised his hand and opened the palm of his hand in the direction of Graham.

"Goodbye."

# Chapter 1569 - Betting Everything

One could only imagine what thoughts were going through Graham's head as he saw Quinn's open palm. For even him, at the level he was, could feel the blood tingling in all of his body.

"You…you really have reached a different realm above mine..." Graham mumbled. "I was so close, but now I will never know."

Seeing everything around, the planet's land mass being destroyed by the tornadoes of blood, the red lightning strikes whose single touch perhaps could obliterate anyone. It was as if Graham knew that there was no longer anything he could do.

Quinn swung his hand down so fast, and with it, from the sky itself, a giant red beam shot towards Graham. At that moment, all of the tornadoes of blood and lightning moved towards the target. The red clouds were becoming no more, and all of the blood was joining up with the single beam of attack.

All of it was directed at one spot in the far distance, and as it continued to rush through, it condensed into blood-red energy. Slowly the beam from the sky stopped, and now all of the power was being held in one place.

Quinn raised both of his hands. They were shaking as he struggled to control the energy that was in front of him. He slowly pushed them closer together as blood trickled down from his face, but the red glow inside his body was beginning to fade.

Eventually, his wings seemed to give up, and he fell to the ground. Suddenly, the energy was growing more prominent again.

"ARGHHHH!" Everyone heard a voice from the inside.

"That damned Dalki is still alive even from all of that!" Fex shouted. "Quinn, you have to kill him. You have to get rid of him!"

Continuing to use all his power, Quinn began to condense the energy. Once again, it started to form into a giant red ball that was now the size of a house; as he continued, the ball of energy got smaller and smaller.

They couldn't see a figure inside the red energy, but considering that there was no Graham around, they could only guess he was inside.

"Come on, Quinn, you can do it! Use my power as well!" Layla held out her hand, it was quite far, but she was willing to give whatever energy she could towards him.

Those watching online no longer cared who or what Quinn was. If they couldn't do anything now, then at least they could cheer him on through the screen.

The power continued to condense, and once again, Quinn coughed up a mouthful of blood on the ground. His foot staggered, but he didn't fall. However, his wings began to return to his body.

"This is bad," Vincent said, and the others glanced at him, wondering what he was talking about. "I don't know what Quinn turned into, whether it was a permanent form or something temporary that he can use, but right now, it looks like he's reverting to his regular self.

"In the new form, sure he could handle all of that power, but right now, Quinn is no longer in that form. If he continues to handle that much blood, I'm afraid he's going to damage his own body and kill himself."

"What can we do?" Jin asked.

"We can stop him...I doubt Graham is alive right now; the reason why Quinn is still condensing the blood is so it doesn't suddenly break out again, because if it does...it could kill everyone on this whole planet and the ships that are near in orbit. Other than that...we can do nothing."

Hearing this, Layla had only one question to ask.

"If we stop him, will Quinn live?" She asked.

The explosion caused by the condensed blood attack wouldn't destroy the whole solar system, only get rid of all the vampires and them as well, but if Quinn would survive, Layla already knew her answer.

"We only made it this far because of the king. Everyone only survived because of the king!" Jake declared, "We have to save him."

Vincent turned to the others all around him, at those who had been with Quinn from the beginning. Since it would be their lives lost, it wasn't a decision he could make on his own.

However, it looked like everyone had decided as they all nodded.

"Order the vampires to move as far away from the planet as possible," Sam said over to Muka. "And Muka, everything will be left to you from now on; the same goes for Megan in the Cursed faction."

Owen simply made a similar call to his own Graylash faction. He was instructing them who they would follow from now on if he didn't make it.

"This is crazy! Owen, we can come back and get you!"

"No!" Owen shouted back. "If we wait too long, then Quinn will die. If anyone deserves to live, then it's him."

With the decision made, everyone was ready to rush forward under Vincent's command to stop Quinn, but before they even take the first step-

"Stop!" Quinn shouted back and turned to look at them. His eyes were glowing red, and all of them had frozen in their tracks.

"Is he using the influence skill on us…and it's actually strong enough to stop us all!" Silver said, shocked.

"I have fought and have gotten stronger to freaking save you guys... To change the world. You know, I thought it was easy, that when I got to the top, it would be easy but I realised...it isn't something a single person can do…I realised that change takes time, and I can't change this world just on my own, but… I can save it.

"Let me save the world…save all of you..this is what I want. I don't want any of you to die."

Turning around, Quinn looked back at the condensed red ball of energy that hadn't changed in size. It hadn't gotten bigger or smaller but was still as large as a house.

"Don't distract me!" Quinn said as he cancelled his influence skill because he needed to use every ounce of power he could.

"ARGHHHH!" He screamed, pushing his hands closer together, and the ball in the distance could be seen getting smaller and smaller. However, now, blood even began to flow out from his skin. It was as if the blood inside his body was under so much pressure that it had managed to burst through his skin.

The blood fell on the surface, but Quinn didn't step back. It was now, or never.

"NOOO! Quinn! You can't do this, NO!" Layla screamed so loud she felt like her own throat was bleeding. She tried to rush over, but Peter quickly pulled her back, pushing her to the ground.

"Quinn told us to stay back!" Peter shouted at them all. "No matter what, no one is going over to him. I will follow his will no matter what. Even if that means I have to use force!"

Some looked like they were going to attempt to go past and around Quinn but getting past Peter would be a mammoth of a task.

However, all of this didn't matter now.

The ball had gotten smaller now and continued to shrink; more blood poured out from Quinn, and eventually, the ball was now the same size as a tennis ball. There was no sign of Graham anymore - not a single bone, blood or anything.

Quinn had destroyed everything of him, and finally, he had placed his two hands together. The ball of red energy had finished condensing and took a solid form as it fell and rolled on the ground.

It was no longer glowing bright red and looked like a crystal almost entirely black, but a slight tint of red.

At the same time, though, Quinn had fallen to the ground as well. The others, seeing this, rushed towards him, but the vampires already knew. They knew as they approached him there was something seriously wrong because none of them, not one of them, could sense or hear any heartbeat.
