# Chapter 1530 - A Power Surge For Everyone
Out of all the attacking groups, the Earthborn group was the slowest out of them all. However, they had reason to be as they were being cautious, trying to lose as few numbers as possible and doing their best to cooperate with the vampires.

They had done well taking back the planets that initially belonged to the Earthborn group and were now finally heading into the Dalki part of the solar system. Sam had instructed them to continue ahead, and Longblade, who was leading one of the groups, understood somewhat why.

This was their only chance to win this war. Based on the reports of the new Gen Dalki so far, the new enemy seemed quite powerful, and not just by a small difference. From the information gathered, it looked like the Dalki had figured out how to create a new type of Dalki, better than the current types.

On top of that, they already knew the Dalki could get stronger by evolving, and time was not on their side. If they left the Dalki alone, the latter would create more new Gen Dalki, giving them a chance to grow more powerful.

Waiting was not an option. If they stopped their attack, it would allow the Dalki to regroup. In this case, the Dalki would just wait to create more new Gen and evolve their current forces. Although the human force was large, already having lost so many, it wasn't like their own forces could suddenly increase in strength or number.

It was a formidable force they had to face, and Longblade and his group were approaching one of the Dalki planets on which they were expecting to come across the new Gen Dalki. Along with Longblade was the thirteenth leader Lee, and the second leader Katori.

The string ability from the thirteenth vampires had helped them considerably in holding the strong Dalki in place, and they had even saved many human lives when using the former as puppets during the war.

At the same time, the second family with the reversing ability meant that they could enjoy the effects of healing that were better than normal healing. It made the Earthborn group under Longblade's command just respect the two families even more, and he was hoping he could utilise all of their powers in this fight as well.

At the same time, the other Earthborn group was made up mostly of vampires and generals, and they were able to use their brute strength to defeat the Dalki. Jin, Ken Kilton, and Dillan Scutter, three vampire leaders who had abilities suited for taking on the Dalki, really showed off their powers in the fights so far.

On top of that, since most of them in the group were vampires, the Dalki's green blood gave an extra boost while fighting.

Soon, both of these Earthborn groups would be landing on the Dalki planet, ready to go into battle.

——

An hour later.

It had only been an hour since Longblade and his vast army of a hundred thousand had landed on the planet, and they were now greatly struggling against the new Dalki. The planet they were fighting had quite large grass fields and large meadows.

This meant there weren't many strategic locations for them to use in fighting. Tactics were useless, and since they were on the attack, they had to go towards the fortress on the planet in an attempt to take it out. Currently, the new Gen Dalki had already massacred a quarter of their forces.

'This is difficult..' Longblade said while assessing the situation. 'The Dalki aren't fighting us head-on. Did they get reports from the other fortresses which our forces have defeated?'

Unlike the previous battles that had been an all-out war, the Dalki here were going on the defence and holding up in the fortress. The humans practically had to raid the place. Some of the vampires from the thirteenth family successfully scaled the wall with their abilities and brought others up with them.

But just like the reports stated, the Dalki forces were far stronger than other forces they came across. They consisted of three spikes and four spikes, and even though they weren't even large in number, taking them down seemed impossible.

'There's also that humanoid-looking one...with the abnormally long tongue. I didn't even know anyone could use a tongue like that.' Just as Longblade thought of this, he saw the humanoid Dalki coiling its tongue around someone's body, and like a frog, the Dalki pulled him towards its mouth, killing it by crushing it to pieces.

"We have no choice," Lee stated, who was also watching things go on. "We have tried to find ways to infiltrate the fortress, but none are working. We will just have to create a force of our strongest and head in together to create a gap so the rest can join in as well."

Longblade wasn't quick to agree with Lee's plan. They had already lost many lives, and he didn't want to view his people as just a number. From the reports so far, even if they were to create a potent force, the enemy can still take them out.

Before making any decision, Longblade decided to call the other Earthborn group to see how they were faring. On the other side, Jin, who was leading this force, answered, and the situation he reported was similar to how things were going here.

The Dalki were staying in their fortress, and the group had yet to figure out a way to enter the fortress. And they had also just attempted what Lee had suggested with the vampire leaders, but it turned out to be an unsuccessful attempt.

In fact, one of the vampire leaders had even lost his life. The eleventh family leader Dillan Scutter. This caused them to retreat. In the retreat itself, the Dalki were able to take out half of their forces, and now they were at a loss of what to do.

"I understand how you feel, but we won't be getting reinforcements," Longblade stated. "We have no choice but to fight to the best of our ability and hope that our side comes out as the winner."

A few moments after he said that, Longblade had received a message from someone he didn't expect. It looked like the help they needed might arrive.

He called for a temporary retreat and then told the vampires to gather for the meeting.

"We plan to attack the fortress head-on, and for that, we will require your power," Longblade said. "I hate to admit it, but we can't do this without you. I, as the leader of this group, ask you this favour, and if you can get us inside, the rest of us will try our best to get rid of the Dalki."

The vampires looked at each other in confusion. So far, attack forces had been quite mixed, but now Longblade was asking the vampires to lead the charge. Where they basically asking the vampires to be their human shield.

"Sacrifice your own people, and we will get rid of the Dalki." One of them shouted.

The others soon agreed, and Lee and Katori were ready to silence them, but Longblade shook his head, knowing that this was the expected reaction.

"There is a reason why I am asking for your help." Longblade smiled and looked up, "And that's because of them."

A ship was seen approaching the area that they had made their temporary base for now, which was quite far enough to be away from the sight range of the fortress. Besides, the Dalki weren't chasing after them, so there wasn't much trouble.

When the ship landed, two figures walked out, and with them, they pushed along a large crate that was the size of a car; as for who these two people were, they were Linda and Fex.

At the same time, landing on the other Dalki beast planet, supporting Jin and the others, was another pair doing the same thing, and this pair was Samantha and Mona.

"This here will help you win the fight. Tell all the vampires to take a drink this... and we will win this war!" Samantha instructed.

Opening up the containers, the vampires could all smell it immediately. It was Dalki blood, but not just any Dalki blood; rather, it was blood from a five spike Dalki.

One Horn's death would be the turning point in the battle. Oscar's and Sach's death wouldn't be in vain.

# Chapter 1531 - Stronger than the King

Two more of the Cursed faction groups were behind the others. They had entered the Dalki part of the beast solar system, armed with the information that the others had already gathered.

Based on the information so far, the groups believed that they were going into a tough battle ahead of them. However, one of these groups, led by Peter, wasn't nervous at all.

At the moment, he stood firm on his large ship as it approached the Dalki planet that was primarily made of what looked like ice but had a purplish tinge to it.

"Do you think Wight has some sort of problem?" The recently promoted vampire knight of the sixth family knight asked. His eyes were staring at Peter's back; to be specific, he was staring at what was around him.

"You should be careful with your words," Jake replied. "That man is the reason why we have had to do next to little work. Honestly, he is fearless, and his strength seems limitless. Sure he might have a strange taste, but that is down to him."

The other vampires at the table, along with Jake, had known him for a long time. Since he had been their leader for a while now, they were mostly at the rank of Earls working inside the sixth family castle. Yet, in all their time of serving someone, they had never seen their leader so… possessed by the person in front of them.

Watching Peter fight had absorbed him, and their leader had become a true fan. The thing was, it wasn't just him; many of the other Earls, the viscount, and vampires had become his fans. Peter's personality is what they imagined a vampire leader should be like.

No hesitation, great strength and dominating everything with his sheer power. As for what they were commentating on about his...special taste, it was about the Lesser Wights that he had chosen. Like a bodyguard, a headless human stood beside Peter at all times, and he too could utilise strong beast gear and had a strong body itself.

Then there was the five spike leader, Slicer, who had a tail faster and sharper than any Dalki and could even defeat four spike Dalki with ease. Lastly, there were two new additions to their group.

Peter had taken the highest tier Dalki he could find, two four spikes, yet one of them had only a single arm. Peter himself had ripped it off during the fight and had a hole through his chest from where Peter had killed him.

Then the other Dalki that Peter had resurrected had wings, making it quite unique. Not all Dalki had wings, except for those at the fifth tier, which was why it was a bit unique for this one.

Only Peter had made it even more unique, or to be accurate, his partner Leg's, who had cut off one of its wings during a fight now, making them practically useless. Because of this, each of the lesser Wights Peter had around him seemed to have a missing limb or two.

The others didn't know whether that was a coincidence or not, which led to some strange rumours being passed around between the vampires.

'Quinn, whenever you get stronger, I can feel the strength in me rising.' Peter thought, 'But...what I don't have is your martial arts skills or your blood powers. I've been improving the way I fight, improving my powers of the Wight...but what's this feeling I have right now?

'What is happening to you? And... what is happening to me.'

Peter couldn't quite explain it, but there was always a link between him and Quinn. Although it is said that Wights grew stronger with their leader, it is defined by the limits of the Wight's body.

However, Peter had continued to grow in strength along with Quinn, and he had a feeling it was due to the connection he could feel even now. Yet, for the first time, Peter could feel energy stronger than his body was slipping away.

'Is it me that's changing or…' Since his powers were growing as well, Peter thought perhaps this was a way for Wight to grow independently and not a special trait or circumstances.

...

The ship had anchored away from the enemy signatures. According to the latest information, there was a high possibility that the Dalki might not attack them. Instead, they would go on the defensive and wouldn't leave the fortress.

With how Peter had led so far, he stood in the front of everyone, along with his four lesser Wights in front, as they all marched forward. With the probability that the Dalki weren't going on the attack, they took the chances and landed the ship closer to the fortress.

While marching, they followed the strange ice, which had begun to make a peculiar shape. They entered what felt like a narrow ridge, with an enormous giant skyscraper of ice towers over them, but because they were leaning against each other, it allowed for some light to get through the gaps.

However, if they were to try and escape left or right, it would be somewhat impossible due to the ice all around them, unless they wanted to climb up the side of the walls until they went through the gaps.

Eventually, they saw their target in sight. The fortress was in the large gap of ice. Up ahead, they could see the fortress, and due to the ice surrounding it, they could only attack from one direction.

Far off in their distance, the Dalki stood on the wall, and among them, one of them smiled back at the group.

"So that's the humanoid type Dalki that they all have been talking about." Peter smiled. Although its body had the skin of a human, its arms were scaled, and its hands were slightly different because they looked a bit darker and worn out, turning a slight red.

It reminded Peter of Slicer's scales and the type which the other five spike Dalki would have. In addition to that, the new Gen Dalki had very long claws, much longer than usual.

'Hmm, I guess others would be scared, but I've seen scarier people.' Peter thought, thinking of Quinn's familiar.

"What's the plan?" Jake asked, noticing that Peter hadn't charged in headfirst like he usually would have done similar to before. "I thought perhaps I should go with the other vampires first. But we wouldn't go for an attack; instead, we will lay some traps on the walls and the outside. That way, it will leave the rest to take them on."

Jake thought he had come up with a good suggestion and was being a good support to Peter by suggesting this. He was actually thinking for the best of the whole group, rather than what was easy for the vampires or humans.

However, it looked like Jake was wrong about one thing.

"The plan?" Peter smiled back. "The plan is him!"

The next second and Peter took off on his own again. He had beast gear on him, not as good as Quinn's, but still at a high level. However, what he did have of Quinn's was the speed running across the ice; not even his lesser Wights could keep up with him.

"Do you think your fortress doors could hold me back!" Peter smirked.

Two four spike Dalki jumped down, trying to block Peter's path. Just then, he reached for two buttons with his hands, and jumping through the air, he thrust them forward rather than swinging them.

His attack was too fast and powerful for them; the batons went straight through their head, killing them on the spot. Seeing this, the Humanoid Dalki decided to jump down, but Peter's own Lesser Wights had caught up by then.

The two undead Dalki were the first to charge forward. The humanoid Dalki sliced their arms with its sharp claws, which fell off like gauges on the spot. Still, they were alive, and even without their arms, they were able to hit the humanoid Dalki.

"You've never fought against an undead, have you!" Peter smiled and got right in the centre, swinging the baton he would use, digging it right into the Dalki's stomach, and lifting it in the air. As soon as it fell back, the Dalki began to spin its body like a drill, and the claws shredded the body of the two undead Dalki within seconds.

Then it looked like Peter was the one that was about to get hit next. However, a quick tail slashed at the hard hands, knocking the Dalki to the side, and a large fist from the headless man punched the humanoid Dalki to the ground.

Before he could react, Peter was already above him.

"Your heart is here, right?" Peter said, and without hesitation, he stuck his baton type weapon, the tonfa, right through the chest. It wasn't a sharp weapon, but it didn't matter with his strength, and soon the heart was crushed in the ice.

The humanoid Dalki, which everyone feared and talked about, was dealt by Peter without a scratch on him, but this wasn't the end because the Dalki, in the fortress, soon jumped down and were coming towards them.

"Thank you..for making my job a little bit easier," Peter said, placing his hand on top of the humanoid Dalki. "Wake up!" He shouted, and in less than a second, the Dalki's eyes opened.

# Chapter 1532 - The stronger Group

If one was to watch the fight between Peter and the new Gen Dalki, they would have called it one-sided, but for the first time, it wouldn't be the humans being overwhelmed; instead, it was the Dalki.

So far, many of the groups had struggled against the new overpowering Dalki, but in the case of Peter, he turned out to be the perfect nemesis of them.

He himself was a strong force, but of course, there had been many strong people in the other forces too, but the difference was that Peter's strength didn't just come from himself but even from those he rose. On top of that, any difficult enemy he would face and defeat would join his side in the next battle. Using the power of all those that Peter had risen before, including himself, they were able to finish off the humanoid Dalki swiftly, and then he added it to his super team.

Still, he wasn't the only reason why this group, in particular, was able to do well. It was because of the Sixth family's ability as well. The ability to create zones and traps. Once stepped on them, the Dalki would freeze in place.

More than anything, this gave the people time. While the Dalki were trapped, they would be vulnerable to those that were strong enough to deal with them. It also allowed the others to regroup and attack at once.

Like the power of the sixth family, the humans had employed similar techniques to delay the Dalki. Even though they were the attackers, they relied on this and used it on the Dalki until Peter, his lesser Wights, or the Sixth family leader himself, killed them.

All of these things put together easily defeated the Dalki fortress that contained the new Gen Dalki. In total, from the beginning until now, Peter managed to retain around sixty percent of his initial forces, which was far better than any of the other group's performances.

They had taken over the fortress, and Peter was still in good shape. After taking over the place, they docked the ship nearby.

Onboard there were special meals just for him that he could use to restore his energy and strength. Although he only needed to eat them when he would get injured, it was almost impossible for him to with Legs around.

"It looks like you really were one of the strongest ones out of the lot… I would be interested in fighting you now at your strongest." Peter stated, but there was no response from Legs.

"There's been no response from Sam yet; he must be busy," Jake informed. "What should we do now? Do we go to the other planets that need support?"

"No," Peter replied quite quickly. "That wasn't in the plan, and by the time we got there, it would already be too late anyway. Let's stay in this part for now until we get further orders. We'll send out a few scout ships to try and find the main Dalki mothership that Sam was talking about.

Once we find it, we will inform Logan. He wanted to take a reading and scout the number of Dalki's in it."

There was a reason for this. Sam wanted all of the nine battles to be over and done with and then attack the main base with the combined forces. Or if they only had the Demon tier dragon to deal with, only send a few of them.

It would be more beneficial for them just to send in those that could deal with the new Gen Dalki. After all, it was clear that in most of the groups, the majority of the forces couldn't handle the new Dalki.

———

Although at first, it seemed like only one group had great success in fighting off the Dalki. However, there was another one: The Blade Family.

There was no grand battle on the Cursed faction planet they instructed to take back.

Vorden and the others had decided to let the surrendered Dalki live after getting Sam's instructions.

Currently, they were walking on a rock filled planet. And to be honest, they felt that they might experience something similar on this Dalki planet too.

The planet had large rocks spread over that and were spread out on the sandy surface. The sand wasn't deep like in a desert; instead, it was somewhat shallow.

"Are you upset, Raten?" Vorden asked as the group continued to march towards the suspected Dalki fortress.

"Hmph...I can't entirely agree with Sam's orders." Raten replied. "We know that Graham isn't here; we know that Graham also isn't on the base where the Demon tier dragon is. So why aren't we trying to hunt down Graham, their leader, instead?

"The Dalki aren't strong; he is. Without him, there is no Dalki in this war."

Thinking about it, Vorden and the others wondered the same thing. Now that they have dealt with Slicer and One Horn, was there anyone other than Graham that could take someone on like Sil?

"I think the point is that there might be those that are evolving," Borden answered. "We all fought against Slicer, and sure we weren't as strong as we are now, but, even if we kill Graham too, as long as the Dragon exists, more Grahams or more Slicers will come up."

"I don't know." Sil finally spoke. "I don't know if we are strong enough yet. Ever since fighting against Graham, I don't know if there is anyone strong enough. I know everyone is relying on Quinn, but if he isn't, it means that someone else will have to take him out."

"And it will be my pleasure when the time comes." Raten laughed while puffing his chest and folding his arms.

Up ahead, they suddenly noticed the Dalki fortress on a large slab of rock.

"Alright, everyone, stop here!" Vorden shouted, and the others paused, turning their attention on him as he continued, "I have decided that only a few of us are going to go in and scout ahead. We all know the reports on the new Gen Dalki and the fortress. They are strong, and in the fortress, there's no Dalki under two spikes. I don't want us losing our numbers over nothing."

"Wait!" Shiro called. He had come along with the Blades since he had made friends with a lot of them. "Are you saying just the four of you are going to take on the fortress? If we are with you, then at least we can distract them!"

"Are you saying that I should use you guys? Do you really think we are that weak!" Vorden shouted with his wings unfolding. "If we can't take them on, then it means that all of you would have just died anyway."

The others gulped upon hearing this and didn't argue anymore, allowing Blade Family to do however it wanted. They had gotten this far because of them in the first place, so right now, all they could do was trust them.

Sil had already gotten the powers that he needed from the others. Borden took out one of the syringes from Sil and held it in his hand, ready to take it. For now, though, he hopped onto Vorden's back instead.

All four of them were off to the fortress in the next second. Similar to the Peter situation against the other Dalki...it was a one-sided battle and a victory for the Blade family.

The weakest of the Blade's was Borden, who could amount to a four spike, but he had better skills than the others, and his strength seemed to be above most of them. Still, he didn't have to worry about getting badly injured because he knew the others around him were far more powerful.

Two Demon tier beasts could kill multiple of the Dalki. Raten, using his mud ability, was able to trap and kill multiple enemies at the same time. Vorden had amassed great speed in the air and wind powers in his beast form.

His wings were razor-sharp like giant steel blades. He was unmatched in the air, and swooping down, he would slice the Dalki that came in his range. Of course, then there was Sil, the strongest of them all.

Over time, with fighting the others, Sil had gathered abilities best suited to go against the Dalki. To them, the new Gen Dalki was just as easy as facing the normal Dalki because it was just a number.

———

While these two forces fought, someone was on a special mission.

After leaving Owen and the Graylash group, Nate flew around the Dalki beast planet sector, looking for the main Dalki base.

He honestly didn't know where to go, but the radar at least helped him know of the places where he had passed through, and due to it being linked to the other ships, he also knew where it wasn't, which meant he had narrowed down his search area so he could find it.

"Man... I kinda want to find it, and I kinda don't." Nate thought, but his mind was honestly thinking about other things that happened. Still, as he was drifting through space, and then, his radar screen began to blip.

It was the first thing that gave an energy signal other than the other planets he had come across.

It took him some time to reach it upon moving head to look at where the energy signal was coming from.

There was a ship as big as the Earth's moon not far from him, and he knew it was the Dalki base.

# Chapter 1533 - The last Leg

Sam and the rest had docked on the rocky planet with a frozen-wave-like surface and were waiting to make the next move. They had plenty of supplies to last them a while, and they hadn't really been there for long despite how long it felt to the army.

With nothing much to do and knowing that they would soon go into battle, time just felt like a standstill to them all.

They had set up somewhat of a base near the main ship and the other fleet of ships. Groups were taking turns to keep watch in all directions and would come back for reports. In truth, they weren't needed because, on top of that, Logan had set up sensors just in case anything unexpected came their way.

Since they noticed that the Dalki were no longer leaving their fortresses, the group believed they were safe. For the time being, they weren't attacking the Dalki fortress, which also had the new gen. Although, a few in the army wanted to act straight away.

In particular, Ivy and Peach, and even Layla. Although their reasons were understandable.

Sam was with Logan, and they had set up their own office space outside next to the spaceships. Several large crates of supplies were stacked together and placed adjacent to create temporary tables and a workplace.

Logan had several screens in front of him, and through them, he was analysing and sharing all of the information they had received from all the groups. It amazed Sam how Logan was able to work from anywhere and would always turn that area into such a mess. As there were small gadgets everywhere that Logan would play with when he had nothing else to do.

Currently, Sam was thinking back to when they had first discovered the Dalki fortress.

——

"That's.. that's…." Peach sobbed her eyes out, and so did her sister Ivy next to her. While one was a wreck of emotions, the other was comforting her, but she too was clearly in pain, as well.

"I can't believe it; those bastards really did it!" Layla controlled her urge to shout, afraid that she might blow away their cover.

"It looks like they have figured out a way to imprint specific D.N.A. into the new Dalki they have created. Perhaps a more complete Borden?" Logan spoke to himself.

"You..!" Layla gritted her teeth, picking up Logan by the scruff of his shirt and holding him up in the air. His feet were dangling off the ground. "Is that all you have to say...she...is..."

"That thing isn't her," Sam said, placing his hand on her shoulder. "Logan was just making an observation. He wasn't the one that created that thing. They used her D.N.A., mixed with the Demon tier beast, to create that. I understand how you feel. It's disgusting and disrespectful to see the Dalki do that to her. But why are you lashing out at Logan?"

Letting go of Logan, Layla quickly apologised and even bowed down. Sam was right. It was just unexpected to see Helen like that of all things.

"Alright, so what's the plan? I'm happy to go out in front and take those guys down." Layla declared and was already gripping the sword's hilt in her hand.

"For now…I think the best decision would be to wait." Sam suggested.

"Wait? But we came here to fight; what's the use of waiting?!" Peach, who was on the ground, shouted in rage. The two sisters were ready to kill whatever that imitation of their sister was, and the group with them, which was mainly composed of those in the Daisy faction, felt the same.

"Let me explain it to you." Sam sighed. "Out of all the planets in the Beast solar system, this one is located right in the centre. It's a strategic location for the Dalki. They can support the other groups from left to the right, and they can even continue going forward and enter our part of the solar system.

"On top of that, if the main Dalki base is located behind it like I suspect it is, they can even go to support that group as well. Right now, while we are here observing them, we are making them stay put.

"If they try to move, we can attack them right here and do more damage, losing negligible forces. However, I believe they already know this. Maybe they just didn't think that we would get here that fast. Now, if we camp here, it will work as good intimidation, and these Dalki will be forced to remain in their fortress, unable to help any of the other fortresses.

"So, for now, let's just wait and see how the other groups are doing."

———

Thinking back to that, it looked like Sam had finally received all the information that he needed to make his own move in this war as well.

'Out of the nine battles so far, both Graylash families won their battles. Owen and Grim have retreated but lost too much from their groups. Then from the Cursed faction, Graham was last seen by them.

'From what we have heard…the group and Sunny have lost the battle there. Where Graham is now, we have no idea. We lost Sach to One Horn, but his group defeated him. Because of that, now the Dalki from one of the planets is heading towards the Daisy faction. Honestly, this is one of my major worries.

'Still, the good news is that the other two Earthborn groups will most likely win their battles, but whether we can utilise their forces after that is another thing altogether. Then out of the Cursed faction, the Blade's and Peter have done remarkably well.'

There was one thing they were waiting for. After Nate had discovered the main Dalki base, they were trying to get energy reading's from it. The problem was, just as Sam had suspected, the main Dalki base was behind the current planet they were on.

No matter what, since the forces from this planet could not support the main base, they needed to take it out. Finally, though, an energy reading had come back from the main planet.

"I don't know whether we are lucky or unlucky," Logan said. "The energy reading on the Dalki planet itself is the same as the forces so far on the other planets."

To Sam, this was good news because it meant the Dalki would be no more challenging than what they had faced so far. This also meant that there was no need to send an army of humans; a strong team would suffice to go and deal with the situation.

"Send an order out." Sam finally said after thinking about it for a while. "Nate, the Blades, Fex, Linda, Peter, Jake Muscat are to head on to take out the Demon tier beast and will enter the Dalki planet alone.

"As for us, it's time for us to make a move as well. We will proceed to attack the Dalki fortress. Once we are done here, we will split up our forces. Some of us will head to the main Dalki base to support Nate and the others, while the others will return to the Daisy faction to defend."

Logan understood and sent out the order, but there was one nail biting volatile factor in Sam's plan who could disrupt their whole plan: Graham.

Graham would most likely be making his next move right now, and in Sam's head, there were three options. Graham alone was a strong enough force to try and take out the planets that we had just claimed, destroying the weakened forces one by one. This was the most unlikely option, but Sam imagined it would cause them the most trouble since he would have to manoeuvre everyone as quickly as possible to defend.

However, the other two options that were likely would make either one fail. Graham would either go back to defend the Dalki main base planet to protect his precious Demon tier beast. Or the most likely option, which Sam hadn't told anyone yet based on his personality.

Soon, he would join the attack force on the Daisy planet and take it down.

'Graham...I hope I'm not right...You are confident in your strength, and that's why you've left us the demon tier beast. Why does the main ship matter if you can kill us all to get your demon tier beast back?

'But if that's the case…we have won this battle, and then it will just be down to Quinn and Graham to battle it out. I feel bad for the vampire settlement, but this is the best choice.'

——

Just then, in the very same vampire settlement, most of the vampires were staying in their homes. However, a few would remain stationed on the strongly fortified walls, and they were even those who would stand in the defensive towers their king had built.

They looked outward to see if they could spot anything since all of the vampires were alerted of the incoming attack. With no leaders to help them currently, they were on their own for now.

"They're here, I see it!" One of the vampires shouted down to the rest.

They sounded an alarm, and now all the vampires knew the war for survival was about to begin because off in the distance, above beautiful flower meadows, there was a Dalki mothership coming towards them.

*****

# Chapter 1534 - A second chance to win

The decision had been made and everyone was informed about what they needed to do next. They were also made aware of the unfortunate and fortunate events that had happened so far around the beast solar system. However, there was one detail that Sam kept from most, and that was regarding Nicu's death.

They had been informed to be weary and careful if they were to see a black or blonde haired female, and those that knew it was Erin, they were told about it as well. After all, not everyone knew about who Erin was or where she had come from, and Sam was sure that Quinn wanted to keep it that way for now. The good thing was for the vampires that were the least of their worries. However, just when the vampire settlement was about to be attacked. Sam believed it was better that they didn't know the first leader had died during battle.

Still, there was one more group that hadn't been made aware of what had happened with Erin, and that was Sam's own group. This was because if they did see her, he could warn them on the spot, and at the same time, there was one person in the group that was already emotionally unstable as it was. If he were to add to that, Sam didn't know what would happen and if her life was to be lost in this battle as well, he didn't know how that person in particular would act.

"So, what's the plan?" Dennis asked, as the leaders walked out front, and the group was heading towards the fortress. The current group was half the size that it originally was, as Sam had left half of them behind to look after the Ship.

There were two reasons for this. One of them being that they needed to protect the ship if they wanted to head back towards the vampire settlement. Logan had also brought along a portable teleporter, so it wouldn't be too much of a problem.

An anti jammer had also been sent out to Nate and the others to be used once they reached the Dalki home planet. That way, reinforcements couldn't suddenly come. Of course there was a chance they had a way around this, yet Logan thought that to be unlikely.

According to him, they would have to get their hands on his anti jammer device that was different to the Dalki's to reverse engineer it. Worse case scenario, it would at least buy them some time. It certainly was a good thing that Logan was on their side.

Still, there were some great minds that were with the Dalki as well.

The real reason why Sam had decided for half of the forces to stay behind was because they were useless. With the emergency of the New Gen Dalki, the fact that numbers weren't particularly helpful was just further cemented. Only to be used to delay the Dalki to getting them before the others.

Half the force was the number he had come up with, which would determine whether they would be able to beat the New Gen Dalki or not. Losing beyond this number, In the amount of time it would take, if the others hadn't dealt with the Dalki by then they would have lost this battle anyway.

"So far we have only seen one Humanoid Dalki, but there have been cases at other Shelters with them being two." Sam explained. "We will make two teams, one to deal with the humanoid Dalki and the other to help out the attack force against the others."

The two groups were as follows. Vincent, Layla, and the two Daisy sisters were to take on the Humanoid Dalki. While Sam, Dennis, and Logan would lead the rest of the group to raid the fortress and go for the other strong Dalki.

They soon came into sight, and the group split up. There were also a few strong members in the Daisy faction and vampires that would be somewhat supporting the attack force of the humanoid Dalki.

"Move carefully!" Sam ordered as the group were getting ready to sprint across the field at any second. They had ranged ability users, and once they were in range they would send out their attacks first. As powerful as they could, and that was when the rest of them would charge in towards the fortress.

He needed to see how they would react, if they would rush out, or if they would continue to protect the fortress. However, before they had even reached the fortress at a range that the ability users could start their siege, one of the Dalki that was looking out towards them leapt up in the air.

They could see it high up like a small dot, and eventually it crashed and landed on its own out in the open. It wasn't just any Dalki though, it was the humanoid Dalki that had the appearance of Helen.

"Should we charge in?" Dennis asked. "This wasn't in the plan."

It surely wasn't, and as the strategist and leader, Sam now needed to adjust to his plans, but none of the other Dalki were moving out. The next second, though, the Dalki Helen started to speak.

"I've come here with a proposal. " Dalki Helen announced quite loudly. Those around Sam could hear her, but not the humans beyond them. "I know that you vampires can hear me."

"We shouldn't be listening to whatever she has to say. We just need to attack. Now's our chance to take out the humanoid Dalki while she's on her own. I doubt the others can come to help her in time." Vincent advised Sam.

Because of this, Sam gave the nod, but the next second, just as they were all about to move, something sprouted from the ground and readily grabbed Sam. It looked like a Dalki hand had grown from the ground itself.

It soon smashed Sam on the floor and kept him in place.

"You vampires aren't the only ones with good hearing. There will be no sneaky plans, and if you don't agree, I will kill him on the spot.'' Dalki Helen warned them. "My proposal is in the best interest of both our groups. We'll have a duel, your strongest representative against me.

"I have heard the reports of the other places so far. I believe that we all understand the current situation. If you can't defeat me, then it's hopeless for your side, yet if I can't beat your strongest, then it would be the same for my side."

After making this proposal, many of them looked towards Sam to make a decision, but his mouth was covered up. It looked like whatever was holding him in place was made from roots or some type of plant, but at a closer look, it had the same set of scales as the Dalki.

They were all sure that it had to be the Dalki Helen's doing.

"Vincent, you're the next in charge, what do we do?" Dennis asked.

"The proposal might actually be in our favour. Honestly, though, I have trouble believing that the losing side will adhere to the conditions. If we lose, then a battle will probably still break out. If they lose, it would be the same, but it does give us the chance to get rid of the most problematic one.

"The question is… is there a single one among us that is strong enough to fight the humanoid Dalki on their own. She seems to be serious about the duel, since they are holding Sam hostage rather than killing him. … It also means we have to take part if we don't want to lose him."

"Shall I make things easier for you?" Dalki questioned.

The next moment, the strange roots started to move, still moving on to Sam. However, they were moving away from the fortress, as well as the attacking forces. The roots stopped when they were a fair distance away from everyone.

"You're correct, you don't really have a choice if you want to save him. If you win, I assure you that I will do everything in my power to make sure the rest of the Dalki don't act. Can't you see, all of them are being good little boys right now and staying back there?

"They listen to me, so don't worry about that. I offer you this proposal because I just want to protect as many of their lives as possible, just like you do on your side. A duel should decide things while also minimising the loss of life."

With the conditions made, and the situation they were all in, it was hard for them to really say no to the proposal, even if it felt more like blackmail. So now, they needed to decide who would be the one to come forward.

The sisters looked at each other, they wanted to go and get revenge for Helen, killing this cheap imitation of her. However, their strength relied on each other and they were unsure if they could do the job, especially since Dalki Helen only wanted to fight a single person.

"I guess, I'm the best shot we have." Vincent eventually stated. "I'm just as strong as Quinn and I have a lot of experience, on top of that I can use my Blood powers. However, that's it, I don't have an ability… but I still think I'm the best chance we have."

.They had seen Vincent's strength, he was indeed strong, but… was that enough?

"No." One person disagreed, already walking in front of the others. "Vincent, I'm sorry, but I want to take this one. I think I'm the best chance we have. I know you're strong, probably stronger than me… but this is more of a personal matter for me. Furthermore, I have to do this, and I promise I will take her down… no matter the price I have to pay for it."

With that, Layla walked in front of the others. Hearing such conviction in her voice, Vincent couldn't really do anything but smile.

"Good luck."

Layla stood a good few metres away from the Dalki Helen, and the two were quite far away from the fortress and the attack force. Far away from them not to get involved.

'I lost to you once in a duel… and I guess this is my chance to make up for that. I will free you from your pain, Helen.'

# Chapter 1535 - A rematch of the Century

Everyone was carefully watching the fight that was about to happen in front of them. Their hands were tense as they were preparing to rush in at any moment. A lot of them had already decided that if the fight looked to be going one way, then they would have no choice, to jump in.

Hopefully, they would be so overwhelmed that they wouldn't have time to get rid of Sam. Still, they at least hoped that Layla would be enough to defeat the humanoid Dalki leader in front of them.

"Is she strong?" Ruby, who had come along on this trip, asked. She had hardly done any fighting so far, but there were a lot of those that had this same thought, they had seen Layla fight but during the fight she had used nothing but her arrows. Sure it was stronger than them but enough to send her out instead of the others?

"I think she has a good chance." Ivy answered. "A long time ago, our sister told us that she had a fight with the very girl that is fighting now. I know that isn't our sister out there, but if she has her D.N.A, I have no doubt that this humanoid Dalki will be strong.

"Although our sister had defeated that girl, she told us that she was one of the most amazing people she had ever fought against. Helen even admitted that she had the feeling that one day, Layla might be able to surpass her."

Although it was nice hearing those words, Vincent thought otherwise. This wasn't just Helen, no, it was some type of Super Helen mixed in with a Demon tier beast. Sure, Layla had significantly gotten stronger in a short amount of time, but without a doubt Dalki Helen was stronger than her human counterpart.

'We don't even know how many spikes she has on her back… the ones we have seen so far had been four spikes. Can Layla defeat something stronger than a four spike on her own?' Vincent worried about that possibility, especially since Layla's forte so far had been supporting her allies over going in alone.

What's more, from the reports they had received the New Gen Dalki with four spikes were clearly stronger than their more beast-like brethren, though fortunately not as strong as five spike Dalki leader yet.

The next second, while having his thoughts, Vincent's eyes widened as Dalki Helen prepared to get into battle, twisting her body side to side.

"Someone, please tell me that I'm just bad at counting." Dennis pleaded, but the others saw the same thing.

All of them there could clearly see that the humanoid Dalki with Helen's appearance had a total of five spikes.

"This isn't good… if all the New Gen Dalki are stronger than the old version, then she might surpass the Dalki leaders!" Vincent shouted. "We have to get her out, otherwise she'll die!!!"

No matter how strong Layla might be, it would be suicide to have her solo someone like One Horn, Green Horn or Slicer… much less, if Dalki Helen actually surpassed them!

'Sam was right, we have to get rid of the Dragon before they can create more of these monsters, but now without Quinn I'm afraid that we might not make it out of this one alive.'

Just then, Vincent shuffled forward, yet the strange vine-like structure that still held Sam hostage tightened its grip, and they all could hear the sound of his muffled screams.

"Are you trying to back out of our deal?" Helen Dalki questioned them, annoyed. "Even if you lose, I'll allow you to get off this planet. However, you've made your choice. Just pray this girl can entertain me for a while!"

'She doesn't seem to regard us as a threat, yet she's still keeping an eye on us. She's right, the only thing we can hope for, is that Layla is somehow able to do a good enough job to get her full attention. Then, once we've saved Sam, we can try to back her up. Until then, we're just going to have to wait for Quinn to be done with whatever he's doing.'

Standing there, the fight looked like it was about to start. Layla placed her bow on her back and instead drew out her black sword. It didn't take long for her to gather her negative emotions, because there were plenty of negative emotions to take from herself due to the form the Dalki before her had.

It didn't take long for her body to start to change. The others hadn't seen Layla take this form in front of them, but the horns started to appear on her head, her fangs widened, and her eyes started to glow red as she took on the True Hannya form.

"I'm glad that it's you I'm fighting. I don't know why, but I can feel my blood boiling when I see you before me. Keep going, I wish to go all out against you!" Helen shouted, and stomped her foot onto the ground.

A few seconds later, Layla could feel the earth rumbling underneath her. She soon started to move from the spot where another strange root came bursting from the ground. Just like the one that had captured Sam, it too had Dalki parts.

After shooting out, they didn't stop, instead they began chasing her. Jumping, Layla dodged a few of them, and landed on top of the trunk of another, but soon after another one of the roots came through the ground underneath her.

Layla could see the end of the root resembled something similar to that of a Dalki hand. Seeing this, she swung her sword with as much force as possible but was unable to cut the strange root.

'These scales are actually as hard as a Dalki's. The sword doesn't allow me to use Qi, without it, I might never be able to cut this thing.'

She continued to skid across the top, and started to focus the first stage of Qi into her arms, giving her more strength but even then it seemed too much. As a last ditch effort, opening her mouth, flames spread onto the roots.

The flames were large, and covered the entire area, and the next second, out from the other end, Layla was seen heading straight towards Helen, with five arrows hovering around her and spinning. Blue flames had also covered her hands, giving her another buff in power.

All five of the arrows were aimed towards Helen, and were spiralling in different directions, trying to go towards her. Layla was showing no fear as she ran ahead. Thrusting her sword at the same time, as the arrows came in for the attack, she was planning to get in a clear strike.

'Her body isn't covered in scales like the rest, this has to be her weakness!' She thought as she thrusted it forward. The arrows went towards the back, but before they could reach Dalki Helen's roots sprung from behind it as well, grabbing the arrows midair.

As for the front, Helen had stopped the attack with her bare hand.

"This sword is a good sword… I can't even break it using my strength, but it's a shame." Helen sighed. "I was looking forward to a good fight… Is this really the best you got?"

A strong kick was directed at Layla, hitting her in the stomach Layla refused to let go but Helen felt something strange and released, it caused Layla's body to suddenly slide across the floor. Placing her sword in the ground and using her abilities, she soon stopped herself. It was a strong kick that had come from Dalki Helen, who thought that it would be enough to kill the female human, but Layla looked strangely unhurt.

She didn't seem injured, nor was there so much as blood coming from her mouth. She had used the second stage to block the attack, but that was it. Meanwhile, where the others were, Ivy had collapsed and fallen to the floor out of nowhere. It looked like her stomach had been completely destroyed… worst of all, she was dead.

Vincent turned, wondering what was going on, and he couldn't quite believe it.

'Layla… when did she use the Spiritual Link?'

It was a skill of the Hannya, to create a link with another and all damage that would be done to her, would be redirected to another. At first, Layla thought that the skill could only be used one way, where she would take the damage to the other person.

But she had realised something, she wasn't quite sure, but she had feelings while in this form, she could have it go the other way. She was hoping to use it on Helen Dalki, but there seemed to be a condition.

The receiving person needed to be willing to accept the backlash. Layla, beforehand, had informed the sisters that this might be something she needed to do. Both of them had agreed, and the two of them now had a Spiritual Link with Layla. They would take on the damage that she was meant to take.

What none of them had expected was that a single hit from Dalki Helen would kill one of them on the spot.

'NOOOOO!!!! I'm so sorry, Ivy… I NEVER INTENDED for this to happen… I planned to heal you with my green fire… I hope you'll be able to forgive me, Peach… First Helen, and now you've lost Ivy because of me. I-I… I've already gone too far. I-I have to finish this fight.' Layla strengthened her determination as she cancelled the Spiritual Link, unwilling to be responsible for another death.

Fuelled by anger, Layla summoned countless black balls. These were the floating balls of the Spiritual Chains. However, she had a feeling that it wouldn't be enough. At best, it might be able to hold Helen for a few seconds, even before she could move.

"It looks like you have some tricks up your sleeve." Dalki Helen let out a smile, as she got ready to charge her opponent. "I guess this fight might actually entertain me, after all. Now, try not to die too quickly!"

"I know I've lost against you last time, Helen… but I promise you I'll win this time." Layla stated, as she focused and a bright light was starting to form inside her.

"I know I'm weak, and that most of my power is not my own. This form I got because of Quinn, the large Qi reserve I got from my mother, and now… I even had one of your sisters pay the price of her life, while I was the one fighting you…

"However, I learnt that borrowing powers from others is my power, and I'll do whatever it takes to beat you!!!"

Layla was summoning out her soul weapon.

*****

# Chapter 1536 - A Third type of Soul Weapon

While Layla was in the middle of summoning her soul weapon, she started to recall her lessons with Leo and Erin. Before they had gone on the offensive against the Dalki, she had enjoyed the opportunity to train with the two great swordsmen.

Leo had stated that there was a way for both of them to increase their power drastically and fast. However, to do that, she would have to unlock her soul weapon…

——

Both Erin and Layla were in the training room together. Their swords were constantly clashing against each other. The Hannya was currently in her second form, as she continued to block attack after attack from the aggressive Dhampir.

Layla was using everything in her power to block Erin's attack, including her Qi. In the end, though, the difference in experience resulted in the former slipping up. One of the latter's strikes had hit her too hard and too many times causing a slip in concentration which caused her feet to tumble and for her to fall to the ground slightly. The next second, Layla found Erin's blade pointed towards her neck.

Pulling it back, Erin offered her hand, the two of them were covered in sweat.

"You did good, Layla. For someone who started out with a different weapon and is trying to switch, you are improving fast." Erin praised the other young woman, as the two of them took a break.

Layla didn't reply straight away, still trying to catch her breath, whereas Erin had already regained hers. Leo looked to be waiting for Layla to get back in fighting condition before they could move onto the next part.

"You… were going easy on me, weren't you?" Layla eventually asked. "Just be honest. How am I meant to improve if you're holding back?"

"If you're talking about the strength in my strikes, then I can assure you that I wasn't holding back. You have to remember your sword is special, and your Qi powers are strong." Erin reassured her, hitting her friend on the shoulder.

"If you're talking about skill, then yes, I didn't aim to cripple or incapacitate you. Learning swordsmanship is like learning a musical instrument. There are many techniques and styles, but each one of them has a foundation. If you haven't learned the basics, then me doing all the other stuff will mean nothing to you. Besides, that wasn't the point of today's training."

"Alright you two." Leo clapped his hands to get their attention, as he turned around. "I believe you have had enough rest. It's time to move onto the next part."

The two girls got up, and stood a few metres apart from each other. Soon they closed their eyes and started to focus. They had been doing this for the last few days now, which was why Leo had said nothing. They were both training to summon their soul weapon.

Pushing one to the edge was meant to help summon it, yet at the same time, they needed to focus, which was why Leo was training them in this manner with small breaks in between. However, as they continued to focus Layla could feel… absolutely nothing.

The same could not be said about Erin, though. When Layla looked over, she could see a warm glow starting to appear, but it soon vanished on the spot, going away just like that.

"It looks like you are coming quite a way. Let's take a break for now." Leo suggested.

The girls were taking a break, or at least Layla was. Erin continued practising her swordsmanship, and without a partner that was considerably weaker than her to slow her down, she fully displayed her skills.

"Your aura is all over the place. Tell me what's wrong?" Leo asked as he had walked to her side.

Layla sighed since the answer was pretty obvious.

"I don't feel like I'm even a single step closer than when we started. Last time we tried that soul weapon machine, and it didn't work for me either. I thought that might be because I am a vampire subclass but still…

"That can't be the case, since Erin seems to have one, and the vampires, while they don't seem to have one, they're at least able to summon an inner blood weapon. Quinn is even able to do some sort of mix of both, whereas I… Is there something wrong with me? Am I just not meant to have either?" She asked, clearly frustrated.

Before answering, Leo looked towards Erin's way and the two of them watched her swordsmanship for a while, until the Blind Swordsman eventually answered.

"Did you know, I didn't discover my soul weapon until very late in my life, Layla. My teacher used to praise me for being a rare genius and true talent for Qi, yet I couldn't summon a soul weapon like everyone else.

"There was a point in time when I felt exactly the same way as you are now."

Layla was finding this hard to believe, and it seemed more like a story he had come up with to make her feel better. Leo seemed so wise and perfect in everything, yet she also knew he was a true master of hard work and discipline. If anyone could defeat a being above them with skill, it was this person.

"According to my master, soul weapons can be categorised into two types, the item type and the enhancement type. However, I believe that is actually a third group." Leo started to explain. "The item type is simple enough. Once you get the hang of forming your soul into a ball in your hand, an item can be produced. It's quite clear when you have achieved it, but learning the ins and outs of the item itself can be hard.

"The enhancement type, though, has always been different from user to user. Sometimes it can be very clear when a soul weapon has been summoned, while at other times it isn't quite as straight forward.

"The latter is similar to my soul weapon. It enhanced my abilities but to what degree. That was difficult in itself to find out or discover. The reason I believe you are struggling right now is because rather than figuring out how to summon your soul weapon, you need to figure out what it would do.

"The process might sound backwards for people like me and you, and in some ways we might never figure out what our soul weapons are."

At first, Layla thought that maybe Leo was giving her hope, but the last sentence truly frightened her, and she soon stood up from the ground in a panic.

"But didn't you just say, you did?" Layla questioned him. "How did you figure out your soul weapon without summoning it, then?"

"The same way that you and Erin have been doing so far. We have been attempting to put you in life or death situations. In a way, this is similar to the training Hilston Blade had forced his family to undergo, but you probably know the answer to that yourself.

"Think, is there something that you have been able to do that others can't? That was when it first hit me. When I told my master, I was able to manipulate the aura I could see and feel. That was something that he couldn't do."

Pondering about this question for a while, it had eventually hit Layla, there was something that she could do, that combined all her powers. Could that be her soul weapon?

——

Back on the field, Layla opened her eyes wide, as the soul weapon spread through her body and she could feel energy burning through her fingertips.

"I thank Quinn for giving me this special body, without it, I don't think I would have ever been able to utilise my soul weapon properly!" Layla shouted towards Helen.

"Quinn…" Dalki Helen uttered the name with a strange expression on her face.

When using her powers of telekinesis, Layla had already been able to transfer her Qi to others. She could power her arrows with Qi, and transfer what was of hers into another body. This was something that she could do that others couldn't.

A soul weapon adapted and formed based on the user, and for Layla it was clearly something she could use.

"I… I feel weaker." Dennis suddenly said, but it wasn't only him. All the others, including the large army of fifty thousand or so, all started to feel as if part of their strength had disappeared. At the same time, the humanoid Dalki itself could feel her energy being drained away.

While Layla could give others Qi, her soul weapon allowed her to steal Qi from others and add it to her own. Right now, she was draining everyone nearby.

*****

# Chapter 1537 - Calling to me

When using her soul weapon, and absorbing the energy from those around her, Layla needed to be a little careful. For one, she knew that not everyone practised Qi. It would be very dangerous to take away a large amount from those people, since it was their life force.

Luckily, there were more than enough people around, that the process would hopefully just weaken them temporarily. Unfortunately, taking in that energy wasn't easy. It worked similarly to her telekinesis ability. Where she had to use her ability on each one as if she was lifting a force from them.

After absorbing so much energy, Layla stood there and took a stance with her sword. Her skin appeared to be somewhat glowing, making the black sword stand out even more.

"Now, things are starting to get exciting." Helen Dalki grinned as she looked at her own hand. "I can feel you sapping away the energy from my own body at this very second. As much as I would love to see how strong you can get… I won't just stand around and wait for you to be finished."

Throwing out her very own arm from around twenty or so metres away, it started to extend. The Dalki part of it became similar to the strange looking vines. Seeing this, Layla lifted her sword up above her head.

She gathered as much Qi as she could and waited for the perfect time. The Hannya could see the hand approach her. Swinging down, the black sword clashed against the hard scales and fingertips, but the next second the fingers gripped onto the weapon.

"Too bad, looks like my scales are still stronger than your attack." With this, Dalki Helen retracted her arm, and since Layla refused to let go of the black sword her body was being dragged across the field.

'Even with that much Qi, I still can't hurt her?! Just how strong are these New Gen Dalki?!' Layla started to panic somewhat. 'No, I have to calm down. I can't hurry the process… if I drain too much energy, I'll be responsible for more deaths than just Ivy's.

"The longer the fight lasts, the stronger my attacks will be. I'll just have to keep her occupied until I'm strong enough to defeat her! I'll aim for that fleshy body of hers.'

Just as Layla was about to reach Helen Dalki, the Qi was concentrated in her arms, swinging the sword, she moved one of the arms to the side. Still, Helen Dalki was fast and used her other hand to throw a punch towards Layla's face.

However, the young woman wasn't just idling. Layla threw out a black ball and the second it touched Helen, black chains surrounded her, freezing her in place. The Spiritual Chains broke easily, unable to hold down the humanoid Dalki's great strength.

Nevertheless, it bought her opponent a fraction of a second… and that was all she needed to swoop around to the side, and ready the black sword.

In the middle of her strike, though, something burst through the ground again. Placing her sword below, she managed to somewhat stop it, and if she was a second later, then she would have been done for.

'Time… I just need more time to beat her!' Layla thought.

Right now, Helen Dalki didn't seem to be too greatly affected by Layla's soul weapon. Unfortunately for the Hannya, she was unable to control the speed of each individual draining target. As such, the humanoid Dalki was moving just as fast as before.

With one hand out, Layla pushed herself with her ability, allowing the vine to continue going upward, but soon another one came towards her.

"How many of these things are there?!"

Taking a swing, Layla planned to hit it away like she had done all the others. When she swung, it hit nothing but thin air. The vine-like arm had bent avoiding the blow and as quick as it avoided the blow it came out and reached grabbing Layla's left arm.

'That's not good, she got me!'

Seeing this, the other vine-like arm from before, was now heading straight for Layla, she had to think fast, and she only saw one option. With the black blade, she swung just past her own shoulder. The Qi that would have been covering that area she got rid of it, and now one arm was left with the Dalki, before she eventually landed on the floor.

Blood was spewing on the ground, but slowly the wound was starting to heal, and using her green flame she spat out from her mouth, it healed quicker than before.

"She lost a freaking arm!" Dennis shouted. "We have to help her! I don't care if she might be getting stronger, there is no way she's going to win this battle unless we intervene!!!"

That was when Vincent looked over toward Sam to see if he was okay. He looked to be still wrapped up by one of those strange vines.

'In the fight so far, Helen Dalki has only used two of those strange vine arms most of the time. But there have been some instances where she has used four like when she had blocked those arrows, then there is one wrapped around Sam as well.

'We don't know if there aren't more of these things around. This humanoid five spike Dalki, is too much… I'm not even sure, I could handle her on my own. How many casualties will we have if we try to fight her… , and our forces are being weakened due to Layla's power.'

However, there was one person that was acting and Vincent knew it. Logan had dispersed some of his spiders to have a look and move over to Sam's position. Still, there was a big problem, because the strange vine-like arms scales were just as hard as those on a normal Dalki. It was unlikely that Logan could do anything without getting Dalki Helen's attention.

Layla was no longer bleeding, but she was now down one arm, which was now with Dalki Helen. The vine had retracted and handed the arm back over to Helen. To which she threw off into the grand distance far away, almost landing right where Sam was.

"I thought that perhaps with that yellow glow all over your body you would have gotten stronger, but that doesn't seem to be the case at all." Dalki Helen sighed in disappointment, pushing off the ground, and coming for the attack. One punch, Layla gathered a second stage of Qi, to create some type of barrier wall and block the attack.

She held the black sword in place as well. The punch broke through the qi barrier, and hit the sword, causing Layla to skid across the ground. Her remaining hand felt numb without the support of the other, taking the hit despite all the power she had.

'I'll stop taking the Qi from all the others, and just focus on taking it from her!' Layla decided. Doing this, the increase she was gaining in power was lessened, but the drain on her opponent should be more effective. Helen Dalki continued to punch, and all Layla could do was create Qi barriers and use the first stage to empower herself to block attack after attack.

When looking at Dalki Helen this way, and Layla blocking attack after attack, it reminded the young woman of when she was training against Erin. Too weak to do anything, too weak to retaliate.

'What would they do…what would they have done if they were in the same situation... ' The Hannya wondered.

"You're good at blocking, but you will never win a fight this way. Don't you care about the people behind you! Do you even care about anyone but yourself? Is this all you can do… I thought you wanted to help Quinn? What's the use of him having someone so weak by his side like you? You don't deserve him!" Finishing these words, four of the strange vine's rose up behind Helen's back.

It was now as if she had a set of six arms on her. The strange vines and the Dalki's own arms.

'I can't block it... I can't block enough of the attack... and she isn't getting weaker…am I going to die here?' Layla didn't want to accept such a fate.

Her hand started to shake, and Layla initially thought it was due to her trembling. The next moment, she realised that wasn't the case, and that the black sword was shaking on its own. Layla thought she was hallucinating, but a weak voice seemed to whisper something to her.

'Let me…take over…'

Listening to it carefully, and feeling the power, without a doubt the sound was originating from her own weapon.

# Chapter 1538 - The Black Sword Strength

So far, everything Layla had tried to do had been insufficient to deal with her opponent. She was at a loss and now, with six Dalki arms coming towards her, the Hannya thought that this might be how things were going to end.

'If I die here now… after having weakened everyone, they will have no chance to take over the place… I would have not just failed everyone but made it worse for the others…'

Looking over at Sam, and feeling the worries of the people behind her, Layla was desperately looking for some way out of the dire situation. Alas, there was no sudden boost in power, or growing emotions that would help her overcome this one.

However, the departure call seemed to resonate with someone, or perhaps it was more correct to say something.

"Let me take over!" The voice shouted, and the black sword in her hand was shaking even more. Layla had figured out where the voice in her head was coming from. The question was should she trust it or give in to the strange power she had heard for the first time.

However, in the end, what other choice did she have? Layla could feel a strange energy coming from the sword itself. She wasn't sure what it meant by 'take over', but she could tell that the weapon wanted her to stop resisting.

She allowed the Qi that had surrounded her body to dissipate, and at the same time, Helen felt the sapping energy disappear. Instead, a strange energy started to run up Layla's arm and circulated throughout her body.

While all of this happened, strange voices began to resonate in the Hannya's head. Layla could hear soul-chilling screams, the sounds of crying that told of a pain like no other. It didn't take her long to start regretting her decision, but at least the sword had not lied to her. While in this state, the Hannya's body was moving on its own.

When she opened her eyes again, she could see herself a few feet away from the humanoid Dalki, and on the ground four of the vine-like limbs had been cut off, green blood pouring from them. It looked like the vines were also somehow linked to Helen's Dalki body, since green blood had spilt from it as well.

"Something's wrong." Helen noted, as the blood continued to drip from the vines and eventually fell on the ground as if they were no longer alive. "How are you suddenly able to cut my hard scales?! Why aren't they regrowing? What is that Cursed Sword?!"

The others who were watching, especially Vincent, were ready to jump in to join the fight. Vincent didn't care what price he would have to pay, he had lived a long life and his current body was nothing but a clone. He couldn't imagine how Quinn would feel if they would have to tell him that they had allowed Layla to die… at the hands of a Dalki version of Helen, no less, while all of them had just stayed by the side.

However, just as he started to move, he could see the sword moving in a perfect circle, and as it hit the strange Dalki vines it ripped through them one by one.

"What is that sword? Is it another Demon tier weapon?" Dennis asked, which was the question on everyone's mind who was watching the same fight. Although Layla had missed it, there was another detail of the sword that had occurred during its attack.

For a brief moment, a strange winged bat symbol had lit up. The others could only guess that it was some type of active skill the sword had used, allowing Layla to do such a thing. Even now, the strange symbol on the hilt was continuing to glow in and out.

"No, that shouldn't be the case. That black sword was a gift from Longblade, but that guy said he didn't really know where it had come from." Logan answered the question. He had only been aware that it could absorb energies, but now that he saw it display so much power, Logan was dying to inspect the weapon in detail.

Although many in the crowd were happy that Layla was finally able to do something, those close to her were concerned as she continued to wince. Unbeknownst to them, her head was bursting with cries and screams of what she could only describe as 'the damned'. They wouldn't stop in Layla's head.

'A small drawback for using me, but if you want to win this fight, then you'll have to endure this much.' The voice resonated inside her.

Her legs continued to move, but Layla wasn't the one who told them to do so. The strange energy that had inhabited her body was controlling it now. She felt in control, but at the same time not, as if someone was giving her orders of what to do, leaving her with little choice but to comply.

At that moment, seeing this, Dalki Helen stomped her foot on the ground. The whole area started to rumble before around thirty of the strange Dalki vine-like hands burst out and were moving about in the air.

"I thought as much." Vincent's eyebrows furrowed, seeing this. "She was holding back the entire time. I wonder if we had continued marching towards the fortress, if we would all be dead right now."

"You might be right in that assessment, but doesn't that warrant another question?" Logan replied. "Why would a Dalki do such a thing? She said she wanted to minimise the casualties… But then why did she want to be entertained by this fight? Shouldn't she have just gone and finished her off?"

The vine arms started to attack, all going towards Layla, but holding the black sword in her hand carefully, the Hannya looked like she was prepared for what was to come. The first vein was sliced at the top, and spinning the sword it shredded through another.

Jumping back at the right time, Layla avoided another blow, and jumped spinning backwards while using her sword to hit another three vines that came at once. As soon as she landed on the ground, she began to run forward and sliced one of the vines right down the middle and continued onward.

Opening her mouth, she blew flames everywhere, covering the area. The others could just see a shadow continuing to fight, and smoke soon after, making it hard to see where the others were.

'It's been such a long time since I was allowed to come out, and you've got such a great body, it's versatile in its skills and strengths!' The sword praised her, only to complain the next second. 'With all these prerequisites… why are you so weak? Why are you hesitating to cut her down? Why didn't you make full use of your powers?'

Jumping through the flames, for the first time, shooting out of her mouth was a black ball. It came out far faster than any of the others before. What's more, in succession, five more were shot out. Each time it hit Dalki Helen, it would unleash a chain of shadows attaching it to the ground, pinning her down.

Still, Helen was able to move through it all, yet the shadow balls continued to come, and as quickly as she was breaking it, more were being unleashed from Layla's mouth restraining the humanoid Dalki more and more.

'You shouldn't have underestimated me. I'm a sword that can cut through anything and I'm a sword that cannot break. You should have won with me alone. As long as you can keep your target still, all you have to do is cut her and you will always win.' The sword whispered to Layla.

She could feel what the sword was doing, using her subclasses' power to consume the negative emotions from within and those around, to produce the constant stream of Spiritual Chains that were keeping her opponent locked down.

Layla thought that since Dalki Helen could break them anyway, this tactic would be useless. Even if she hit Helen, the sword wouldn't pierce through her skin, but the sword had just proven her assumptions completely wrong.

Standing right in front of Dalki Helen, the sword thrust right through the Dalki's chest, twisting it in place. At the same time, the power had stopped there, and the screams had disappeared from her head. Now all she could see was the humanoid Dalki looking at her. The black colour in her eyes was fading, making her look even more human.

"Well… Layla… it looks like… you managed to win… this time. I hope… you finally confessed… to Quinn… and I hope… he is doing well… even after… what happened to… me." Helen spoke with difficulty. Right now, it didn't feel like Layla was killing a Dalki version of Helen. Hearing her speak like that, it felt like she was the real one.

"Depending on when and how the cloning process was done in the extraction. The Dalki might have all the memories of the original." Logan explained. "I saw some instances of this happening during the fight… but I was unsure. I think… this Dalki must have gained the memories for Helen a long time ago. Something that was out of expectation for Graham."

"You finally… grew up… to be… really strong… just like… I knew… you would." Dalki Helen continued, as blood still poured out from her mouth.

Tears were coming down Layla's face as she shook her head.

"No… it wasn't me." Layla admitted, tears rolling down her face. "I-I… left you back there… I should have stayed and helped you fight…I-I'm not the person you think I am."

What was making Layla feel even guiltier was the fact it hadn't been her own power that had defeated Helen. Once again she had lost, even with the use of her soul weapon.

"Don't be… stupid." Helen said, wiping away a tear from the other's face as she walked backwards, forcing the black sword out of her body. "As promised… I will… get rid… of all… the Dalki here."

Turning around, Helen looked at the base, and stomped on the ground once more. Several of the vine-like structures surrounded the base, and the next second, the humanoid Dalki had leaped up towards the fortress.

"NOOOO!" Layla screamed again, yet before she could take a single step, she collapsed onto the ground.

# Chapter 1539 - Her last Gift

The whole attack force was still quite a ways from the fortress, but they were able to see everything that was going on, and hear the noise that was happening inside. Not too long ago, they had seen the very Dalki Helen that they were all frightened to face with their lives, turn around and attack its own fortress.

The strange vine-like arms had all appeared in the fortress, and even now from a distance they could see Dalki being held up, their bodies pierced through and being chucked apart. A large explosion of power happened all at once as the Dalki were being destroyed. The next second, part of the fortress wall exploded and went flying, landing on the planet's surface.

Quickly, the others went to Sam, who was no longer trapped by a vine. The tactician rushed back to the others while also picking up Layla's disfigured arm. Since it was still in one piece and not too much time had passed, they should be able to reattach it with little difficulty.

Maybe even her green flames could do the job. As he returned, though, it turned out that the others were just as confused as him with what was going on. Layla was no longer in her True Hannya form. Due to all the Qi that had taken over her body, or perhaps as a drawback for staying in that form for too long, she wasn't even conscious at the moment.

"So you're telling me that Helen… I mean, the Humanoid Dalki just started to attack its own people because Layla defeated her in a duel?" Sam asked, to which he had a few people shrug their shoulders with relief on their faces.

"I think I might have some explanation for all of this." Logan chimed in. "The New Gen Dalki, I don't believe it is just referring to the humanoid Dalki we have seen, but also the three and four spikes. From the information I have gathered from the others. They didn't evolve into these spikes but were born this way.

"The humanoid Dalki are something different. Perhaps even an experiment on Graham's personal behalf. I doubt he was quite sure of the results himself, though. What has been created is something more on the lines of Borden. However, I imagine when creating such a Dalki he chose to omit memories, or perhaps even chose only selected memories.

"In a way, one could even brainwash a Dalki before they were even made to know that the humans are the enemy. However, such a process is not only very delicate and difficult, there's also no way to tell which memories have been erased and which ones might only have been suppressed. From the looks of it, Helen was a case of the latter.

"Fighting Layla might have triggered those memories in her. I'm not sure if Graham knew about that risk, or if they just cost too much to make, but I guess there's a reason why we haven't seen too many of them appear. In case something like this happened."

There was silence from the leaders that needed to make a decision on what to do next. Even now, the fight in the fortress seemed to be ongoing. However, at that moment, having received medical aid, Layla came to again.

"If she has her memories, then she's as real as the actual Helen to me… she knew about Quinn. She did all of this for us!" The young woman said, seemingly having heard everything they had talked about. She used her sword to hold herself up, still too weak to walk. "We have to at least help her to take down the fortress. No, before that, we have to heal her!"

The part about joining the attack, Sam certainly agreed with. As for helping her…

"I'm not so sure." Logan seemed against the idea. "She might look like Helen, and even have her memories, but I'm sorry, she's just a clone. We also don't know what Graham did when creating the humanoid Dalki, and without the data, we can't be sure she won't turn on us.

"When watching your fight, there seemed to be a trigger. Probably when you mentioned Quinn. Perhaps, while she is in control, this is what she has decided to do. However, can you guarantee that she won't change her mind?"

Although what Logan might have said was true, it looked like those in the Daisy faction had heard enough, and were already prepared to charge forward. The only thing was, just as they were about to, the commotion inside the fortress had come to a complete halt.

Seeing this, it looked like the group were on the move. Vincent, carried Layla on his back. While Dennis, and all those that were faster, including the vampires, ran ahead of the others. They were a little worried that the strange vines would pop out of the ground suddenly, but they never did.

When they finally reached the fortress, Vincent placed Layla down on the ground. They could see that the gates had been completely destroyed and taking a step inside it looked like everything else had as well.

The fortress had around a hundred Dalki, a mix of three and four spikes, yet none of them felt any signs of life inside. Blood splattered, holes and missing limbs of the Dalki. It had been a one-sided fight, that was for sure.

Eventually, after going through a few of the streets they had arrived at the centre, a square where the base would be used, and they could see a humanoid Dalki standing there in the centre. Her whole body, from head to toe, was bathed in green blood.

The figure looked out of sight, yet at the same time, there didn't seem to be a single mark on her apart from her chest. Eventually, Layla swivelled around to the side, and could see Helen standing there. A smile on her face. Only she might know what she had been looking at, and what her last thoughts had been… before her death.

She had died, but not before killing all the Dalki, and had died on her two feet standing.

"I didn't just kill Helen once…I killed her twice!" Layla punched the ground again and again, weeping. She couldn't stop her tears. Eventually, the rest of the Daisy faction and others entered the fortress. As they did, they all could see what Layla was crying over.

Peach went and carried Ivy over to her sister's body and placed her on the ground, and at that moment, everyone knelt down, paying their respects to the Daisy sisters.

They didn't get the chance to say their goodbyes the first time, but this time they could say goodbye to her properly. Even after death, even if this wasn't the real one. Many of their lives were saved after the Dalki attack.

Sam left the others to their goodbyes, many of the girls couldn't stop crying due to what happened, but he knew that as the leader he needed to decide on the best course of action. At the same time looking at the scene he had a thought in his head.

'A five spiked humanoid Dalki was able to take out one of these fortresses all on her own… in an injured state no less… it really is a scary thing… yet the latest report said that Graham was already a six spike...'

Entering one of the areas in the fortress that was somewhat still standing, Sam was having a meeting with the others, though Layla was unsurprisingly mentally absent.

"The fortress has been taken over, and we have managed to do so without losing our people. The Dalki no longer have any forces to rely on to support the main base. I've decided, as long as you agree to this.

"Layla, you've proven yourself as one of our strongest assets today. I don't know what happened, and you don't have to explain to me, but I think the others can do it with your help. You head over and join the Demon tier team. Take them out, destroy the Dalki main base, and get rid of any chance of them creating any monsters like this again.

"We need our strongest people to accomplish this task. I also want you to take Logan with you. He can gather information from the lab, and might be able to take it down without you guys even destroying the thing.

"As for me, Vincent, and Dennis. Us three will head back to the vampire settlement. We will get rid of the last attack force, and wherever Graham appears, we will be ready!"

Although Layla's mind was still elsewhere, she had heard everything that Sam had said. She wasn't too sure she was the right person for the job, but since their tactician deemed this to be the best, the Hannya agreed for now.

Looking at the sword, though, she could see it was no longer glowing.

'What happened back there?' Layla thought.
