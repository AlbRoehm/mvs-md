# Chapter 1860: The Legendary Blind swordsman. (Part 4)

This time, the Tunnel of flames which Erin had produced was massive. It touched the ground, the ceiling, and the side and was almost like a huge wall that was coming forward to swallow Silver, and because of this, she knew she had nowhere to run.

At the same time, although the attack was called a tunnel strike, it wasn't that at all. It was more like a solid pillar of flames was coming right towards her, and there was no escaping this. Ultimately, she did what she could, gathered all her aura, and hoped for the best.

Seeing this, Leo didn't hesitate, and while his mind raced with several thoughts, he moved immediately from his spot, straight towards the flames.

"What have I done? I don't usually act like this. "Leo thought.

"I know the risks. I knew what Erin could have possibly become, so then why didn't I just finish her off when I had the chance? Why did I try to teach her like it was a lesson? Why was I foolish to think she could still return to the way she was?

"And now, because of that, someone I deeply care about as well is about to get hurt, but I will not let this happen.

Immediately, Leo gathered all the Qi on his right leg. It was too much for his leg to handle, but he didn't care. And the moment his leg touched the ground again, it burst with power and broke part of the surface beneath him. At the same time, the skin over his entire calf muscles ripped apart, and blood trickled out.

The balance that Leo had previously perfected, he ignored all his own rules at this point. He didn't care if he couldn't walk after this. He just needed to reach the flames before they reached Silver. And in the next moment, Leo's chest began to slow as he summoned his soul weapon.

"I haven't been able to perfect this just yet, and I certainly have never used this on an attack this powerful, but it has to work.

Using his ability and soul weapon, Leo could change the flow of his opponents energy to r change the direction of their attack to deflect it. The stronger the enemy's attack, the more MC cells he needed to use his ability.

However, he had recently been trying to not just change the direction of certain attacks, such as movements, but also the flow of energy in the MC cells as well.

Using everything he could, Leo now was planning to do just that.

"Move to the right! "He shouted.

Silver did as she was told and ran as fast as she could. It was then that Leo drew the fire and could see it deflect slightly, but it wouldn't be enough.

"Moving it away in a different direction will take too many MC cells, and then I won't have any left. But if I move it toward myself, that requires less and less control. So I just have to do that. "Leo thought.

He continued to move towards the flames and changed it toward himself rather than away. And as he did, the Tunnel had a drastic change. Leo then thrust his sword forward and gathered his blood aura, his Qi, and everything he had to clash against the attack.

He was twirling the flames around his sword while using every ounce of energy to get rid of the flames as much as possible. However, this didn't seem like it would be enough. but he soon started to get some outside help, as Chris was choking out his third stage of Qi as much as possible to help Leo get rid of the flames.

It finally looked like his plan was working out, as the flames from the demon tier weapon were decreasing with every passing moment, and, eventually, the Tunnel was about to come to a halt.

"You fool! "Suddenly, A voice in Leo's head shouted. It was Ovnick, Leo's familiar. "You used up all of your Qi! I told you we need that... now I'm afraid I can't help you stop this one.

Leo was confused about what the familiar was talking about when he soon felt a sharp pain right through his back. The flames were no more, but looking down, he saw a tip of a katana-like blade, covered in his blood coming out of his stomach.

Erin had attacked him from behind!

At the same time, she also added Qi to this attack. Since Leo used it all on his spirit weapon to get rid of the flames as he ran as fast as he could to where Silver was, which meant that his vampire healing ability was now ineffective.

Pulling the blade out, Erin jumped back and switched to her Demon tier weapon.

"LEO! "Two people screamed at the same time.

They were Chris and Silver, and both of them panicked when they saw the destroyed leg that Leo could barely stand on, a severe wound that wouldn't stop bleeding.

It was the weakest that either of them had ever seen Leo at, and of course, the two of them would help no matter how they could.

But just then, the third ring on Erin's demon tier weapon lit up. This was a skill she had yet to use. With the click of her weapon, a giant ice wall instantly formed, blocking the side that Chris and Silver were on. She then twisted the handle and activated the other demon tier weapons trait, and instantly, the attachment type changed her blade to now have flame properties, and each of the skills was on a different cool down compared to the ice part of the weapon.

The third ring lit up again, and as soon as she slashed out her sword once again, a large flame wall appeared.

Chris didn't care and was ready to throw a punch at the ice wall to break through.

"No! "Zero shouted. "I do not want to lose you as well in this fight! This wall will redirect any attack you use, the only thing you can do is to wait for it to disappear. Then we can charge in and attack.

"You think this wall can hold me back?! "Chris shouted as he went to throw out a fist again. However, this time, Zero stood in front of Chris and used his own Qi to grab his fist before it could hit the wall.

Just then, Leo shouted from the other side of the wall.

"DON'T YOU DARE DIE! I am saying this to both of you. You both must get away from here and live!

Just when he had finished his words, Erin charged forward and once again stabbed Leo in the stomach. He grunted in pain as his hands felt weak, and he dropped the blade to the ground.

"Run! Please, I wish both of you... live a good life. "Leo tried to get a hold of himself and grabbed the sword with both hands, stopping it from going in any further. "Don't make the same mistake I did.

He sensed he could still use a flicker of his ability, and he could see the energy in front of him had not flickered for even a moment as she tried to kill him. In his last moments, this showed that even after all the time that they had spent together, Erin didn't care for him a single bit.

She used her strength to pull the blade and instantly sliced Leo's hands up. Blood sprinkled on the ground, and he fell to his knees.

"With this, I have finally completed my revenge, but this is only the beginning, "Erin shouted. At that moment, both the walls went down the flames and the Ice. And when Chris and Silver saw Leo's state, they were too stunned to even act.

"Obey Leo's wishes, get out of here and live. His death hurts me just as much as it does you, but I promise, if all works out, we will see Leo once again someday. "Zero vowed. At that moment, Chris was hesitant. He could see Leo right there, and with the help of third stage Qi, maybe he could do something, but how will he stop her? Erin looked in a powerful state, and as for Leo... he was on his dying breath.

Chris was conflicted with all the thoughts he had in his head, but it was too late by the time he made up his mind as he saw Erin stab her blade right through the top of his head, and it pierced right through Leo's heart.

After a moment, Silver's face paled as she could no longer hear his heartbeat.

***

# Chapter 1861: Heartbroken. (Part 1)

The scene that Chris saw replayed in his head again and again. Erin's sword had gone through Leo's head from the top down. He wasn't sure if he was imagining it or not, but everyone at the scene heard the sound of the sword going right through his skull, and at that moment, everything inside him seemed to break.

"ARGHHHH! "Chris screamed at the top of his lungs, and his whole body started to turn red as he activated the special soul weapon that was created by the members of Pure. He raised his hand and fired off the third stage Qi after gathering it around his palm.

Erin quickly pulled the blade out of Leo's head, allowing his body to fall lifeless to the floor, and placed it away as she held the demon-tier weapon. Holding it against her body and activating its ice proxies, she created a type of barrier. The large blast hit her and caused her to skid across the floor.

Chris continued to gather out his Qi as he was going to fire out the third stage through the air, aiming to at least hurt Erin for now.

"If Leo could push her this far, then I can do something as well. "Chris thought.

At the same time, she had just had a fight, so surely she was more tired than him.

However, before Chris could attack further, his hand was knocked up, and a heavy palm strike hit him right in the stomach, sending him across the floor and forcing him to fall to his knees to balance himself. There was a hand imprint left on his stomach, and Chris gasped for air.

His red skin also started to fade as it went back to its usual colour, something that Chris had never experienced before.

"What is this? The energy is draining from my body. Is it a type of technique? Of course, of course, Zero would keep something to himself so that he can be in charge of everyone else.

"Will you listen to me! "Zero shouted just then. "I do not want to lose you as well. You will get us all killed!

Erin, having survived the attacks, looked at Leo one last time, and she also looked towards Silver. Unfortunately, due to Leo now being gone, the rising energy of the dhampir that was in her was starting to fade.

It would be more difficult for her to face the other two and the vampire. This was why it was always best for her to kill the weaker vampires in a group first, only this time, she had no choice.

"I will come back someday, "Erin declared and went to the edge of the platform. Someone else also appeared by her side, the young woman that Silver was fighting against. Silver was distracted due to the shock of Leo's death, and seeing the opportunity, the young woman avoided the attack and escaped.

The two of them then jumped backwards off the platform and into the sea, only they hadn't gone into the sea and instead landed on top of a ship that was seen flying off into the distance far away.

Rather than going to give chase after Erin, instead, Silver had gone over to Leo's side.

"Leo! Leo! "Silver shouted as she knelt down and brought his head into his lap. She looked at the blood pouring down his face and his whitened-out eyes. Images of the few meetings the two had together were flashing into her mind, and she began to rock back and forth, screaming at the top of her lungs.

"WHY NOW?! WHY?!

These were the only words that she repeatedly said as she pulled Leo's head closer into a hug, and she cried in regret and mourning.

Chris had managed to regain his breath back, but he was no longer filled with anger. Now that Erin was gone, there was nothing he could do at this moment, and looking at both Silver and Leo like so, the immense pain he had ever felt in his heart before had appeared.

Read on www.Allno vel full. com , Please!

He felt a heavy lump in his throat that he was finding incredibly hard to keep down.

"If I had just... gone in earlier... if I had gone to help instead of thinking too much, "Chris regretted his hesitation. "Why am I so useless? Why didn't I help him?

The sound of footsteps was coming toward him, and Chris could hear them as he looked up.

"I know why I hesitated, "Chris said, furrowing his eyebrows. "It was because of you. You were the one that stopped me! You stopped me from helping him! You said you cared about Leo. What bullshit was that then?

"You, buying up this army, growing as strong as you could and for what?! You couldn't even protect the people you care about, and now you couldn't even protect Leo either!

Lifting his hand, Zero slapped Chris right across the face.

"You have no idea, "Zero said with a shaky voice, and when looking at him closely, that's when Chris noticed that Zero was also crying uncontrollably, tears down his entire face. "You have no idea how I feel. So don't you dare go on and talk like you know everything.

"Every single person I have raised, I see them as my sons and daughters. I have stronger bonds with them, even when compared to their real families, and the same goes for you as well.

"I could see Leo was already lost, but Chris, I couldn't lose you as well. If I lost you, then it would mean I have absolutely no one. No one left in this world.

Being raised by Zero, Chris was always thankful to him and felt indebted, and because of that, he did everything that he was asked to, but even after years, he never felt the true family connection. It was only while spending time with Leo did he feel like he finally had a place and someone he could depend on.

For the first time, seeing Zero break down in front of him like this, the connection between the two of them was felt.

Eventually, Zero wiped away his tears and turned around away from Chris for a few seconds. It was almost as if he was trying to regain his composure, and when that was finally done, he turned around and went at eye level with Chris, pulling his shoulders in so the two of them were closer.

"I know you, Chris, you are kind-hearted, you are like me, that's why I chose you. You saw Leo like a brother, correct?

Chris was too hurt to say anything. If he even spoke, then all of the emotions he was keeping welled up would come out, so he just nodded instead.

"Good, so listen to me, "Zero said as he shook Chris. "The two of us only have each other in this world now. We have to continue with the plan. Do you remember what I asked before? Do you recall what I told you?

Chris shook his head because he wasn't really sure what part Zero was talking about.

"I have gathered the members of Pure again. We can change this world, so things like this never happen again, so there are people who don't have to experience the same pain that the two of us are feeling right now!

High on emotions and sadness and not sure what to do, Chris just nodded along. Right now, he has nobody. The only two people he really knew his entire life were Zero and Leo. Now with Leo gone, he had no choice but to go back to the only other one that had cared about him.

Lastly, this way, his life would have some use, he could be useful to someone, and he could experience what life was like in a family.

"Just remember, Chris, "Zero said as he clenched his fists. "Everything we are doing is for them. Everything we are doing is to get them back, and now, Leo is just added on that list as well.

***

# Chapter 1962: Heartbroken. (Part 2)

By the time Chris finished recounting his story, the mood had turned heavy, and the others were left in a heavy silence. At first, some of them believed that the whole story was made up, an elaborate plan to fool them into believing that Chris truly wanted to go against Zero.

However, as the story went on, it was harder and harder for Chris to even speak properly. His voice was shaken, his eyes were teary, and he had even passed a few moments. It was as if he was reliving those days all over again.

Technically, for Chris, all of this had happened a long time ago, and yet, he hadn't forgotten any of it. Not a single detail of what had transpired. At the same time, the others had gotten what they asked for, to find out the truth of what had happened between Erin and Leo that day.

"Wahhhh! "A loud cry began coming from Minny of all people. "This... this is so sad! The pretty girl and the blind man were meant to get together. They finally... they finally...told each other they liked each other.

Minny couldn't hold in her sadness, but what she said was true, and the others felt the same way. Fate had been utterly cruel to all three of them. For Peter, though, this had hurt him quite a bit. Emotions that he didn't think he had were starting to resurface inside of him.

"Erin... is this really the same Erin as before? We... did so much for her... and Leo did so much for her. So how the f*ck could she be so heartless and do something like that? None of that story made any sense.

Hearing Minny cry, Lucia was also interested in one aspect of the story.

"After... what happened to Silver after Leo's death? "Lucia asked.

The story was like a TV drama series they were watching, but just like in a TV series, there were a lot of loose ends that they needed to find out about.

"I... didn't join Zero straight away, "Chris answered. "My heart ached too much. I knew that whatever he needed me to do, I wasn't ready for it. I think he knew that as well and that I would seek him out when I felt better.

"Instead, I stayed with what was left of Leo and Silver. She stayed with Leo's lifeless body in her arms for an entire day. The other vampires that we were meant to be protecting had returned and showed their respects and needed someone to help them.

"I helped them, thinking that maybe that's what Leo would have wanted me to do. After connecting them back with the vampire soldiers and giving them safe passage, I returned, and Silver was still there like a statue, not having moved for a long time.

"In the end, I said that it would be best if we buried Leo to allow him to rest in peace, and she agreed. t She said that there was often a planet, a shelter that Leo would talk about. One where he spent most of his time.

"A shelter that was privately funded by him for years and years to come, but if the two of them were to really get together and retire, she imagined it would have been there. It was a good place to pick, and I understood why Leo loved such a place when I reached there. It was so peaceful, with a calm river nearby the Shelter.

"Even the people were cheerful. It was as if they were away from everything, all the conflict and trouble. After that, we both bid farewell to each other, and that was the last time I saw Silver. I have no clue where she went and how she is. I don't even know if she's even alive.

By now, all the girls in the room had tears in their eyes. They couldn't even imagine what it was like to love someone so much that after losing them, they never wanted to leave their side, not even for a second, even in their death.

"I did not know this, "Muka sighed.

Read on www.Allno vel full. com , Please!

"I actually know what happened to Silver later on. At the time, the vampire settlement was still active. We were struggling to function properly since we were unable to elect a leader, but things were still going okay.

"Silver had returned to the vampire settlement. She didn't say a word to anyone. Not to her brother, me or any of the other leaders, and at the time, had just gone into an Eternal slumber.

"She chose that if she couldn't live with the man she loved, then there was no point in continuing her life anyway, "Jessica mumbled.

"When someone loses someone dear to them, people react in different ways, "Muka explaine.

"Some let anger take over and go for revenge. Others try to replace that deep missing part of their heart, to try to heal the wounds, and others decide... well, we know what happened to Silver.

The group had learned the entire truth of the Erin and Leo saga, and it seemed like what Chris had told Quinn had matched up, but there was something that didn't match up.

"Why did Erin kill Leo? "Peter blurted out loud. "My head hurts every time I try to think about it, but why? It makes no sense.

"You are right, "Jessica replied with her finger on her chin. "From what you and Quinn have said, Erin was Leo's student for a very long time. She was part of your group until the Dhampir urges began to take her over.

"Yet, we learnt from the Dhampirs that they have long since been able to control their urge to kill, and that was thanks to Erin herself. Did she still have the urge back then? Could she not control it?

Listening to this had propped up Chris to listen in more because he had never thought about this. Chris didn't know much about the relationship between Leo and Erin. He had learnt a few things here and there from Leo but just assumed at some point they had become enemies for one reason or another.

"If you ask me... it seemed like she already had it under control, "Chris answered. "Although she was acting on emotion, it wasn't as if there was something in her body controlling her. Back then, I had a strong understanding of energies and Qi, and although I never learned the ability Leo had, I learnt to sense it. To me, the vibe and energy that she was giving off was pure anger.

"She truly seemed like she hated him from the comments after she killed him. For one reason or another, she has a deep hatred against vampires.

"Maybe something happened to her, "Mitchell added. "Between the time that she left Leo and met up with the two of you. There is a lot that could happen in that time, and the cause of it could have been a vampire.

"To build up hatred that strong? "Peter replied back. "I don't buy it. Maybe you guys don't understand, but the two of them were like father and daughter. Let's say a vampire killed a friend she made or something. That still wouldn't explain why she had acted in such a way if it wasn't the urge.

The whole group was left at a standstill. They felt like they weren't in a better situation to understand Erin compared to before. Either way, they would pass this information to Layla and see what she thought about the whole thing. Telling Quinn would be difficult as well because Peter knew that after hearing how Erin had treated Leo, Quinn wouldn't care what happened and would take her out.

"Thank you for sharing your whole story with us, "Muka said.

"But there is still one thing that doesn't make sense, and that is you. I can understand why you went back to Zero after all this time, but then why now, after all these years, have you decided to go against Zero?

Clenching his fist, Chris gave an answer.

"Because right now, Zero is working with the one person I could never ever forgive. The reason why Zero isn't here is that he is working with Erin to take down Green city.

***

# Chapter ﻿1863: Take down the ship (Part 1)

Everything that Chris said seemed more probable after hearing those words. Pure always had good relations with the Dhampirs, and with the latter's forces incredibly weakened, they needed to hide behind someone's back, and without a doubt, Pure was a good option for them.

At the same time, it explained why Zero wasn't currently on this base. And this also revealed a good reason why Chris wanted to betray Zero because Erin had beheaded the one person he had cared for, and now, She and Zero were working together even though the latter promised him revenge.

However, despite all of this, it was still hard for Muka to believe that they weren't walking into a trap, and she wanted to inquire about a few more important things.

"If you really wish to work with us, then you must answer the next few questions I will ask. Then, if I am satisfied with the replies, our group will agree to work with yours." She said,

It was natural for her to doubt Chris, and the others were quite apprehensive against the latter as well. After a moment of thought, Chris nodded, indicating to her to fire away the questions she had in her mind.

"Where are Zero and Erin as we speak? And what are they planning?"

"A planet was discovered with multiple Demon tier beasts. It's impossible for many to even survive in such a place. Still, they plan to work together and bring back as many Demon-tier crystals as possible, not only for themselves but also for those working under them. I hope I don't need to tell you what they plan to do with them." Chris answered.

Muka and Peter knew what Chris was talking about, and the others could tell from the story they heard. Depending on the Demon tier crystals, one could gain powerful Demon tier weapons. Not long ago, they had a first-hand experience of how strong Erin's current demon tier weapon was, and just the thought of her having more such gave all of them a headache.

At the same time, if there were enough of those crystals, then Zero could arm all the high-ranking Pure agents with the said weapons as well.

"What is Zero's true goal in all of this? You mentioned he talked about bringing the others back. Does that have something to do with all of this?" Muka asked.

Chris didn't answer this question straight away. It made Muka doubt that he might be trying to come up with a lie, but in the end, he gave the best possible answer he could.

"I don't know his ultimate goal, but I do know what he has recently done. He was focused on gaining as much energy as possible. So the slaves Pure has been buying, Zero was using his ability of Qi drain on them to add the power to his own. He has continued to do this for years, and it's one of the other things he has done that I can't agree with.

"And he's not just after the lives of others. He also strongly desired to get his hands on the Red Heart because it would be a purer source of energy, like nest crystals. And I'll be honest, it seems like he is not following his own plan but rather someone else's, but I don't know any more about this, and the last part is just my own suspicion, I don't have any proof of that."

This revelation came as a surprise to them. Zero was at the top of the food chain, so who would follow someone else's orders? Did the guy just go crazy over the last millennia, or was it perhaps something else? When Muka thought about it more, she came to one conclusion.

"He kept talking about bringing them back right, and you said he's following someone's orders. So maybe whoever he listens to has promised to bring them back?" Muka said out loud.

It was then that Chris's eyes lit up. He had been so close to Zero this whole time, yet the thought had never crossed his mind. It explained a lot of what he had heard and seen.

"Bring the dead back, but is that even possible?" Jessica asked.

"It doesn't matter," Chris answered. "All of Zero's feelings were true. It was all true when he said he cared for his students like they were sons or part of his family. So if someone told him they could bring them back, Zero would do anything, blinded by everything.

"What I'm wondering now though, is what does this other person want."

No one had an answer for that, so Muka decided to continue with her questions.

"You have Werewolf DNA inside you. Quinn confirmed that. The only people with Werewolf DNA were the vampire settlement. I remember the DNA was stored in the lab. Does that mean Pure is the one that was behind the vampire settlement attack? Do they currently have the missing tombs?"

When asking this question, Muka's voice contained frustration and rage because those tombs were very important to her and something she wanted to find out dearly. The old vampires, the originals who were still alive and their ancestors, needed to be respected.

"No," Chris answered. "At least, I don't think I know the answer. First, if Zero had the tombs, the only place he would keep them without worrying about them would be on this ship. However, I have never seen any tomb, and if you really wish, you can search this place from top to bottom for them.

"The reason why I'm saying I don't know though, is because Zero was the one that had the DNA. Pure had come across some files that were originally shared with us. They had details about how to mix humans along with beasts.

"There were problems at first, but with the help of the Bree family's ability, we succeeded in creating mixes that we could control. In the end, we had somewhat perfected this technique. Zero was the one who found the Werewolf DNA, although I have no clue from where. All I know is that it was not long after the initial contact with the dhampirs."

There were some suspicions in Muka's mind that the vampire settlement would have been attacked by them, but they weren't an established organisation. They didn't even have a base of sorts because they were always on the move.

Maybe that's why the tombs were spread all over the place? It just meant that for Muka to get her answer, she would have to get it from Erin herself.

"I promise you, my hatred for Zero grows as I think about everything he has done," Chris added. "Zero used me as an experiment. He turned me into this but did no such thing himself. I fell for his act, I was a fool to believe his words when he said he cared about me, but actions speak louder than words.

"It just took me a 1000 years to realise it."

The others felt quite sorry for Chris. They could realise, in some ways, as many of them in their own lives had felt like outcasts at one point and time. The only thing was many of them found each other and Quinn.

While Chris had found Zero, who took him down the wrong path.

"Let's work with him!" Minny shouted with a big smile. "I like him. He can be my Big Uncle or Muscle Uncle!"

Seeing Minny act like this and say those words, a smile formed on Chris' face.

"Alright, I have decided that we will work together. So the first thing I would ask is, what is your plan to stop Zero and Pure?"

Getting up from his seat, Chris walked past the table and to the other side of the room.

"That...the plan is quite simple. The Red Heart is still located here on this ship. We take it back. I think it's a lot safer in your hands than it is in his.

"Then the next part starts from here today and now. Destroy the lab, destroy the military facilities, and destroy everything that makes Pure a strong powerhouse. Right now, Zero is away, and the second strongest in Pure has decided to join your side, so what better time than now to cause some mayhem."

The others looked at each other, remembering Logan's words. That this was meant to just be a meeting, that they weren't to cause any trouble. However, the situation was something none of them had expected, and in unexpected times, sometimes they just had to go with their gut.

"Let's destroy this ship!" Peter smiled.

*****

# Chapter ﻿1864: Take down the ship (Part 2)

Almost everyone who had come with Muka felt their heart beating slightly faster than before. They wondered if they were really going to go through with it, and when Peter, Muka and Chris began to prepare and discuss the plan, it seemed like it was the case.

Previously they had taken a very cautious and defensive approach, however, now, the representatives of the Green family would be the aggressors.

"Don't worry. If all works out well, then it will mean that Pure will have no forces to stand on." Chris explained. "On top of that, I will become the big bad wolf. There will be no one to blame the Green family. I just need you guys to keep the heart and make sure Zero never gets his hands on it again."

Chris walked up to the elevator door and was ready to push the button. The first place they would head to was the lab.

"What are you going to do?" Peter asked. "After this, attack. As you said, the people will hate you. They will think you betrayed them. It also means if Logan wants to win the people's trust, they can't take you in either."

Chris let out a big sigh and pressed the button.

"I've lived for too long anyway. Maybe I'll just rest after this."

All of them entered the elevator as they had done before, and with Chris's hand print, he had access to take them straight to the lab. It was the only place where the others hadn't gone during their tour.

The elevator moved fast, heading downward and quite deep towards the front of the ship. After a while, everyone heard a 'ding', and they stepped out of the lift, not wielding their weapons at first. The room they were in now was a giant lab full of several different pieces of equipment.

What was also surprising to them were the giant containers that were in place.

"This…reminds me of the vampire settlement," Muka commented.

This was because, in those giant glass containers that Pure had, there were the half-breed humanized beasts that Pure had been making. They never did stop with their trials. Some looked more beast than human, while a few looked complete human but had hollowed eyes.

"All of them have been drugged," Chris explained. "They probably don't even know where they are. This isn't something I wanted to show you, but it's the only way to get to the main lab."

As they walked through, Muka noted that the giant containers looked to hold about 100 people each, and there were 24 containers in total. Pure was experimenting on a lot of people, and she imagined each container was a different experiment.

"Sir 1!" A person in a lab coat greeted Chris. He looked to be writing notes while inspecting one of the giant containers. "What are you doing here?" The man started to walk towards the group and soon realized who Chris was with.

"Agent 1…why have you brought the guest down to the facility? Agent 4 stated under no circumstances were they to- "

The lab coat scientist's eyes suddenly started to turn white. It was as if they had rolled into the back of his head as he collapsed onto the floor and blood trickled out of his nose.

"Is he…dead," Lucia asked.

She didn't understand what had happened. The man was saying to them, and they didn't attack or take any action, but the next second he was suddenly on the floor, bleeding.

'"We can't allow them to raise an alarm. So if you want your people to live safely, we will have to take some drastic steps." Chris explained. "And trust me, these people in this lap aren't worth good people either."

Being the Top Agent and the second-in-command, Chris had access to everywhere, at least almost everywhere. He continued to walk ahead and kept pressing his hand and opening door after door as the group went through different parts of the lab.

Chris explained that the real action would begin once they got their hands on the Red Heart.

They would destroy the rest of the lab, and considering the numbers in the group, Chris knew it wouldn't take much time.

However, there was one door that Chris couldn't open. No matter how many times he placed his hand on the scanner, it wouldn't accept his handprint.

"Damn it. Looks like Agent Four never trusted anyone with his research. The Red Heart has to be in here." Chris frowned, "There's a change of plan. Everyone, let's split and head to the different parts of the lab.

"The second I destroy this door to get in, it will set off the alarm for the entire ship. So if there is one thing we need to do, it is to get rid of this lab."

Listening to Chris, everyone had split up. The lab was larger and split by several doors, but it should be possible with numbers and their strength. However, there was one person who had decided to stay with Chris, and that was Muka.

"EVERYONE READY!" Muka shouted. "1..2..3!"

Chris gathered his Qi and blasted a punch right at the door. It was blown outward, instantly destroying the reinforced door with ease. At the same time, lighting bolts, vampire aura, blood shots and more were all used to destroy the servers, the terminals, and all the equipment that was being used in the room.

Just like Chris said, alarms went off in the lab and throughout the entire ship, alerting all Agents and the army that the lab was under attack.

Agent 4's personal space was small compared to the rest of the rooms, but it had the top technology, one anyone would need to do their own research. Unfortunately however, it looked nothing like the last time Chris was inside.

"It's all gone," Chris was shocked. "Everything that was in here before, all of it is gone. None of the Vampire armour and the Red heart is here!"

A dreaded thought ran through Chris's mind at that point and time. What were they planning to do if Agent four took everything with him and went along with Zero? Why would they need the Red Heart?

Did this mean they had gathered enough energy for whatever they had planned?

'Did Zero even tell me the truth? Are they really on that planet in search of Demon-tier beasts? He wanted me to stay…so I couldn't stop him.'

The Pure army was rushing to the lab, heading from all over places, and the drills that the Pure had practised many times were coming into action. Most of the civilians stayed indoors or went to the pre-built shelters on the ship, which were reinforced areas designed for the people's safety.

On the outside of the ship, in the open fresh air, Agent 17 coordinated the Pure Army to also be on the lookout for any attacks coming from the outside. While standing on the deck and out to the edge though, they suddenly noticed something strange going on in the sky.

'Is that…thunder? But isn't it sunny today?' Everyone stared at the sky in confusion.

In the next second, a massive beam of white light shot out from the sky. It was tremendous and wide, far more expansive than the giant ship itself and blasted into the Ocean, causing huge waves around hundred meters to rise.

They came out fiercely as if the Ocean was angry and had hit the ship and pushed it onto its side. Everyone on board was being pushed, dangled and chucked all over the place. The small fleet of vessels that would protect the larger ship was destroyed by the precious waves.

Even Peter and the others had been knocked off their feet, sliding down, unsure what was happening. Chris jumped using the strength in his feet and slashed through all the metal of the ship. He easily made it to the top, only to see the large beam of white light hitting the Ocean.

"What is going on?" Chris wondered.

# Chapter ﻿1865 BB power

The Mermerial race was a race that traversed multiple planets, however all of the planets followed one leader, and news soon spread to all the other planets that the civil war that was going on between those known as the Predators and the old royal family had come to an end.

However, there were stories that were being spread about the appearance of the Mermerial god known as Yongu, and how another god had made him bow down. How the princess Wince had managed to get such a powerful god on her side, no one really knew, but that didn't stop rumors from being spread around.

Some were bad, stating that Wince seduced him with her looks, others thought that a deal was made that the Mermerial race would have to pay back in the future, while others were more tame.

The name BB was being spread around, as the name was pronounced out of the god Yongu's mouth himself. A god that actually came when there were troubles to right the wrongs of the world.

"Are you sure that's his name, the god BB. I mean, that doesn't really sound very menacing, does it?"

"The princess trusts him and so should we, but at the end of the day, what does a name matter?"

"Well, a name is spread far and wide. If a god has a fierce name, then they are more likely to respect him, without having the need for him to fight. Imagine if we didn't know of this before, and someone said the god BB is coming to attack, people would just laugh."

"Although what you say is true, perhaps that is because we don't know his name. Menacing names are created, rather than given. I'm pretty sure, the name of BB, might be spread far and wide in the universe in the future."

The main city that had been risen from the seafloor to the surface on a large block of ice had been kept floating on the water. The Hydro stations that had been there had mostly been destroyed, and it would be a while until they were repaired. At the same time, the Princess Wince wanted a place where Quinn could visit the city whenever he wished.

Since he had a fear of water, she believed this was the best thing to do. The city had mostly been rebuilt quite quickly. The Mermerials were a hard working race, and the royal army that had been captured and treated as slaves, as well as items from the Royal vault, had been used to rebuild the city.

Currently, Quinn, Sil, Wince, Yanny and Yongu were all in the same room in the Royal place. It was an office that was used to listen to the Councillor's and more. The Dalki had gone to stay with Nog for a while, on the request of Quinn.

He stated that he might need his help, and at first it didn't look like Dogthu would accept, but he said that he would but would like to meet him before he left, so the two of them could talk a bit more.

Dogthu, finding out that Quinn was some type of god, thought that it was certainly interesting.

In the Royal room, Yanny was standing behind Yongu silently, not saying a word.

In fact, he hadn't spoken much at all since his defeat from the princess and his plan had failed. It was almost as if he didn't have permission to speak unless he was spoken to.

"The city has been rebuilt, and reclaimed back thanks to your help Quinn, and of course you as well Yongu, you have helped out the people in these tough times." Wince explained. When looking at Yanny, she couldn't look at him longer than three seconds.

She still had the image of one of the predators killing her dear sister. Honestly she wanted to execute him on the spot, but she knew it was better to keep him alive, especially since Yongu was now working with them.

"I have called you all because Quinn, I know you will be leaving soon, Yongu has told me that the preparations to send you back to earth has been completed and as promised I wanted to give you an item from our Royal vault." Wince suggested.

Both Quinn and Sil looked at each other, because they had a conversation before about what to ask for, and it was sure to be a tough ask.

Holding up his hand Quinn started to speak.

"There is no need to bring out the items, I only have two requests. When asking about these things, I want you to know that both of them you can decline, do not accept just because I was the one that asked you.

"Out of all the items, we would like to have the trident. We understand that it originally belonged to your father, but it was a Royal vault item so we hope that is acceptable."

There was a pause from Wince for a few seconds, and without saying anything she had left the room, making it awkward for the rest. A few moments later the spear was in her hand. Walking over, she didn't hand it to Quinn though, she had handed it to Sil instead.

"I accept your request. Not just because I am indebted to you, but because I can tell. It tells me that it is better in your hands than mine." Wince smiled.

Sil, took the trident and placed it in his portal space, but of course he felt awkward. Before arriving, he and Quinn had talked about what to say. Sil had told Quinn that he really wanted the trident back, it was one of his favorite weapons and Wince didn't know how to use half the functions and draw out its power like he did.

Quinn had come up with a plan, but the real question was, would Sil have to tell the Princess the truth, that he was the one that had killed her father.

"Don't bring it up." was Quinn's answer. "In her mind, she has avenged her father. Beaten the one that had killed him. In a way, Yanny's life is in her hands. So telling her the truth will only upset her. Let her enjoy this moment."

It was hard to Say whether or not Sil agreed with it or not, but it was mainly because he would carry this burden with him, like many he had done during his years of traveling. In the end, he agreed to what Quinn had suggested because he didn't want to be selfish. There was such a sweet smile on Wince's face.

"And what is the second request?" Wince asked.

Quinn stood up from where he was, and for a second, Yongu flinched, his hand moved and was shaking slightly. His tentacles that covered his face were shaking.

"I would like to keep in contact with you and still be a part of all of this. One day, there might be a time when I need your help, maybe even something small as locating someone. In return though, I will give you some of my power." Quinn said, looking at his hand.

"Your…power..the power of the God BB!" Wince's eyes lit up, as she was excited more than anything.

"Please…don't call me that," Quinn replied.

"You can't BB!" Yongu stood up, but immediately, sat down and bowed his head. "I mean I would advise against you doing that BB. I am assuming wish to make her a dedicated follower. If that is the case then that means you will have someone that is not even in your territory.

"I am not the only god that governs this galaxy, or solar system. Some might even think you are trying to spread your influence by creating dedicated followers everywhere."

Quinn looked toward Yongu which made him flinch again, Yongu found it hard to look into Quinn's eyes.

"I assume you are the strongest god of this galaxy, am I correct?" Quinn asked.

Yongu nodded his head.

"Then there won't be a problem. The celestials can think what they want, but I have upset the balance in this place, the least I can do is take responsibility to help protect it. Of course, Yongu, you will be the first line of defense, correct?"

"Of course!" Yongu answered, hoping that a day like that would never have to come.

"So what do you say?" Quinn asked.

Immediately, the princess got down on one knee.

"I accept to be your dedicated follower."

Nervous and not wanting to say anything anymore, Yongu felt like he was in a difficult situation. He would try to keep this under wraps as much as possible, but if others found out about it, once again the Celestial known as BB would be causing an uproar, one that would involve the ancient ones no matter what.

# Chapter ﻿1866 Rejoin the others

Just like Quinn had done on the Amra planets, he wanted to do the same here for the Mermerial race. Although Quinn didn't believe it was his place to be involved in other's affairs, at the end of the day, he had already interfered.

This game of gods was turning out to be a lot more complicated than he initially thought and although Quinn still didn't have a set plan on how to protect Earth from these future threats, this was a start in his grand plan.

Placing his hand out, he touched the top of Wince's head that was still bowed down.

'The Amra race were able to take more celestial points than I thought. It might be the same here, the other races are naturally stronger compared to humans. The Amra had extraordinary bodies, and the Mermerials have the strong power to control water.'

The energy was being transferred into Wince and she could feel tingles all over her body. It was incomparable to anything she had felt before, as the cells all over her body vibrated with excitement. Her face was starting to turn red as pleasure was now felt over her body, and finally Quinn had lifted his hand, as it was over.

A mark started to appear, on Wince's upper thigh, on the outside. It was visible as she was wearing a sparkly blue dress with a slit where her legs were.

'It's as I thought… the races can take a lot more celestial points.' Quinn thought.

[A dedicated follower has been created]

[Wince: 1300 Celestial points]

Although Quinn could tell that Wince could take a few more celestial points, here and there, he decided to stay on a nice round number. After creating quite a few dedicated followers, Quinn had learned the limits that people could take.

It was almost like filling up a water bottle, he knew when it was close to the top, stopping just before it spilled over..

"The power you have now is similar to the power that Yongu gave to the predators. What you have might be a bit different though, as I am also different from him. I don't know what powers you will have, but it would be best if you use it wisely.

"In fact, I would say only use it when you really need to."

Wince smiled at this, she wanted to test her new powers but wouldn't do so in front of Quinn. She knew he was busy and must be anxious to leave this place, because after all, that was all that he had asked for this entire trip. She was happy that he was able to go home after this.

"Take this." Wince said, as she handed him over what looked like a shell. That was it, it didn't look special and it certainly wasn't a beast weapon of any kind. "This is a communication shell and I have one as well. No matter where you are, the two of us will be able to communicate."

This seemed handy to have, but it made Quinn wonder how it was even possible. Logan was unable to create such things with technology? Perhaps was it something similar to magic? It was clear that the Mermerials also didn't have any abilities other than controlling water. It just showed how vast the universe was and all of the powers that existed out there.

"Will you be leaving now?" Wince asked.

"Not yet, there is one more thing that I need to do. Do you mind coming with me?" Quinn asked.

It was a strange request but at this point, Wince was treating Quinn as her god, a person she needed to follow and comply with in order for her race to continue thriving.

Quinn had claimed that it was a private matter. They had travelled by a strange pod-like ship that the Mermerials used to travel on the surface of the sea. Everyone was there, but when they had reached the beach, he had told the rest to stay there, while only the two of them walked to the city.

'What…what does Quinn want, why is he walking me along the beach, and asking just for the two of us…it couldn't be, could he possibly be planning to..' Wince's face started to turn bright red, as she thought of the things Quinn might do.

"We are here." Quinn said.

Her hands covering her face, shaking her head from embarrassment, Wince had failed to see where they were at this moment and time. Lifting her head, she was left with her mouth wide open.

"But… but how?" Wince, eyes were filled with tears in an instant, her legs were shaking, and her vision was now blurry. The next moment, she started to run across the beach and with all her strength she leapt up, crashing into the other person and pinning them on the ground.

"This is real, you're alive, you're alive… but how?" Wince asked as she was now on top of her sister Ceril.

"I'm so sorry." Ceril eventually replied, wiping her own tears away from her face. "I'm so sorry, I got involved with the predators… it was me, it was my decision, but I want you to know that I would never betray you. I would have never done anything to hurt any of the Royal family, especially you big sis." It was hard for Ceril to speak, as she kept on gasping for air in-between her words, but every word that was said was true.

Embracing in a big hug, Wince wouldn't have even cared if she was under the control of the strange predators.

"I'm happy that the two of you are together," Quinn said approaching. Standing right next to Ceril was Dogthu and Nog.

The two of them were told to look after her by Quinn for the time being.

"Your sister, she has a lot to tell you, and I apologize in advance, but it was the only way I could save her." Quinn stated. "I will leave you two together."

Quinn walked off with Dogthu and Nog, allowing both Ceril and Wince to talk to each other and say their goodbyes. Because Quinn had turned Ceril into a new type of subspecies he couldn't risk leaving her here.

Ceril seemed to have understood and her wish was to explain to her sister and say her goodbyes, and would now travel with Quinn from now on. The same mistakes that appeared on earth, couldn't be repeated here, even if he had to break up a family, he would do so.

"I wanted to thank you for your help back there," Quinn said to the large Dalki. "I know you don't know much, but our two races had a Great War, but I had a Dalki friend. You remind me a lot of him. There are a lot of questions that I wanted to ask you.

"About whether there are more of you, how you got your powers, but I know that you won't be able to answer them. However, what I did want to say was, I hope that the two of us don't end up fighting in the future, like in the past."

Dogthu smiled, and turned around.

"Trust me, I don't want to fight someone like you. After seeing how much power you have… it would be a tough battle for us." Dogthu replied.

There wasn't much for them to say after that, and Wince had returned after a long talk, around an hour worth. She then came over to Quinn, held his hand, and said thank you.

"Thank you, I just wanted to say thank you, because of you, I have another chance to meet my sister again, and say thank you." Wince said.

After that, it was finally time for them all to leave. Everyone had gathered on the beach. They were ready and so was Yongu.

"Alright, first we need to enter my space, and then I will transport you to earth. My transportation skills are quite poor and for some reason, I always end up in the sea. I'm afraid there is no other option."

"Wait, the sea!" Quinn shouted.

Before he could say anything else, Yongu activated his white space and it was time to transport everyone back.

*****

# Chapter ﻿1867 Quinn is alive?

From the outside, an ample bright white light appeared in the shape of a large sphere, and it continued to enlarge until it had consumed Quinn, Sil, and Ceril as well. As soon as it reached them, all three suddenly disappeared, as if they were never there.

At the same time, it looked like Yongu and Yanny had also disappeared. With an agreement to never return to this planet again, of course, unless they came as an ally.

"Good luck, my dear sister. I can only imagine the number of stories you will have to tell me when you return." Wince said with a big smile on her face while looking up at the sky.

"What will you two do now? You are free to stay here for as long as you like since you have also played a crucial part in helping us reclaim our planet." Wince turned to her side.

"You really believe that?" Doguth replied. "Think back to what they did. Both of them. At any point and time, it felt like that guy named Sil could have defeated the strong Predators of the planet. He also returned your previous King's trident, which you used to defeat Yanny, but he could have used that himself as well.

"Their strength is beyond what they have revealed, and I think your God's reaction proved that."

It was true, and thinking more about it, Wince came to believe the same. In fact, if Quinn wasn't afraid of water or Wince didn't insist on going to the vault, they could have solved the matter far earlier. However, whatever the reasons, this had allowed them and their planet to grow, as well as herself. With the power given to her by Quinn, she could now face the outside threats that Yanny was so scared off.

"That doesn't change the fact that both of you chose to help when you didn't need to. I was merely a passenger on the Marpo Cruise. You did say it was for revenge, but the reason doesn't matter. You, and anyone from your Cruise, are free to stay here whenever they wish." Wince declared.

It was a nice offer, and Doguth didn't say anything else. And soon, he and Nog prepared to leave via spaceship to head back.

Once the ship left the planet and they entered space, looking at the water-covered planet, Doguth was thinking about something.

'It would be better if the others never found out about this place.'

The two soon got in contact with the Marpo cruise. They assumed that the repairs would be completed by now. As for what they would need to do, it was hard to say. If they could, they would love to just go back on the ship and do what they had been doing before: Travelling the Universe while stopping on board fights every now and again.

That's when they received quite a shocking message.

"Headquarters wants you both back here as soon as possible." The voice on the other end said, "Several reports have come in from the other passengers and staff, but they want to speak to you two directly since it has been said that you left with some passengers."

Nog wanted to complain back, wondering why they cared so much. It wasn't like they had left with the attackers of the ship, but Doguth gave the reply in the end.

"We will be there as soon as possible."

It took quite a while for them to travel through the vast Universe and, after about a week, to finally find a nearby-by cruise ship. They soon entered it and teleported themselves to the Marpo Headquarters.

The Marpo Headquarters was located on a deserted planet. There were no signs of life here, not even beasts, but the planet was gigantic, around the same size as Jupiter in the Solar System. Because of that, it was rich in minerals that could be used to build things reactively easily, like the giant cruise ships that flew from planet to planet.

Those in its galaxy abandoned the planet due to the lack of life. And also because there was the reason why there was no such life in the first place. There was no water, and no plants on this planet, meaning they would have to terraform the whole place to colonise this planet, and that was a long and arduous task.

Yet, somehow, the owner of the Marpo Cruise came out of nowhere and could do such a thing. Although it was a hard task to change the planet, it wasn't impossible if using resources from the nearby races and other planets.

This was why it had come as such a shock to other civilisations because one had succeeded in doing such a thing. It was as if someone had breathed life into the planet within one night, and now it was home to one of the most well-known companies in the Universe.

Exiting the teleporter, Doguth and Nog found themselves in a station. It was not accessed to the public, but instead one that the engineers would use.

It was a gigantic space, and the two couldn't even see the other end of this area. Around them, the mechanic staff were working on one of the large cruise ships. Some of them also looked like Nog, and many who didn't. However, they all had one thing in common: a humanoid figure.

"Why couldn't they just set up the teleporter to take us to the main base?" Nog asked, already getting tired of all the walking they would have to do to reach their destination.

"Because it's a risk, and you know it. The enemies can kill the Board members immediately if they get in there." Doguth replied as the two continued walking, looking for an exit.

They continued to watch the surroundings and soon saw a large metal panel around 30 metres wide carried by a single person. However, a person wasn't the right word because this figure was just as large as Doguth and had a tail like him because he was also a Dalki.

As they walked past, three spikes could be seen protruding out of the Dalki's back. That wasn't the only Dalki either. Moving around were a few more, spread far and in between, doing manual labour and building large spaceships that would be used for the Cruise line.

It wasn't a new site for the two of them, so they weren't too bothered by it. After finding an exit, the pair went into a tunnel that pulled them through a see-through shuttle. It took them outside, where they could see the planet's surface. The entire place was now practically a jungle, a vast difference from how the planet originally was.

All of the habitable areas were large enclosed facilities, just like the one they had come out from. This was to not disrupt the ongoing projects that were still going on throughout the planet, although the two didn't really know more details regarding this matter.

Eventually, the shuttle took a sharp turn, and they were now heading to a building encased in a complete black hard material. The headquarters where the Board Members lived. The very top of the building was in the shape of a semicircle sticking out with a large glass that allowed one to overlook all of the giant buildings in place, and that was exactly where the two of them were heading.

Nog was extremely nervous, as for Doguth, not so much since he had been here before. Inside the headquarters, all Nog could see were other Dalki, and with an elevator taking the two to the top floor, they were allowed to enter the large room.

Upon stepping out, they noticed several things in the hall, but a large desk and a chair facing away from them at the very end, next to a window. They noticed a pair of legs touching the floor and deduced someone was sitting on it.

At the same time, standing by the desk were two huge Dalki.

"I called you after we received an interesting report, but it seems the two of you were away during that time. Did you have fun?" The male voice came from behind the chair.

"I forwarded the report, sir. You have always allowed Captains to have a level of free will, and since these people were brave enough to attack the cruise ship, I thought I should teach them a lesson." Doguth answered.

"Very good." The man replied although it was hard to judge his thoughts based on his voice. "I hope this means the planet is destroyed and we should never have the same problem again. However, there was something else I heard as well, and I wish to confirm with you whether it was true or not. Is it true that there were two humans onboard the ship?

"As you know, I have a great interest in it myself, so if there is anything at all that you could tell me about them, that would be certainly helpful, and please do remember that I can tell if you choose to lie."

One of the Dalki began to walk forward, and a slight change in his eyes was seen. Seeing this, Doguth said everything about the humans that they had seen.

"I see." The man paused. "And the name of this black-haired person, do you remember it?"

"I believe…he was called Quinn," Doguth replied.

"Hm? Quinn… that's a name I haven't heard in a long time. But isn't he dead?"

*****

# Chapter 1868 Battle on Rein

Out in the middle of the vast ocean on Earth, a gigantic beam of white light suddenly hit the sea. It had caused gigantic waves to be pushed for hundreds and hundreds of miles. From a distance, it looked like someone had chucked a giant rock into a pound and ripples were being pushed out of it.

Eventually though, the giant white light started to fade. The power that it was emitting started to go away, and now falling through the sky, Quinn can see the sea in front of them.

Quinn was moving his hands about rapidly as he could see the dark blue sea coming closer and closer to him.

"That damned god didn't even give me time to prepare myself. If I meet him again, I'm going to drown him in this water!" Quinn shouted.

"Drown him?" Sil replied, casually just falling through the air. "I don't think that would be possible with a god that is based on a fish. Wait, can fish drown? I'm sure they can't?"

While in the middle of his thoughts, Sil summoned his soul weapon and had selected a few abilities that would help him in the situation. He came to a halt midway in the air and quickly flew over and caught Ceril.

"Thanks." Ceril replied. "But I would have been fine going into the water. Our bodies automatically transform when they become wet."

"Oh, so does that mean you want me to drop you then?" Sil asked.

Quickly, Ceril shook her head. Looking around and just from the smell of the water alone, she could tell this wasn't her planet. She was in a completely different place than before. Going into the sea, it felt a bit invasive for her.

Panicking, Quinn had continued to fall. He then saw that Sil was flying, to which he decided to activate his demon tier equipment. He was able to save himself a few inches away from the sea.

'Damn, I think I just embarrassed myself a little. If I had just thought about it, I could have activated the wings in the first place. Some day, I'm going to have to get over my fear of the water.'

There looked to be no land nearby. And because of that, Sil slowly descended and created a little ice platform for them to stand on. It was a square sharp about the side of an average house. Looking around, none of them knew where they were. It was hard to tell just by seeing the sea.

However, there was something else Quinn could use and had been meaning to use it for the longest time. Closing his eyes, he went to sense their energy. Before Quinn could only sense their energy if they were close by. At times, there were certain things that could get in the way of him finding the others.

Regardless of all these things, now Quinn could also rely on the dedicated follower celestial energy. He was searching out for his own energy amongst the planet and he had found it.

"There! This way!" Quinn said as he flew up and started moving. Sil quickly did the same as the three of them headed in an unknown location.

"What did you find!" Sil shouted.

"Peter…he's not too far away," Quinn replied back.

——

After the bright white light had disappeared, everyone was slowly getting back up on their feet. Some were quicker than others and Chris decided to take advantage of the situation. For the men that just came into the lab, Chris had a little trick.

He stomped his foot on the ground and trails of energy spreaded out from his foot, covering the entire floor. As they got up from the floor, a strange power was felt from underneath, entering their bodies.

Blood started pouring from their mouth, ears, and eyes. Nearly all of them had collapsed at that moment. Not only had they collapsed but around fifty or so of them were dead.

"What…was that, was that some type of Qi?" Lucia asked.

"Are you talking about the strange beam of light outside or what Chris just did?" Jessica replied back.

Honestly, Lucia wanted to know about both. She had trained her Qi up like many in the Graylash faction. Since nearly everyone used Qi, it had become the norm to add it to your abilities to power them more.

This though, it was on another level than what the others had seen. If she was to take a guess it looked like the third stage of Qi, but spread out far and wide across the ground. Something similar to Qi control, giving out a set of instructions to the Qi.F

"We did a good job destroying the lab, but there are still many places we have to get rid of. Let's head to the military base next!" Chris ordered. "There is a research lab there that focuses on the development of new weapons."

The group nodded and followed Chris closely behind. But as soon as they went through one set of steel doors to head back to the elevators, they realised that there was a problem straight in front of them.

"They..look so scary!" Minny pointed.

All of the twenty or so large cages that were filled with experimental humanoid beasts had broken. Most of them looked like dazed zombies, but as soon as they saw the group enter, many of them turned their heads.

"These guys are giving me the chills," Mitchell stated, as he began to activate his demon tier boots that he had received from fighting against the Chained. They started to glow blue and he was ready to leave at any second.

The group of humans closest had started to change. Their arms grew incredibly large, nearly twice the length and thickness of their own bodies, to the point where their bodies were lifted into the air while their giant arms were pressed against the ground.

At the same time, another group had transformed into a type of winged creature. A hideous face with multiple eyes and four sets of wings. One screamed towards them, firing off a sonic bomb straight at them, but Chris stood in the way.

The explosion hit his body, but there looked to be no harm done on his body at all. With a swipe of his arm, five marks went through the air and sliced them into multiple pieces that fell to the ground.

The strange giant armed creatures started to move, jumping with the power of their arms and raising them in the air ready to crush their enemies. A blood rifle was fired out hitting one of the creatures and causing half of its body to go missing.

Peter had leapt up in the air, punching one of the creatures, causing it to be sent back through the ship and creating a large hole. The others had joined in with lighting strikes and blood aura attacks to try and keep all of the creatures at bay.

"Don't attack too hard!" Chris shouted, as Peter. "If I really wanted to, I could destroy this whole ship. However, remember there are people on board that aren't involved in this. They are simply living here."

Peter had already made a couple of large holes in the ship from fighting. Holding back wasn't exactly his forte, but he would try his best while helping others. As he landed on his feet, a strange horse-like creature had crashed into him dragging him across the floor.

'All of the beast humans have different levels of strength. I see Pure would have been really difficult for others to deal with, but I'm not like others.' Peter cursed the antlers of the beast coming towards him and punched it on its head just hard enough to kill it on the spot.

Right now, he was wishing he had Laxmus's body by his side, but he hadn't been brought because he was afraid it would attract a bit too much attention in a place like this.

There were around two hundred beasts or so on board with different strengths and weaknesses. The group were finding it difficult to deal with them all, apart from Chris, who continued to kill everything with a swipe of his hand, slashing them into several pieces.

After a while, they had halved their numbers, but they had spent too long in the lab, as reinforcements had arrived. Pure members, holding onto their special Qi guns, were there.

Then rolling through, there was something else, a large Qi weapon, that had to be carried by two people. It was so heavy.

"Qi canon, watch out!" Chris shouted, as the end of the canon started to light up.

# Chapter ﻿1869 Re: Return of a legend (Part 1)

Several different departments were working through the Pure's ship, Rein, all for the sake of defeating the enemy that might come in the future.

These departments were hidden from the eyes of the public, giving the inhabitants a false picture of peaceful utopia, and even in cases of a scuffle with other factions, Pure would always try its best to show that they weren't the ones that would attack first.

They still displayed some things like a strong military and the Qi guns, but not all things were on display, such as the Humanoid beasts.

What they were witnessing right now in front of them was another device that was purely made for combat and to fight off, mainly the vampire corps, that didn't have much of an answer for Qi attacks.

"Let me deal with this!" Chris said as he stood forward. His arms grew slightly larger, and grey fur started to appear on the top of them both. His hands began to elongate, and his fingers turned into claws, while his eyes began to turn a slight yellow.

The large blast came straight out of the canon and destroyed anything it touched, including the humanoid beasts that were in its path. It almost looked like it disintegrated their bodies.

Gathering his own energy, Chris placed out his hands and began to absorb the energy in. The skin on his hands began to peel off but instantly regenerated after the attack hit him. This was all despite the Qi he was using to push the attack back.

"I wasn't expecting this," Lucia commented. "From what I have seen, Chris has an enormous amount of Qi, so why would he be affected so much by a Qi canon?"

"If you guys were hit by this, it would really hurt, maybe the Wight could get away unscathed, but I'm not too sure," Chris replied and continued to grunt while fighting off the energy.

At the same time, there were a few others who also joined the fray and began fighting against the beasts that were coming toward them.

"If the Qi enters your body, then it will make it hard for you to heal unless you have good control. Even then, this Qi is different because the Qi from the canon..."

At that moment, the attacks from the cannon had stopped, and a thud was heard as the large device was dropped to the ground, but they could see that the two who had used the cannon had also fallen to the ground.

"The energy the canon uses is life force Qi," Chris gritted his teeth in anger.

These people were willingly giving up their lives for Pure, all because they believed that they were accomplishing a goal, a lie they had been sold from their leader Zero, and none of it was true.

The Qi canon could draw out the life energy Qi, and it would usually come out when one was on its last legs when they had used up all their own Qi and were desperate.

There were, however, a few instances where one could control this life Qi at other times, and that was using the Qi drain skill and using the Qi transfer skill. However, no one had figured out the way to use them in battle until unique weapons such as these cannons were created and could do that very thing.

Chris didn't really know how they worked due to Agent Four being behind all of the workings of the weapons and devices that they had created. He was a true genius, which was even more worrying for Chris when he thought about where Agent Four could have taken the red heart and just what Zero was planning on doing with it.

The group were already dealing with the crazy humanoid beasts, and for some reason, they were only attacking them rather than those from Pure. Their troubles weren't over yet, though, because as soon as the Qi canon dropped to the floor, everyone else opened fire from their Qi guns.

The guns worked similar to the canon, only it was standard Qi rather than life force Qi, which was the most devastating type of Qi to be used in an attack.

Chris didn't wish to give them a chance to get the cannon up again, so he leapt over to the other side as fast as he could and lifted the Qi canon above his head. He then pulled it down and bashed it into his knee, breaking it in half.

The Qi bullets continued to hit Chris's body, but they appeared to do nothing to him as he looked at them all.

"Chris, stand down, why are you attacking us!" One of the men shouted while pointing the gun at him.

For a second, as he heard this, Chris was hesitant to attack them. These were his people. He had trained with them side by side, he knew their lives, and he knew they had families as well. Clenching his fist, it was then that he made a choice.

"There are two more areas you need to destroy!" Chris shouted. "In the military training room, there is a base, underground, that works on these weapons. Then, if you go to the top of the deck, there is an under compartment; there, they have a cell where they keep all the slaves. They are fed and trained only so Zero can take their Qi."

Muka and the others were wondering why Chris was telling them this. There had to be a reason, it sounded almost as if he wasn't going to come with them.

"I'm asking you all for another favour as well. If you can help it, don't kill these people, let me deal with them." It was then that Chris placed his hand on one of their heads, and their eyes went white just like they did before, only this time, they had passed out. There was no blood.

Doing this required more direct control over Qi, unlike the attack he did before, so he would have to go up to them one by one and put his palm over their heads.

"It looks like he is planning to knock them all out one by one. That is a tall task if he's planning to do that to everyone on the ship." Muka commented. "I guess he is going to be the distraction while we deal with the main task."

"Then let's deal with all of these things first!" Lucia shouted as she thrust her spear, and a bolt of red lighting came out, hitting one of the flying creatures above and sending it to the ground.

There were still a lot of Humanoid beasts, and they weren't the easiest things to take on. However, there was one that was going through them reactively easy.

Peter grabbed one of the beasts and pulled its head, slamming it against the floor.

The next moment he dragged it across, causing its head to rip off, and then threw the remains of its body towards another beast, knocking it out. Not resting or wasting any time, Peter was already onto the next beast.

"Arghh! This is frustrating!" Peter shouted. "There's too many of them, screw this!"

He activated his celestial energy, but instead of transforming his arms, he brought out his head tail. The current situation reminded him very much of fighting against the Horde of beasts that had attacked the Vampire Corps, only this time, he knew how to use his new weapon better.

With two hands and a sharp head tail, he easily sliced and cut a number of beasts until eventually there were no longer any more for them to deal with.

"Alright, we're done here," Peter said. "Now, let's destroy those places Chris asked us to and get out of here."

Meanwhile, it looked like Chris was done as well. He had caused the enemies at the scene to collapse, but he didn't plan to travel with the others because he knew there would be more coming as they manoeuvred around the ship.

"Let-" Before Peter could finish his sentence, everyone suddenly heard a loud crash on board the ship. In the next moment, several crashes resounded as if something was breaking through the floors above them, and as they readied themselves to fight another enemy, the ceiling cracked, and three people suddenly came out and landed in front of them.

One had large wings sticking out for his demon tier chest piece, while another had a soft touch as he put down a blue-haired female to her side.

"Am I…dreaming things…is that…Quinn!" Jessica almost shouted.

Not greeting the others, though, Quinn turned around and could see Chris partially transformed on the other side.

"It's time for round 2," Quinn smiled.
