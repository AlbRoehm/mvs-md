# Chapter 1440 - The Power Of A War God
At the moment, Vincent was feeling pretty relaxed about the situation he was in. Although he didn't have Quinn's shadow powers outside, since they would be fighting in a game, 'his' avatar would have them.

Of course, Logan was unable to input the exact amount of MC cells that Quinn could control. During the test his MC cells seemed endless and since this was just a game and Quinn had already displayed his powers he asked Logan to just put a high amount. Win or lose it didn't matter to Quinn since the results didn't matter. All that mattered was the outcome in real life.

Another thing was replicating all of what the shadow could do, it was a hard task with limited time, so Vincent would only have access to the basics. However, in the tenth leader's mind that should be more than enough.

He had practised using the Shadow before, back when Quinn had used the Demon tier Amulet leaving him in control of his body. If there was anyone who could play the part of his descendant, it would be him.

"I've lived a long life." Sera suddenly said from the other side, as a sword seemingly appeared out of nowhere and entered his hands. The sword looked to be rather ordinary, lacking any features distinguishing it from other beast weapons. Even as he swung the sword a few times, nothing looked to be special about it.

The sudden statement had distracted Vincent a little, he had intended to go in and try to overwhelm him with this body's strength alone, yet there were two reasons why he had yet to do anything.

For one, he didn't exactly gain anything by finishing the fight fast. They had no idea what else the Board had planned for them, so if he could buy Quinn some time to finish investigating whatever he was busy doing, it would be beneficial to them.

As for the second reason, his opponent was the one with a God residing inside him. Not knowing what ability the person had, Vincent had cast the Shadow ability, so it was active constantly on his back.

'The question is… is he a dormant God that has no idea about who he is… or is he like Bliss? If it's the latter, then this fight might be a little more difficult than I had envisioned.'

"There are a lot of things that are similar between me and you." Sera continued to speak. "For one, I crave the sight of blood, and as time has gone on, I have found the best way to enhance these powers of mine to fit with the current time… all so I can see more blood."

A smile appeared on Sera's face, which sent large shivers down Vincent's spine. Him a vampire leader that knew no fear, and in a game of all things.

It was then that Sera activated his ability on the sword in his hand, making the weapon glow slightly blue. The distance between the two fighters had been great. However, when Sera made a simple swing this time, a sharp slash had left his weapon.

It looked somewhat similar to a Qi strike, yet it was clearly different; it was larger than any Qi strike seen before, and the top of the attack nearly reached the clouds above. Vincent knew that he couldn't allow that attack to hit him. He might be resilient, but he had to move away.

There was no need for him to activate the Blue Fang set, but had a feeling that if he tried to block that attack with the Shadow, the game might be unable to register that he had enough MC points.

Running to the side, Vincent avoided the large slash.

The strike continued forward and eventually ended, yet it had left behind a giant fissure. It was hard to tell how deep it went, as one wouldn't be able to see the bottom of it.

"What was that?!" Hermes had his mouth left wide open.

Seeing the reaction of the others in the room, Abdal couldn't help but laugh.

"I told you he would surprise you all, that man is the most dangerous man I have ever met… A master of weapons, capable of finding any opponent's weakness, a brilliant genius of war and tactics and lastly his ability… it allows him to make any weapons in his hand at the Demon tier level!"

Those in the room were unsure if Abdal's words were true or not, but after witnessing what they had done, they felt inclined to believe him. After all, how could such a basic looking sword produce so much damage.

They had heard of abilities making weapons stronger, by one or two ranks, but usually that was limited, and the higher rank the weapon was the more MC cells it required. The sword in Sera's hand looked around the advanced tier level.

"It annoys me." Owen finally spoke. "That people like this, have chosen to hide their face for whatever reason, while the war is going on."

"Oh, there's a simple reason for that." Abdal said. "How would you learn of him if there was no one left alive to talk about it?"

Looking closely, if what was said was true, Owen was worried about Quinn. Around his waist, there were several storage devices, which possibly meant that Sera was carrying multiple weapons along with him. The God of War seemed ready to use them as he wished, and he was right.

Next appearing in Serah's hands was a large bow, and immediately, multiple arrows were placed in the string. Before pulling, each one of them lit up with flames, heading straight for Vincent.

Sera didn't stop there though, loading up the bow again, and shooting out another set of arrows just after it. Doing this three times, the arrows practically covered everywhere that the map had to display, and there was nowhere for Vincent to avoid the attack.

That was, unless he had the Shadow ability. Using Shadow travel, Vincent was able to make himself practically part of the ground and move forward.

"An interesting ability." Sera started to run forward, and he was just as fast if not faster than the vampire leaders. At the moment, his body was clad in gladiator type armour from head to toe. If his ability was true, then it wasn't just limited to weapons but would also work with armour as well.

Everything he had on him was giving him a boost. On a closer look, the spectators could see rings on his ears, and even a small band that would shine once in a while when his black hair was blown a little by the wind.

Next he jumped in the air, and could see the shadow below.

"Seeing that shadow again, makes me feel sick!" Sera shouted.

One of his dimensional storage boxes around his waist activated, giving him what looked like a giant sledgehammer. Holding onto it tightly, he swung the weapon down towards the ground.

"Let's see you hiding below me, after I'll destroy the entire area!"

The watching vampire leaders felt like this could spell trouble, and were wondering how such a human had gone unknown for so long.

———

Quinn paused for a second, he had a strange feeling in his body and he was unsure what it was. For a moment he turned around to where the fighting arena should be.

'So you felt that as well, huh?' Ray asked. 'I thought it was only me… but this feeling reminds me of someone… someone very annoying to deal with.'

'You don't speak much about your past.' Quinn said. 'I guess you must have known a lot of the Gods back then.'

'Not really.' Ray replied. 'It's none of my business and the past is in the past. Besides, now isn't the best time for a history lesson, don't you think? You have your own troubles that you need to face, and from what I can tell they're just as big as mine during my time.'

Ray was right, because they had finally reached the facility on the south side. The entrance looked identical to that of the one on the north, just as Nathan had said. At least he hadn't been lying about that.

"He's waiting for me there?" Quinn asked.

"I'm not sure if he's there himself, since he just told me to bring you here. However, the fact that he wants to meet with you tells me one thing… I think he wants to talk to you, Quinn." Nathan answered.

From this point on, Quinn decided to take the lead, and walk in front of Nathan, yet he did so with a set of eyes on his back. His Shadow was activated and Quinn was ready for anything.

'Let's see what you want to talk about, Zero!'

# Chapter 1441 - Stronger Outside
Demon tier gear was the hardest equipment to come by. Since the dawn of the human age, only a few such pieces have been available. So learning that there was someone who could make any beast gear up to the demon tier level, everyone already knew how amazing this ability was.

Adding this with the fact that this person could also master any weapon at will, indicated that this person would certainly be strong.

Sera slammed the sledgehammer down into the ground. It sent out a visible circle shockwave like a ripple in the ground when it touched the floor, and it looked like the surface itself was burning somewhat as it spread out.

Vincent could see the ripple of energy coming towards him. He was still in his shadow travel. It was a skill meant only to be used for movement, but he had never been hit while in this form before, and he wasn't sure Quinn had either.

Because of this, he wasn't quite sure what would happen if he was hit in this form, and a few seconds later, he found out. Since it was a game, it would be whatever Logan had programmed it to do. The ripple touched the shadow, and the skill had been deactivated, practically throwing Vincent out of skill and onto the area floor.

He immediately felt a searing pain as the ripple touched him and had no choice but to use blood Hardening on his forearms. The ripple was pushing him back, and Vincent gave his all to hold his ground, but suddenly, he saw a swing of the sword coming his way.

Of course, Sera wasn't being held up by the attack, so he would be able to fight just fine. The shadow had moved to his position, blocking the initial sledgehammer ripple attack, leaving Vincent to deal with the dual swords he could see in front of him.

Like all the other equipment that Sera used, there was a slight glow on it. It was hard to tell if it was from his ability or the active skills of the weapon, but it didn't matter.

'I need to get my head back in the game and focus on taking him out. Otherwise, I'm going to lose before showing everything I've got. Right now…I am playing the part of the Vampire King, and I can not lose!' Vincent regained his composure.

The main problem with the shadow was its slow movement speed, and with Sera's speed being as fast as a Vampire Leader, perhaps faster, only a little slower than Quinn's, it looked like Vincent would have to fight in the old fashioned way.

'I wasn't that good at using the shadow in the first place.' Vincent pursed his lips.

He threw a fist right between the two swords at the right time. His martial arts skills weren't lacking. However, it looked like Sera had somewhat predicted this; his swords didn't come to strike Vincent; instead, they crossed each other and came down in some X shape.

They hit the gauntlet and managed to stop Vincent's blow from hitting Sera's face.

"I see you've never fought someone who could keep up with you before," Sera said.

What was more worrying was the effect of these weapons. Unlike the last ones, there didn't seem to be some strong, powerful energy coming from them. The next second and the gauntlet on Vincent's hand started to grumble right in front of him.

It was his energy-draining gauntlet. Seeing this, Vincent was just thankful that he was facing this person in the game. Otherwise, he wouldn't have had a clue how to tell Quinn of such bad news.

Since the gauntlet was crumbling in front of his eyes, Vincent hardened the rest of his arm using Blood Hardening.

"I can see you've never fought against a Vampire before either!" Clenching his fist, Vincent activated the blood spray, shooting out the energy of red aura directly on Sera's face.

It seemed to have taken him by surprise as he closed his eyes, and the hit flung his head back slightly.

'I can feel that they have made Quinn's blood aura strong, but I'm afraid if this person allowed someone like Quinn to do this, who is stronger than I am and has the power of Qi… you would have died right there and then.' Vincent thought.

He admitted that Sera was strong; it was just that Quinn had too many powers that one needed to counter.

As he went in for another strike, Vincent's fist hit a large rectangular shield. Others heard a clang but nothing else; it seemed the shield had taken the blow well.

With his current strength, most shields wouldn't have been able to withstand a blow such as that. The next second, though, and the shield started to spin. The force was strong, and he could feel someone pushing him back.

The audience saw what had happened; there was no one on the other side pushing the shield at all. It was another active skill being used. Once again, Sera had changed his weapon to a spear.

After some struggle, Vincent had managed to move away from the shield, only to find a spear coming towards him. He thought he could block it until it had extended suddenly. It increased its speed and length, hitting him right underneath the ribs and going through him in seconds.

It was a fatal wound, but the game didn't end yet. Vampires were resilient, after all.

"Do you think your favourite person is going to lose?" Grim asked.

"Perhaps in the game, but I still think he would win in a real battle. We have seen Quinn do many things that he hasn't done in this match, and he has hardly used the shadow as well."

Abdul could hear everything going on, and he was thinking the same thing about Sera. As one of the few people allowed to travel with Sera, he had seen some crazy things that Sera hadn't performed because the game simply wouldn't allow him to, and his real powers were actually more useful on others.

"Still, this opponent is tricky. Usually, when two opponents are of equal strength, it takes some time to learn the others' powers and attack patterns. Here, the pattern, rhythm, skills, they are all rapidly changing and evolving, making the fight unpredictable."

The spear was inside Vicnet's side, and he could tell that Sera was trying to spin it to cause more damage, but Vincent currently had it held in his hands, refusing to let him do so. Causing the two of them to just stand there opposite each other.

'This really is an embarrassment.' Vincent said. 'I guess I have to resort to that.'

[Nitro accelerate activated]

Bearing through the pain, Vincent moved backwards out from the spear willingly, and the next second, he was directly in Sera's face with a blood drill. His speed had drastically increased thanks to the armour set.

Sera had somehow formed another shield, nearly identical to the last one, blocking Vincent's attack again, but before Sera could perform another similar trick, Vincent appeared behind him.

His other hand was similarly covered in the blood drill and slammed right into Sera's back. It was a strong attack, and with speed, it usually would have pierced right through any armour; however, like every other set-piece he owned, this one was strong.

A pair of daggers appeared in Sera's hands, and Vincent wasn't sure if he was imagining it or not, but they seemed to give him extra speed as well.

'You've gotten faster, so you've made this a battle of speed. Well, I can do that as well!' Sera said as he went to attack.

The two were fighting close, one using just his bare fist and blood to attack in short-range and bursts, while the other using daggers to cause small cuts here and there but still unable to land a fatal blow.

The audience couldn't keep their eyes off the match, and even blinking, it felt like they had missed five movements happen at once. After crossing several hits from both sides, they were exhausted, and Vincent knew his time was running out but was unsure if it was the same for the other one.

In the end, Vincent had to risk it all. He gathered a blood canon in his hand. Preparing the strike, he charged in. He dodged all the swings from the blades as much as he could, and when he was sure he would make the hit, Vincent opened his palm and placed it right up against Sera's stomach.

At the same time, Sera had swung his blade towards Vincent's neck, but it didn't seem that it would hit until it changed into the small sword that he had used at the very beginning.

"It's over!" They both shouted. Vincent's blood cannon had gone off, and the strange large energy attack had also left from Sera's sword.

The match was over…and for the first time since the event, there was no winner.

The match was a draw.

The audience was stunned into silence. One second they were non-stop fighting equally, and in the next second, the match had ended. When the two left their pods, they both were in strange moods.

"I…I want to fight that guy…in real life!" Sera shouted after leaving the pod.

The others didn't know what to say and just left him be as he went to the corner of the container and looked out to the other side where the vampires were.

'Phew…I managed to make that at least a draw…so Quinn can't be too upset with me, right?' Vincent thought, thankful that the match had at least ended without a big upset.

The vampire leaders didn't want to say anything because none of them were sure they could have done a better job, and there were still the other matches to go ahead.

"That…unranked is dangerous," Andy said. "We need to think about him as well. Also, it looks like we have had the go ahead, and it looks like Pure is making their move."

The Board members nodded at his words, and the machine started to rotate through those who would be fighting next, and the first time in the event, one of the Pure members had been elected to participate in a fight. It was Agent Three.

And he was going to face Jin, who was now selected for the second time.

Chris, seeing this, looked towards the empty south container.

'It's beginning.'

# Chapter 1442 - The Man Behind Pure
Nervousness, anger, worry, and a mix of other emotions were going through Quinn's head right now as he walked through the facility. Just like the one on the north side, there were countless experimental rooms that had been set up, though none of them seemed to have any active experiments being performed.

"These rooms were built here before Pure had taken control of everything, right? Doesn't that mean that this was either the Board's doing or the Supreme Commander's? Just what were they doing here?" Quinn asked.

Now that he had someone on the inside, he was hoping to get some answers. For some reason, though, it seemed like Nathan was having difficulty answering that question.

"Yes and no." Nathan replied. "You're right about it being set up before Pure had 'taken over' as you so put it, but it's really not like that. Most of the experiments that happened here had to do with enhancing the human body.

"During and after the first Dalki war, the military became obsessed with creating some type of super soldier. After all, our bodies had proven useless against them and our bodies were clearly weaker than the Dalki. Initially, those with strong abilities had only been those like the 'Originals'. Those were desperate times… I'm sure you understand, Quinn."

Hearing Nathan talk about that, sounded like a repeat of what Paul had told him at the time. However, while the military might have felt that the results justified the means, Quinn didn't like it one bit. After all, the people that had been selected as nothing but glorified guinea pigs had been those like the old him or Peter.

Just like when certain people had been handed over to Truedream in the past, always the ones that weren't the most useful would be thrown into these situations to try to at least make them useful. Those in control saw no problem with that… but Quinn did. Still, he bit his tongue about this situation, as this was something that had already happened.

"What do you mean by 'no', then?" Quinn asked as the two of them reached the gigantic, thick Glathrium doors.

"You will find out once you go through there… I've been told not to come with you." Nathan answered, seemingly evading the question, though.

Having to go in by himself wasn't an issue for the Vampire Lord. Honestly, Quinn thought it was for the best, as he had his own Shadow ability. He could always use it to get out by himself, so bringing someone else along just meant there was more chance of something happening to them.

Knowing full well that this was a trap, Quinn headed in anyway, not fearing what was to come. Using Shadow travel, he found himself inside the same dark strange area that was surrounded by Glathrium all around.

The slight smell of blood hit his nose. It wasn't too strong but unlike the last area he had entered, this one didn't seem to be filled with bodies. Looking up, he could see the glass observation room that stretched around the place, and on one panel was a whole screen instead, that turned on.

"I'm glad you could make it, Quinn Talen. When I first heard your name, I couldn't believe it. To think I would live to see the day when a child like you could hold so much power that I would need to resort to all of this." The voice spoke, revealing the appearance of Zero.

'So this is what Nathan meant when he said everything would make sense…' Quinn thought as he looked at the man. The one Quinn was currently staring at, Zero… was a member of the board. He was the old man who stood on stage and the one who had done the most talking. However, there were still countless questions on his mind that didn't quite make sense.

'Who would have thought that a member of the Board could be the leader of Pure at the same time. This would certainly allow him to have Pure agents in the military whenever he wished. With the other factions sharing information, no wonder they knew what everyone was doing…

'The experiments that Pure ran, the experiments that the military ran, they weren't researching separate things. It was all the same, orchestrated by this person.'

"Why?" Quinn asked. "What you're doing doesn't make any sense! I know who you really are. You're Leo's master, correct? How can you be doing all of this?! Why didn't you become someone great like Leo, and how come he didn't recognise you?!"

This was what Quinn was slightly confused about. Surely Leo should have recognised his master's aura or frame, and on the stage he should have sensed that he had Qi.

"Ah, Leo, yes… my foolish disciple who has joined you. Oh well, I have long since decided to forgive him for what he has done, but that is also why I thought that I wouldn't bring him along on my journey." Zero answered cryptically. "As the one who knows him the best, how could I not know how to hide from? Coincidentally, he is the main reason I wished to see you.

"Why would someone who had been hailed a great hero from the war choose to follow a youngling like you out of everyone. I was intrigued to see the type of man he had chosen to follow."

" 'Forgive him'?" Quinn repeated back, pointing towards the screen. "Why would Leo ever need you to forgive him?! If he learns what you've done… everything you've orchestrated… the more I think about it, I doubt even Pure knows that you are a member of the Board…" It then hit Quinn… he had no idea what that man's end goal was.

Pure and the military service seemed like enemies, but if one man was behind both organisations, what goal did he pursue? As one of the mightiest men alive, why would he have needed to create an organisation like Pure in the first place?

"What are you planning to do? And don't you dare give me some crap about 'trying to make the world a better place without abilities', that Sham is over!" Quinn shouted.

There was silence between the two for a while, until eventually zero started to laugh slightly.

"You're not a big fan of Lucy's idealism, I see. It truly is a shame. That woman was so 'pure' and innocent in her belief. She truly wished to see her ambitions to create a world without leaders come to fruition. Her drive was what attracted people around her. When I heard about her plans and mission, I thought, surely there are more people like her that I can use in this type of situation.

"I won't deny it, Pure, the military, both of them are ultimately tools… yet, I fail to see what reason I have to share my plan with you. All you need to know is that everyone at this event will die today, allowing me to achieve what I need to achieve… and that includes you, Quinn."

After hearing this, there was a sinking feeling in Quinn's heart, he was worried about the others, and thought they needed help. Talking to Zero wasn't really going to get him anywhere. It didn't seem like he was in this room, he had to warn the others.

Quickly, Quinn tried to use his Shadow travel, but something was wrong. In trying to do so, his Shadow wasn't summoned at all. He quickly checked his system, and it seemed fine, but he noticed that he was unable to summon any of the leaders by his side, and it was safe to say all communication was cut off as well.

'What is all this? This didn't happen in the last room! What is going on, why can't I use my abilities?' Quinn thought.

Thankfully, it seemed like he was still able to use his blood powers, the Absolute Blood Control and also his Qi as well. It looked like he might have to really test himself to see if he could break out of such a room or not.

"Hahaha." Zero started to cackle. "Judging by the confused look on your face, you just tried and failed to escape. You see, beast crystals certainly are fascinating little things, and they have far more uses than acting as energy sources or raw materials to be crafted into weapons.

"When exploring planets and discovering new types of crystals, us members of the Board were the ones who received them. With how rare they were, we kept them to ourselves, Upgrade Crystals, Ability Enhancement Crystals, and many, many more." Zero explained.

Hearing this, Quinn could make some sense of what the Pure leader was saying. One time, Quinn had received an Upgrade Crystal as a quest reward. Although the system was a mysterious thing, he didn't think it would just create something that didn't exist, yet he had never found any news about such crystals existing.

If the Board had kept it a secret, hiding this information from the others, then they probably did the same with all the other crystals they had, and right now one of these special types of crystals was being used to stop Quinn from using his ability.

"It makes me smile when I think about how much those real Pure members would have done to get their hands on such a crystal." Zero happily said. "Quinn, we all saw how well you did fighting against those Dalki… you did a great job, but there was only ever one of you.

"Fortunately, our experiments finally brought forward a success. Let me see how well you do against our own superhumans." Zero finished with the TV screen turning off.

At that moment, the sound of several vents were heard producing steam, and several of the side doors were opening.

# Chapter 1443 - Agent Three Special?
It was the first time one of those from Pure was fighting, and it seemed like those on the Human side were more interested in seeing what they had to offer. After all, these were people who refused to wield abilities yet somehow still managed to gain a position here, in front of the world's strongest.

At some point, each of their factions had a run-in with agents of Pure. Simply because of their beliefs, a few extremists in the group would either attack any ability user on-site or simple arguments would occur.

However, they weren't the type of group that planned to outright attack the others. Pure had seemed to have waged war on only the military itself, leaving most of the big four alone until the Civil war.

The big scar on Agent Three's face was seen as he walked forward. Not once did he smile, speak or show any form of emotional expression at all as he got into the pod.

"Your teammate sure seems friendly," Mona said out loud, hoping Chris would hear; he was more approachable out of the two of them.

"He doesn't need to speak to show off his actions." Chris simply replied with a smile.

At that moment, Mona was sure she had noticed something and pulled on Samantha's sleeve. Bringing her over away from the others a little bit. Before saying anything, Mona pointed towards the south container with her chin.

"Have you noticed what that big guy has been up to?" She whispered.

Samantha looked in that direction, and at a brief glance, she couldn't see anything strange; she hadn't even paid much attention to Chirs before this moment, unlike Mona. The Supreme Commander, the head of the Earthborn group, and many strong people were in the room at the moment. The mere thought that Pure might try to do something here seemed strange to her.

It will only lead to a bad outcome, and the Board must have made sure that no other Pure members would be there.

'They can't be planning to do something here, are they? I'm sure the Board has some plan to get rid of the vampires, maybe frame them for something…but they wouldn't do anything to us.'

This was what Samantha was thinking. Getting rid of all of them would practically doom the human race, and it would be impossible not to notice.

"Maybe I'm just overthinking things, but that guy has looked far too much over at the south container. It's like he's expecting something to happen at any moment. I am just telling you so you can stay on guard."

Before Agent Three had entered into the VR machine, Leo was also paying close attention, for there was something quite strange with the former's Qi. His hand was hovering firmly over his hilt as he was ready for anything.

The field started to load, and it was the strangest map they had seen yet. Several large gigantic tunnels had appeared. These tunnels were connected in several different ways, and there was a small stream of dark water.

The machine had cut the top of the tunnels to let the audience observe everything and witness what exactly was happening.

"That's a…sewer system, right?" Fex said, asking the question that was on everyone's mind. On the vampires' side, Jin was fighting again, and just like other vampires, he had already fought once.

This map didn't seem quite favourable for him. For instance, using an explosion would most likely hurt him because of the closed walls. Or at least that's what the others thought until they saw Jin cutting his hand and throwing blood towards the wall on his side, destroying it in an instant and realigning another path of a tunnel.

'The game always starts with both of us on the other side. This sewer system is messing my nose…so let's deal with this quickly.'

Like before, everyone's eyes were focused on the fight in front of them, all except Mona, who was constantly staring at Chris to see if there were any strange movements. Right at that moment, Chris looked over at Mona and gave her a wink before giving her a wave.

"It's a trap!" She shouted.

The shout from Mona didn't quite register with everyone as quickly as it should have done, and the next second, green—coloured smoke started to enter the room immediately. It sounded like the door behind them was closed a few seconds later.

"Everyone, cover your mouth, use anything to avoid inhaling the smoke!" Sach shouted.

He had immediately noticed what this green smoke was - a sleeping gas. There was one user with the ability to create strong potent sleeping gas.

Far stronger than humans could make, the military used this special gas quite frequently. It was less effective against large beasts, so they rarely used it that way, but if they needed to contain a beast, they would instantly fill the room with this gas.

No matter how strong of an ability user one was, if they were to inhale this gas and fall asleep, they would be sitting ducks. Helpless to do anything.

'Hmm, I see what they did.' Logan thought, with his face covered - using the usual spiders to form a special mask from him. He looked around and saw that others in the room were falling fast while a few were somehow persisting.

'They knew that I would be here, so they decided to give everything a mechanical release rather than a digital one. They must-have set up quite the contraption to avoid Leo's ability as well, and it must have been someone who knew both mine and Leo's abilities well.' Thinking about all this, he found it hard to pinpoint who the culprit could be.

The Board knew a lot about Logan's ability, but the same couldn't be said about others. In contrast, only the Pure members knew about Leo's ability. Judging by the fact that Chris had left, though, Logan was putting his bets towards the latter.

'It looks like not everyone knew about this plan of theirs either.' Logan noticed that even the butlers in the room with them had succumbed to the smoke.

The vampires in the room seemed to have more strength than the others, and the smoke hadn't affected them that much, making Logan consider they might have a natural immunity to it.

However, he couldn't say the same for the others. Mona, who was still standing, had activated her beast gear and tried her best to gather her strength. Still, even without breathing, it felt like the smoke was affecting her somehow. Throwing out her fist as hard as she could, it had hit the glass wall. The impact shook the whole room, but there wasn't even a scratch on It.

"What is that glass made of? It's as hard as Glathrium!" Sach frowned.

At the same time, Grim and Owen were still standing. Lighting was striking their bodies, and it looked as if they were in pain. Perhaps a way to keep them awake. They tried to use their abilities on the glass container. Firing out a lighting strike, but it also did nothing.

"The boy…he can break us out!" One of the generals shouted; however, as soon as he reached Sil, he found out that the latter had long fallen asleep. The two women eventually fainted, but the large warrior grabbed Mona, placing her over one of his shoulders while supporting Samantha in the other hand, holding her by her waist.

It was strange to witness because he still held the giant box in his other hand, which was why he had to place one of them over his shoulder. Clearly, it would have been easy to place the box down.

Now, among the few still standing in the room were Sera and Abdul, but the latter looked to be barely hanging on. The same could be said for those two in the Graylash family, and seeing this, Logan had been able to use his powers to generate two more makeshift masks for both of them.

"Put them on! I could only make two, and I won't be able to make them quick enough for the others." Logan said, wishing that he had given one to Sil. Perhaps if it was him, with the powers of all the others, he could have broken out of the glass container.

Leo and Sach were also alright, but no one knew how long they could persist; on the other side, the smoke was making it hard for them to see.

"I'll just have to cut the glass!" Leo said as he drew his sword. At that moment, the sound of a mechanism was being opened, and it was from the VR pod. That was towards the end of the glass. Quickly standing in front of them, glowing eyes could be seen through the smoke.

It was Agent Three, but something was different about him.

# Chapter 1444 - A Common Link
Just like the human side, the vampires were also busy watching the spectacle down below. Nothing had happened so far between the fights, but unlike their counterparts, they had remained vigilant, constantly suspicious that something was bound to happen.

In the middle of the match, smoke started to enter the room, yet the vampire leaders didn't look panicked or scared. Instead, they just looked at each other, some of them shaking their heads.

"It never could have been dealt with peacefully, could it?" Jake sighed.

"Well, Quinn did mention to all of you that something was going on, and judging by the fact that he still hasn't returned yet, it can only mean whatever they're planning has started." Vincent pointed out as he went over to the glass and pressed his hand against it.

When entering the room, the first thing he noticed was that this was no ordinary glass. As someone who had happily researched new materials and matters during his time, he could tell from the beginning.

'Is it a mixture of beast crystal energy? In a way, what we are currently in now is more similar to a giant beast armour with an active skill. They must have done a lot of testing with crystals to get this far.' Vincent, for one, was amazed at what the humans had accomplished.

If only they had figured it out a few hundred years ago, like the vampires had done. As impressive as something like that was, it was mostly useless… except for a situation like this. Still it paled in comparison to the black substance that the vampires had manufactured that was able to be modelled far easier and its durability was only a little less of the glass. They did, however, still use the same material for their windows, when they wanted something see through and still strong.

Still, the fact that they had discovered this without the help of Richard Eno meant that the humans were naturally evolving and catching up. At this moment and time, he didn't know whether to be happy or sad.

"You think we can break it?" Sunny asked, noticing that Vincent was busy thinking, rather than helping out. "Although this gas might not be far less effective on us than the humans, we aren't like the undead. It will eventually put us to sleep if we don't get out of here soon enough."

"Of course we can break it." Vincent replied. "I was just observing the situation on the other side. For them, it might not be so easy for them to break it if the gas has affected them."

"Let's hurry up then! What if they can't get out on their own?!" Fex shouted. "We have to save them!"

"Why? Some humans are betraying other humans, the way I see it. If they want to fight and kill each other, then just let them be." Katori shrugged, the smoke was affecting her seemingly more than the older vampires. The fact that she was succumbing to it more than the others was making her furious, helping her stay conscious longer.

"Where have I heard something like that before? Oh, that's right, isn't that the SAME as what happened to us vampires?!" Fex argued, adamant that the right choice was to help them. "Remember, if it wasn't for Quinn and the others, you also would have just killed each other!

The sound of the VR pod could be heard opening and Jin exited from the game. Immediately he could see the smoke and could tell that something was going on.

"There are strong vampires on the other side." Muka said, trying to make the situation seem a bit more upbeat and calm a certain worry of her fellow Royal Knight. "Like us, they won't be affected by the gas too much. I'm sure they will be able to break out of the glass, besides, they also have two monsters on their side."

Vincent couldn't agree more, there was the Unranked named Sera who easily should have been able to break out of the glass using at least one of his weapons, and then there was Sil. After having fought him, Vincent couldn't imagine that one with the power of a God would fall to an ability like a sleeping gas.

Even if the two would be taken out of the equation there were still Leo and Sach.

'My worry is, why haven't they left yet?' It was then that Vincent readied his fist, and started to spin blood in his hand, performing the Blood drill. The others seeing this, followed the tenth leader's lead and readied their fists as well. All the leaders' powers weren't needed, it was just that they wanted to work off a little frustration.

All of them aimed their attack at the same place. As durable as the glass was, against the combined power of all those vampires it stood no chance, making the gas disperse into the arena. It looked like there wasn't a constant flowing amount, because as soon as the gas went into the open air, they could all see clearly again.

"The quickest way to the other side is through the arena." Vincent said, and the group began to make their move from the stands to the other side.

---

Inside the Boardroom, nine of the members were still seen inside. Unlike the others, their room was not being flooded with gas, though they seemed unsurprised by everything that was happening, including the vampire leaders managing to break out.

"It seems like it has all begun." Andy spoke. "At the end of today, there will probably be one clear winner… and as for me… I actually hope the humans win… and get rid of Pure."

The others turned to him, surprised by his words, but they all felt the same way. They wanted to get rid of the vampires, making their goals seemingly align with Pure somewhat, but being threatened like this, seeing humanities' hope disappearing like this was something they didn't wish to see.

"Unfortunately, you won't be there to see the result." An old man said. It was the old Board member who had returned from where he had come from. When seeing him, the others were calm as they usually were, for he was someone who had led them for over half a century, but what exactly did his words mean now?

"Each one of you did nothing when the Dalki came to attack the first time. You all scrambled your assets and did your best to hold onto what power you could retain… and then you took advantage of a situation. While I can't claim to be a saint, many people died because of your selfish needs that time, which is something I can't forgive."

The Board members were shocked to say the least after hearing Mr Watson's words.

"What nonsense are you spouting? Have you gone senile in your old age?! " Andy shouted back, not a hint of the earlier respect in his eyes. "Wasn't it you who was the first to do all of that?! You hoarded all the food supplies, and that's when we came together to make a deal! In a way, you're even worse than us, so why are you talking as if you had the moral high ground?"

"Indeed, Mr Watson was no better than any of you. However, he's already been dealt with a very long time ago. At the start of all this nonsense known as the board… and now it's time for all of you to join him. May you find peace, knowing that your sacrifice will help me achieve my goal." Zero said. With a wave of his hand, the command was given, and the Qi that had been deposited in their minds, proceeded to directly strike their brain.

All of them had fallen to the ground after a few seconds, their death seemingly painless… or too fast to allow them to even react.

'You should have read the invitation carefully. When it stated 'No one' was to know about this event, it meant no one.' Zero thought as he threw his walking stick onto the floor.

The next moment, he cracked his back and stood up right, before he proceeded to dig into his face, only to reveal a strange looking mask. Once it was ripped off, one would see the face of a young man, seemingly in his thirties. He had shaven stubble all around his face and healthy long black hair, but what was most noticeable and stood out about the person, was a strange marking on the top of their forehead.

It looked somewhat like a bat, as there was a large single eye, and two wings on his forehead.

# Chapter 1445 - End Your Pain
Moments before Quinn had entered the room, the second that Nathan saw him leave his sight, he had a sick feeling in his stomach. It might have been hard to see under his clothing, but his body had been heavily sweating throughout the whole confrontation the two of them had.

'I'm sorry Quinn… I really am…but if I don't do this, then my family is at risk as well.' Nathan thought as he pulled out a strange looking crystal and held it in his hand. This one was strangely round, which was an odd shape for one.

Usually, beast crystals had rough edges and looked somewhat similar to raw large diamonds. The clarity of each one would go up the higher its tier, only the crystal in Nathan's hand emitted the same type of energy as it would from a beast, yet at the same time it was clearly different.

'This crystal, it really will enhance my powers, and I can do this…right?' Nathan started to wonder. He held onto the crystal with one hand, as it slowly started to light up. Nathan had his other hand held out, and a large bubble started to form from it. Larger than he had ever produced before. It continued to grow and grow, and even went through the walls.

'The Enhancement crystal, it's working…but that is bad news for you, Quinn.'

Nathan's ability allowed him to create a zone. Inside these zones, one would be unable to use their ability. Of course, one could just move out from this zone, or fight within it. Usually, though, these zones that Nathan could create were only a little bigger than a human. He could fit in a small group, but that was it.

That was when a certain individual had approached him, claiming he had a use for his powers. Handing him a crystal the military man had never seen before, he had given him a task. A task to create a large bubble that would cover the entire area, so it was unable to be seen. Stopping a certain individual from using his powers inside.

The crystal that had been handed over to him, was an enhancement crystal that would boost an ability users powers when used. The world had only known about beast planets for a short amount of time. As they mined into the core they discover new things and new crystals all the time. With anything new discovered to be sent back to the lab.

Of course, one of the groups that was focused on mining the beast planets more than any other, was the military and it looked like they had been keeping some of their discoveries a secret.

From the beginning, Nathan had known about the trap that awaited Quinn, because he would play a massive part of it. After Quinn failed to pick up on his first lie, he knew that the Cursed faction had merely bluffed and had no way, other than instinct, to tell when he was lying or telling the truth.

Quinn had sealed his own fate when he had refrained from using the Influence skill on Nathan… because he trusted him. Trusted that he was telling the truth… which only served to make the guilt and pain in Nathan so much more worse.

'I've done my part, Quinn, and it may be wrong of me to say this…but I'm rooting for you. Get out of there and live, and pay them back for all they have done!'

——

Inside the dark area, Quinn could see countless people entering the room. He wasn't mistaken like he first thought himself, that's exactly what they were, people. Every single one of them looked like normal humans. Hundreds of them, but something was clearly wrong.

Their eyes looked dull, a bit like they were asleep, and their movement was slow.

'Their condition reminds me of the Marked back then with the Demon tier tree… they look too different to be clones, so are all of them being controlled somehow?'

Channelling his power, Quinn's eyes started to glow red. The people were coming from all directions, but with his powers he wondered if he could still command them. He couldn't imagine that every single one of them had been implanted with some type of Qi command.

"Stop!" Quinn shouted, hoping it would do something, but they continued to move towards him. He imagined that somewhere Zero was watching his futile attempt and laughing at the scene.

'You… you don't want to kill them, do you?' Ray asked, noticing that Quinn seemed hesitant.

'I've killed many times in the past, and perhaps not all of them deserved it, but… with them being controlled like they are at the moment, it doesn't feel right. I don't think they're members of Pure, so I would rather not kill people who might have gotten dragged into this mess.'

Seeing that his Influence skill didn't work, Quinn rushed over to one, who had attempted to hit him. As soon as the Vampire Lord got within a certain range, the figure swung its arms at a speed that surpassed a regular human by far. However, it was nothing to Quinn, who managed to get behind them and placed his hand on top of their head.

'This doesn't make any sense. I can't feel any Qi in their body, so then why isn't my Influence skill working on them?'

"If anyone can speak, speak now!" Quinn demanded, expecting at least one of the hundreds to explain the situation. Alas, not a single one spoke up, instead something strange started to happen to the one that Quinn was holding onto.

His body started to change in front of his eyes, and it appeared to start a chain reaction. The other followed suit, their skin began changing in colour, going to a pale green, while their muscles were budding in front of him.

Two of their front teeth were forming into large tusks right in front of his eyes. The ears started to elongate and form downwards, growing four times the size, and the hair started to form into something that resembled a snake. Each strand individually strong, moving as if it was alive.

Since Quinn still had his hand held onto the one in front of him, he could tell that there was energy growing inside them, energy that was similar to that of a beast.

'Pure… does this mean they were finally successful in creating a beast that they could control? Similar to that of the Dalki?' Quinn worried

When learning of what they planned to do, it sounded far-fetched. Since the Dalki had come from similar means, it was possible that they might create another race similar to the Dalki. However, it was apparent that Pure had found a way to make them subservient.

'I've seen something like this before.' Ray spoke up. 'This scene reminds me of the beasting process during my time. Humans used beast crystals on themselves to evolve. Although…during my time there was great risk.'

Letting go, Quinn wanted to see what exactly these new beasts could do. Just how dangerous they were, With all of them around him.

'What… this has happened before in the past?' Quinn asked.

'Yes, but that was out of their own will. They would retain their human rationality, but the ones in front of you are somehow being controlled. I'm afraid you don't have the time to find a non-lethal way to get past them.'

Quinn was still wondering what type of beast they might have used to create them. All of them looked the same. The Dalki were created from a dragon like-beast giving them extra power, but what about these guys? Ray was right as well, these people were dangerous, and there was no way out for him at the moment.

Soon, with all the new Pure beasts coming towards him, Quinn activated a power he still did have. Using the third stage Qi, he pushed it out as a wave, knocking over all the beasts onto the floor. It looked strange, they couldn't even get close to him, and they suddenly fell out of nowhere. All apart from one, Quinn had purposely left a gap in his third stage of Qi to let one through.

"I'm sorry.' Quinn said, as he dodged a claw from one of them. Looking at the arm closely, he could see a slime-like substance, unsure what it could do. With another punch, Quinn grabbed the creature's hand, as he tried to get a read on its strength.

With these two simple movements, Quinn could tell that these humanoid beasts that had been created by Pure were strong. He felt that they might rival a one spiked Dalki, yet no more than that. Still, if they had solved the problem that the Dalki had with producing more, and were willing to use endless humans, then they would have a frightening force at their disposal.

At the same time, it also meant down the line they could create more.

While holding onto the creature's hand the hair of the creature moved trying to wrap around his neck, but with the third stage of Qi, Quinn didn't even have to lift a finger to push it away. Finally, used a Blood spray punch towards its stomach to end it. A large hole replaced its former mid section, and blood came shooting out from the beast's body, a mixture of black and red.

'This blood…smells strange.' Quinn noted, as he tried to make his mind numb to what he was about to do.

"I'll end all of your pain."

# Chapter 1446 - Pure Beasts
After breaking out of their container, the vampires discovered that a lot of the gas that had already entered their bodies continued affecting them. In fact, it had become most obvious when they had punched to break out of the glass. Each one of them felt that their strength had weakened slightly. Even if none of them would say anything, Vincent could tell that they were a few concerned and hiding it on their face.

'Still, it shouldn't be a problem for whatever we face, but I can't help but worry about what is going on in there. Quinn, what exactly is taking you so long?' Vincent was worried about his descendant.

Before the vampires started to move, they could feel something moving under the stage. Something else that was mechanical. The vibration could mostly be felt towards their right side, where the south glass container was. They could see the back of the container opening up. In an instant, green coloured humanoid beasts began storming into the glass container, filling it up bit by bit. They hadn't attacked the container but just stood there looking towards the leaders.

"Are they human?" Sunny asked.

"If they're human, then I'm ugly." Fex commented on the situation that looked to be worsening by the second. Right after it looked like all of those inside the glass container had bashed on it with their hands, breaking it with ease, and they were faced with a large hostile force.

"There are humans mixed in with them." Fex clarified, as he noticed some at the back who hadn't fully transformed yet. It was hard for the vampires to figure out if they were beasts or humans. Their smell was a mixture of both, and seeing their forms it seems that way as well. Unlike the Dalki though, they seemed to be somewhat in a permanently changed state.

"Sh*t… how many of those apes are there?" Nicu asked, drawing his sword. After breaking out of the glass, more and more were storming out, and their numbers had gone from dozens, to several hundreds, and might reach a thousand if this continued.

"If they're humans, then this should work." Muka said, running first into the army of beasts. "She soon reached them when they were only a quarter way past the field, she took off her helmet for a few seconds.

"Halt!" She shouted, but it seemed like despite her Influence skill being abnormally strong, forcing her to wear a helmet to not accidentally set it off, right now it was proving completely ineffective. A secret she hadn't quite told the others yet.

"Muka, get back here! It doesn't look like your Luck is going to help you much here!" Vincent shouted, but the one to act before she got somewhat flattened by the stampede was Lee. A piece of string wrapped around the Royal Knight and pulled her out of the area quickly.

"Quinn isn't here, what do we do? Who's in charge?" Jake panicked. "The King didn't want us to hurt humans, but can those things even be called that? They also look like they're very much looking forward to hurting us!"

In this type of situation, usually one of the two Royal Knights would take charge, but they didn't exactly instil hope. Their inexperience was showing, in that Fex was panicking, and Muka's idea having outright failed.

That's when Vincent stepped forward.

"I'll speak on behalf of Quinn in this situation. Do your best to refrain from killing them. That being said, your life is more important than theirs. If you don't have any other choice, then don't hesitate. None of you are dying today!" The tenth leader shouted.

The next second, from one of the snake-like strands of hair, on top of those monsters had opened wide and fired out a strange green liquid aimed at Vincent. The old vampire avoided the projectile, making it hit the ground, which started to melt upon contact

Retaliating, the tenth leader used a Blood swipe, successfully hitting the beast, which had lifted its hands in protection. Its forearms revealed strange hard scales, and aside from being pushed back a few meters, only a scratch was left.

'Oh…these are a little strong, maybe… we might have to use them sooner than we thought.'

The thousand or so beasts had almost reached the vampire leaders at once, but each one of them was strong. Jin was able to use his exploding blood to hit them all and stop them from advancing too far. While being careful about the power of his ability he used. Meanwhile, the other leaders were using their martial arts and blood powers to pierce their skin.

Having learned their lesson, they all avoided the forearms, which had proven to be the hardest part of their body. This meant that they were far easier to kill compared to the Dalki, though these beasts did have their own advantages.

For one, the hair on the beast's body allowed them to attack at midrange, and the acid they produced was enough to cause burns on the vampire leaders' skin. During the fight, Jake had suffered a hit, and it was a place where he hadn't used Blood hardening.

The pain was getting to him, a vampire lord, and it was burning quite quickly. Luckily, Katori, who was by his side, had sliced the skin off, and quickly used her ability as the second leader to reverse it back to the state it was once at.

"If you were going to do that, did you need to cut it off!" Jake shouted.

"Everyone, do your best to avoid their acid! If you're hit, come to me!" She shouted.

Thanks to the warning, they were being more cautious, and the leaders had decided to protect the second leader, understanding how valuable her ability would be.

Another advantage the beasts displayed were their flexible bodies. Some of those fighting hadn't fully transformed into a beast state, and it looked almost as if just their hands had been transformed.

The beasts with the beast armour seemed to be getting a boost from that as well. At the same time, since they weren't actually beasts, they didn't follow a type of attack pattern, each one of these were individual in their powers.

Ultimately, most leaders stopped holding back, utilising more deadly attacks, hoping to lower their numbers.

'Vampires may have great stamina, but using our blood powers like this will exhaust us.'' Vincent thought, as he grabbed one of the Pure beasts and used its shoulders to jump off. Using his elevated position he quickly checked out the situation in the south container.

'Just how many… did they do this too?' Vincent wondered, as he could see more and more people coming from the south container. More and more of the enemy. The only good thing was it was impossible for them all to fight them at once, at the same time.

It was annoying as more and more of those creatures began firing the strange acid from their hair.

'If these are humans and our Influence skill isn't working on them, then there has to be someone controlling them. Think… Pure, they were capturing those from the Bree family, in order to control beasts… is it someone from the Bree family then that's controlling them? Would that even work?' Vincent contemplated going out on his own, to find whoever controlled them.

Unfortunately, he was unable to see anyone that stuck out among the crowd, and he was worried about how the other leaders would fare without him helping out. For once, everyone was working together, and it was only thanks to that they were able to somewhat survive the onslaught.

'If this continues, eventually… I will have to order them to use it.'

*****

# Chapter 1447 - A Worse Threat (Part 1)
Just like in the main arena, right now Quinn was having to fight off an endless stream of Pure Beasts. He had been taking them out one by one, rather than use an attack targeting multiple ones. There were many ways Quinn could have used a number of his skills to take out the endless army, yet he didn't and Ray, who was with him in the system, knew why.

The Cursed faction leader was still trying to find some way to save them. Each time he killed one of the Pure Beasts, his ancestor could see that Quinn's fists hesitated for a fraction of a second. With his strength a single blow in the right place was enough to finish them. Nevertheless, he did what needed to be done, and the Pure Beasts were falling to the floor.

Rising above them, Quinn lept to the air and used his gauntlet to cling onto the side of the arena walls. He readied his fist trying to punch it. As it slammed into the wall a clang was heard and an indent was made but there was nothing else.

'How thick are these walls. I've never seen so much Glathrium being used?' Quinn thought.

Glathrium was apparently meant to be a rare substance, but he didn't think that was the case with how much he could currently see. Perhaps the Board members were the ones that were creating an artificial demand by limiting its use, and that way raising the price. After learning what type of people they really were, nothing would surprise him anymore about their scummy ways.

As Quinn readied himself to punch the wall once more, several of the Pure beasts started to climb on top of each other, creating a pile to reach him and at the same time they fired from their hair the green substance. Quinn would fire back at the green substance hitting it with his blood swipes, as he quickly leapt down and headed back to the floor.

Fortunately, the Blood armour he was currently wearing allowed him to use his own Blood powers non-stop. Not only did Quinn use that to shield himself from the special spit their hair was producing, and was able to channel blood into his attacks, as he kicked them, punched and kneed and elbowed his enemies.

While fighting, Quinn noticed that some of them were changing their appearance. After sustaining enough injuries, they would eventually revert to being somewhat human. Unfortunately, it didn't stop them from attacking him, though, yet the power difference was apparent.

All of that reminded him awfully of Borden, who was quite different compared to the rest of the Dalki.

'What is this?' Quinn thought.

'I'm pretty sure it's the beasting process like I said before.' His ancestor answered. 'There has been a great difference between my time and yours, but after watching them for a while I'm sure it's something similar.

'In the past, humans were weak, and many of them needed a boost in fighting power, so what better way then to use the strong beasts that they needed to go against. Later on, they found a way for humans to absorb the essence of a beast crystal, changing their body into this. However, it came with great risks. One required strong power to control the change, not just anyone could do such a thing.

'At the same time, to minimise the risk, you wouldn't go for a high tier beast, but would usually start from the ground up with a Basic tier crystals, then Intermediate and so on, but this…'

Just then, Quin grabbed the serpent-like hair, and pulled one of the beast's heads down while slamming his knee into its face. Quickly, the vampire spun around and delivered a kick, towards one that had managed to get behind him, sending it flying through the air.

'This… they don't feel like they absorbed the essence of only one beast.' Ray continued. 'It's almost like a chimaera of some sorts. Like they have mixed multiple beasts crystals into the humans.'

Quinn couldn't agree more, the claws, the scales, and the hair. Each one of them had different properties, and he felt as if he was fighting multiple beasts at once. It was why they were a little more difficult than regular beasts to fight, but listening to Ray speak, Quinn found something interesting in what he had said.

'Explain to me, if this would be the beasting process, then what level do you think these beasts were at?' Quinn asked.

Ray had been watching them fight for a while now, and was thinking.

'It's hard to say, since I don't know how strong the humans were beforehand. If the human was already strong, even a Basic tier beast crystal would see them gain a huge boost by giving them a beast-like body and powers. With many beasts seemingly being used, I can only assume it would further strengthen them. However, these guys in their human form seem incredibly weak, so my guess would be an Intermediate tier… King tier at best.'

'Did he just say Intermediate tier… is the strength of an Intermediate beast mixed with humans?'

The Dalki and the beast in front of them were both quite different yet similar. One method was combining the powers of a beast with a human, while the other was creating a new species with human and beast DNA.

If what Ray said was true though…

'How strong would a human be if he were to go through this beasting process with a Demon tier beast crystal?' Quinn asked.

'I have no idea.' Ray replied. 'During my time, that never happened. It would have most likely just killed any human that tried to go through such a thing, but if it was possible then judging by the situation you are in now, they would create something that was beyond a demon tier.'

Although Quinn knew somewhat what the answer was going to be, he was hoping he wouldn't have heard that answer.

'I wanted to find a way to help them, but I can't find the one controlling them, and it looks like my abilities aren't going to come back. The others are in trouble so I have to get out of here.' Quinn said to himself.

As he raised his hand, blood started to gather not just from within himself, but from all the others that had been hurt as well.

——

Inside the room, everyone was slowly watching the glowing eyes of what was in front of them. For some reason, those in the room were reluctant to move, it was as if they knew whoever was to act first would be the one that needed to deal with the Pure member, it also was clear to them that something had changed with the said person.

And, although Leo and Such were able to see better during the night, the same couldn't exactly be said for them in the smoke, which was making it hard to see anyone's position.

'The smoke is still pouring into the room now.' Logan noticed. 'I need to disable them somehow, if I get a hold onto the machines. Then I might be able to use my soul weapon, but I have a feeling that I won't be able to freely move.'

Instead, Logan decided to use what little spiders he had left. He no longer had enough to create his regular suit of armour and had already used a good amount of them creating the masks for those in the Graylash family.

They could perhaps disable the machine somehow, if they found the right component, but it would take some time. Still,it made Logan wonder why one person hadn't acted yet. There was one who was in the room with them that had strength that equalled Sil at times. Surely he should have been able to break out of the room.

When Sil went to turn his head to look in his direction, suddenly, they heard a thud, as another member of their group had passed out and had fallen to the floor.

Sera had just summoned a sword in his hand, and it looked like he was ready to act, but before he did, he had collapsed onto the ground as well.

"That idiot!" A voice said.

*****

# Chapter 1448 - A Worse Threat (Part 2)
"That idiot!" A voice was heard. Due to the certain individual who had spoken a lot before, the others were able to recognise the voice. It was coming from Abdul, the Unranked who stood next to Sera's side most of the time. "You didn't even bother covering your mouth! Did you think this thing wouldn't affect you or something?"

Abdul, complained while having created a makeshift mask from ripping a piece from his shirt. The two were towards the back of the room, more so than the others, which was why the gas had taken longer to affect them compared to everyone else.

'I guess even if they have that immense power, there are some things that even affect them.' Leo concluded.

Just because Sera had the power of a God residing in him, didn't mean his body wasn't that of a human's. Perhaps an enhanced human, but a human nonetheless, which meant that even he suffered the smoke's effect. Alas, this God of War had been too stubborn to believe that he would fall to such a thing.

"It looks like our strongest are falling in the room one by one, and we're too egoistic to have to deal with this mess." Sach pointed out, as he got into a fighting stance, standing by Leo's side. He looked at Mona, Sil, and now Sera who had all collapsed.

The problem was, it wasn't exactly like the vampires were unaffected by the smoke, they just had more resistance to it. The sound of Agent 3 could be heard moving, and Sach decided to meet him head-on.

"Let me take care of this!" Sach shouted, going in front of the Vampire Knight.

'If I take the first blow, then it will give the chance for Leo to strike!' Was the thought running through the Supreme Commander's head, and it seemed like Leo was following along with the plan, following a short distance behind him.

However, a large fist of what looked to be raw muscle with no skin came out and hit Sach. He was able to lift his knee to protect himself. With his ability and new vampire body, he should have been able to withstand any blow, and this fact was proven in the came. The strike that hit him though wasn't just powerful, it had the power of Qi behind it.

Sach could feel his cells reacting strangely as an explosive power hit him, sending him flying back and hitting against the wall. Once again, the bones in his knees, he could feel they had slightly fractured but worst of all, it didn't seem to be healing like it usually would have.

'I can still use my leg. Guess I'm lucky it's not broken, but if anyone else gets hit by him it won't end well for us.'

Leo, noticed the other hand come towards him, and activated his soul weapon. Using it, he was able to redirect the punch over to the side. He didn't use too much of his power, afraid that it would drain him quickly.

Since his last fights he knew now that when he was facing stronger opponents, it was best if he naturally deflected the attack while only using part of his soul weapon's ability to redirect the aura. There was no way for him to increase the amount of MC cells in his body so instead he needed to put each one to better use.

Using his skill, the hand missed and went past him, and now Leo had an arm that was prime for chopping off.

With his blade he struck down, making sure to coat it in Qi, and he could see it quickly cutting through the muscular red flesh. His second stage Qi made it as sharp as ever. However, as it reached halfway something strange happened. It looked as if the muscles on the arm were alive, as they were cut and detached from the hand, they started to wrap around the sword, almost holding it in place. Each strand moving individually holding onto it tight.

The sword also looked to be doing nothing, as the muscles themselves were now coated in Qi as well.

'I can feel the strong Qi through this beast's body! How can a beast use Qi?' Leo wondered.

'Do you need my help?'

'Not yet…if it comes to it, I'll gladly fight this thing together, though.' Leo replied to his familiar.

Right now he had to figure out the problem in front of him, for even with his second stage of Qi it seemed that he was struggling to pull out his blade. Grim and Owen had been busy with Logan trying to find a way to get rid of the smoke, or break out of the room.

Unfortunately, they haven't quite figured out a way just yet. In the first place, Grim and Owen's strength were in their abilities, yet it seemed to have no effect on the glass. Seeing that Leo and Sach might be in trouble, they could see the creature now fully as it walked up to Leo. On its back, it had what looked like countless bones sticking out from it. They were in no shape or form, but just looked like multiple hands dangling from its back.

Agent 3, was roughly the same size as a Dalki, but its body was something else. Completely covered in flesh, with the same markings of white in certain places. It didn't look like a beast, but something that came from the world of the undead itself.

'We have to try and get out of this place!' Logan concluded since his spiders were taking too long. Instead he took off the casing from his arm, which revealed his Dalki self underneath. The Graylash family were too focused to be in shock, as Logan pulled back and threw a punch towards the glass as hard as he could.

When it hit though it did little to nothing.

'Damn it, my strength is not enough!'

"Hut me, cut my arm!" Logan demanded from the two.

Owen was a bit hesitant, but Grim had caught on to what the boy was trying to do. A single finger was coating in lighting, as Grim went to cut Logan's Dalki arm as much as possible. Now, Logan could feel the Dalki strength rising in him.

He punched the wall again, and this time there had been a slight crack in it.

"More!" Logan shouted, but his arm was already bleeding heavily and blood was dripping on the floor.

"The boy could die." Owen said concerned.

Seeing this, the two thought of another solution and could see that the beast was getting ready to attack Leo again. Trying to stop his advance, the two were getting ready to attack the beast when a large figure handed them something. They were surprised that it was two women, Samantha and Mona. He shoved them forward quickly, trying to empathise with something.

"I think he wants us to look after them." Grim figured out.

'Isn't this the beast that Mona was controlling? Is it acting on its own? I thought in situations like this, the tamed beast is meant to do whatever it can to protect its owner…so what is this?' Owen wondered while holding onto Mona.

The next second, the large figure started to charge straight towards Agent 3 with no fear at all. It wasn't affected by any of the gas in the slightest, and continued to run forward until it tackled the Pure agent. It also grabbed onto both of its arms and gripped it with as much strength as possible, causing it to finally let go of Leo's sword.

Before any of them could react, it had crashed through the back of the glass container, shattering it, and the two were falling onto the arena stage. The two looked to be struggling mid flight, but the large figure was still holding onto the box. Until, he eventually dropped the box, and it fell to the ground. The impact had caused the latch to open, and a round object could be seen rolling out.

*****

# Chapter 1449 - Looking For Something?
The glass used to contain them was clearly robust, at least as strong as Glathrium if not stronger. As such, it came as a real shock, when the humanoid beast that Mona had brought along, had managed to tackle Agent 3 directly out of the window, breaking through as if it had been normal glass.

'Did I weaken it enough with my punch?' Logan wondered. 'No, the glass still should have been plenty strong on his side, yet he broke it with ease.'

Logan was one of the few people who actually knew who and what was hidden inside the armour. Ignoring the 'how' of the matter, the glass breaking was actually good news for the rest of them. The smoke started to leave the container as it escaped and dispersed into the air. Those that had been affected by the smoke, though, continued to sleep. As for how long, it would depend on their own constitution, most likely.

Those who saw the glass break were now concerned about two things. Immediately, they could hear a great noise, resembling the sounds of fighting. It seemed the glass container had also been quite soundproof, as for the other thing they had to keep in mind, it was Agent 3.

However, they were distracted because when they peeked their heads out, they could see an enormous number of green coloured figures. At the moment, the vampires were fighting off the horde of Pure Beasts, using everything they could, and they had somewhat cleared an area around them.

It was apparent that they had already killed quite a few of the strange beasts, as their bodies could be seen piled on top of each other.

"My word…what is all of this?" Owen couldn't help but let out. Even he had never expected to see such a scene. Trying to sense their energy, Leo could tell that all of these things were just like Agent 3. The source of red energy was different, and the ones that were fighting out there didn't have the power of Qi, yet he could tell that the others were struggling.

'Where is Chris? If he left his other Agent here, he shouldn't be too far?' Leo thought as he tried to sense him, but before he could even try to locate and track him down, he could see another problem coming towards them.

The issue that the vampires were dealing with, was soon becoming theirs as well. The green coloured beasts created that were at the edge of the stadium had also noticed the shattering glass. Turning their heads, they headed over to the 'human group.

"The others aren't waking up!" Abdul shouted. "We have to protect them!"

They couldn't agree more, nearly all of them left the glass container. They could see the Pure Beasts climbing on top of the stage, while Abdul remained in the glass container, drawing his bow and quickly aiming at them.

He pulled on the string of the weapon without using an arrow. However, once he had let go, it struck one of the beasts who had just made it to the top of the stands where the others were. It immediately fell as blood came out from its chest.

Abdul, was a user of the wind ability, and he was a strong one at that. Putting his ability with his good beast weapon, he was quite the dangerous fighter, he just hadn't been able to show it off due to him losing to one of the vampires from before.

Still, on top of the Pure Beasts that were coming towards them, there was another figure that had stood up from the ground. It was a large man wearing armour. He looked around as if he was looking for something, and soon after, Agent 3 stood there. Now out of the smoke, his figure looked even more menacing.

The first thing the Pure agent did was attempt to punch the one who had grabbed him. The other figure reacted by summoning out a type of large shield. It was mainly black, with the outside covered in a strange white material. On a closer look, it looked to have been made out of bones, but they were unsure if that was the case or not.

The shield took the strong blow, and even then the punch didn't seem to affect him as much as the others. Pushing forward, he had even pushed back Agent 3 slightly.

'That…thing… it was able to take the strong blow that I couldn't?' Sach was baffled as he witnessed it. Apparently there had been a hidden monster among all of them. Still, there were some strange actions, since the figure seemed to be more bothered about whatever it was looking for than the fight.

After blocking one bunch, Agent 3 started to punch the shield in quick succession. With this, it looked like the blows were getting through as they were being pushed back into the stands. Just then as well, one of the beasts kept and looked like it was going after the figure, but before it reached. It was zapped with lighting.

"Protect the big guy!" Owen shouted.

The others seemed to agree as they were already moving in front of him. Those that were still conscious had formed a type of circle. They also wanted to protect the glass container slightly above, as well as the one fighting. If they could, they wanted to help the figure as well. However, the Pure Beasts coming towards them were far too much.

"Now that we're out of the game, we can show a bit more of our powers!" Grim said, as lightning hit him and his whole body started to spark up. With his power even greater than before, he fired out towards all of those in front of them.

To them, they were just wild beasts that were attacking, similar to that of the Dalki.

Agent 3 seemed to change his tactic, as his attacks were unable to break that shield. When it punched again, his hand soon changed into several tentacles. The muscles on his arm had stretched and split, and started to spread around the shield itself.

It looked as if it was consuming the shield. Agent 3 then tried to yank it, but the large figure also pulled back, and it came down to a battle of strength between the two of them. Something soon started to form on the other hand of the figure. It looked like a sword, similarly crafted from bones.

Using it, the armoured creature swung down on the strange tentacles and managed to slice off the limbs that even Leo had been unable to.

'It's not even using Qi… just what is that thing? It nearly has the same strength as Quinn. The only figures that have great strength are those like Linda or Peter.' Leo had learned a little about the undead classes that could be made from vampires, but this was beyond anything he had seen before.

Still, Agent 3 moved back after parts of its arm had been sliced off, and the wriggling parts of his body on the floor started to move and return to his limb. Soon they joined up, and his arm was back in the shape it once was.

Rather than use this opportunity to strike down his opponent, they could see that the figure was still busy looking around. Finally, it seemed to have found what it was looking for, as it immediately started to run towards a certain direction. The others who would glance at the fight from time to time were finding its actions incredibly strange, questioning whether it had chosen to abandon them all of a sudden.

That didn't make sense though since it had yet to suffer any injuries, and it had been doing extremely. In the midst of its running, Agent 3 stretched out its arm once more. Changing it into a tentacle-like form.

It grabbed onto one of the figure's legs and pulled him to the ground. While on the floor. The figure reached out as if it was just about to grab for something. It quickly turned around and did something that none of them expected. Rather than use its sword to attack the tentacles, it had decided to cut off its own leg.

At the same time, its shield and sword disappeared into particles as if they had never existed to begin with. Not looking back, it desperately crawled across the floor until it leaped onto the other side, all to grab what it was looking for.

Everyone had seen this desperate act, and they weren't sure why it was trying to do all of this. Then suddenly, from where it had cut off its leg, bone started to grow. It had the shape of a foot but no flesh, allowing it to stand up.

When it did, they all could now see what it was holding in its hands.

"Is that a head?!" Abdul called out.

Not only that, but it had a wide smile, with eyes that looked like they never blinked, yet the most shocking thing was… that many of them recognised exactly who the figure was.

"Old man… what has happened to you?" Sach asked, feeling incredibly saddened.

*****

# Chapter 1450 - The Head's Power
The vampire leaders were still in the middle of their endless battle, and at this rate, Vincent wasn't so sure if his backup plan would work as he had strategized.

'If times get desperate, I thought maybe the others would use their inner blood weapon.' Vincent thought. 'These beasts are strong, but from the fights, they should have realized that we wouldn't just fall to these guys. That was why I thought the real threat would come later…but I didn't see anything. Are they planning to wear us down with countless numbers? This whole situation reminds me of Quinn when he was on Blade island.'

The soul weapon and blood weapon had some differences. For instance, using a soul weapon would consume a large amount of MC cells, so it was considered the final move or a last resort at times. However, a blood weapon could be used constantly, the only downside being that there needed to be blood to use it. And there was plenty of blood around them, so that wasn't the problem; however, after running some tests, Vincent had found out something that all of the vampire leaders knew as well.

Unlike the other blood weapons made from the dead vampires, this was created from the blood crystal within their bodies. This meant that if they destroyed the blood weapon itself, it would also affect the user.

This was something they all felt, which was also why they wouldn't just use it as they wished. It was a double-edged sword, but one only the vampires knew.

At that moment, Vincent saw the glass break from the other side and two large figures falling from the container. Since the vampires were doing well and could probably keep this up for a little longer, Vincent started to make his way through the crowd, splitting from the circle the leaders had made.

"He is just like the king. He seems to care more about the humans than his own fellow vampires," Jake commented.

"Hey," Jin shouted as he had stopped using his explosive powers. Vampires could only use their abilities so much, and seeing that even if he had used his ability completely, it wouldn't get rid of the problem, he was starting to save it from more serious situations.

"Remember, Vincent already left us once. He has no reason to protect us… and are you saying that you are too weak that you can't survive without him?"

This comment somewhat grimaced Jake, and he turned this embarrassment into anger, throwing out a fist and striking one of the beasts right in the face.

Upon getting close, Vincent could see that the humans were doing a good job protecting themselves; after all, these were strong, but some of them weren't present. He could only speculate that the gas had got to them.

Still, what he was more concerned about was the large figure.

'That Dullahan…I guess if the legends of its powers are true, then there is no reason for us to worry.' Vincent thought.

Right now, everyone could see that the large figure had grabbed an object, and by his side, it was Oscar's face on the head, only it had a constant creepy smile that looked like it was somewhat stuck.

'Oscar… you're still alive… but Quinn said… he couldn't save you.' Something was telling Sach that this wasn't the same Oscar that he knew; perhaps it was his nose or something else, but even Owen had the same feeling as they looked at a great man that once stood by their side fighting and protecting their lives.

While his head was detached from his body of all things.

'Even in death, you are still helping us! Which means I can't slack either!' Sach went for a strong thigh kick hitting one of the beasts into another, and was hoping to turn around and help Oscar, but more were upon him.

"Just let him focus on his own fight!" Owen shouted. "Believe in our old ally!"

'The only good thing is…that at least Samantha is asleep not to witness this. I guess that's why Mona had placed all that armour on him.' Sach guessed.

Since getting his head, it now looked like Oscar was fully focused on the person in front of him. He then held out his head with one hand towards Pure's Agent Three. At the same time, the bone sword appeared in his other hand.

It was clear that something strange was happening. Because as Oscar moved forward still with his own head shoved in front of him, for some reason, Agent three wasn't moving at all. It was as if his feet were stuck.

"Arghhh!" Agent Three screamed, and the muscles on his body ripped apart, forming the tentacles again and heading straight for Oscar. At that moment, he shoved his sword into the ground, and what looked like large white spikes shot up from the ground. They looked like large cut human bones, and in that instant, each of them pierced through the tentacles and hands formed on the end, grabbing onto the strange tentacles holding them in place.

Now, running forward, Oscar swung his sword aiming to slash Agent Three's head, but at that moment, the latter suddenly moved and escaped within a breath's time. Now, just when Agent Three was ready to strike again, Oscar lifted up his head again and pushed it directly in front of the latter's face, and once again, Agent Three froze.

'It seems the rumours are true. In front of the Dullahan, it's impossible to escape once its real eyes are set on you… the body becomes immobile.' Vincent thought, looking at the fight that was going on.

Although Agent Three could not move his legs, he could still move his arms and the rest of his body. He also noticed that he could move his legs again when it tried to attack until he lifted his head. Knowing this, Agent three was ready to make a comeback. He waited for the next attack.

That was until he felt several bones pierce his body from below. The same that had grabbed his tentacles had now gone through his legs, but the worst part was, he could see from the top of the spike-bones, that hands were forming on them.

Each of these bone hands grabbed onto a part of the body with great strength holding Agent Three in place. They had even gone through his hands, and because of this newfound grip, the former was unable to move at all.

It looked like an adult toying with a child. One long bone then arose from the ground where Oscar was standing and reached up to the height of his head. The bone then started to form a hand and held his head in place, still directly looking at Agent Three.

Since Agent Three couldn't move his legs, he couldn't use the full strength of his whole body either, the hands only needed to restrict the muscle in each area, but it didn't make sense. How could just bones by holding down someone who already had great strength?

Now that the bone was holding up Oscar's head, Oscar had two hands free and placed one on top of Agent three's head, holding it still. Then with the other hand, the bone sword was ready. He twisted his body slightly and swung the sword with his full strength, slicing Agent Three's head off in one go.

The bones then went back into the ground, no longer holding up Agent Three's body, allowing it to fall onto the ground. While only the bone holding up his own head remained. Then with the head of agent three in his hand, he stabbed it with his sword holding it up for all the others to see as if he was a General in the olden days, having successfully beheaded the enemy leader.

'That…was far more impressive than I thought… what monster did you create, Eno.' Vincent thought.

Even then, though, Oscar wasn't done yet. As he could see, there was still a lot more to be done. The flesh of the head started to fall as if it was melting, only leaving the bone. Then he pushed the skull into his own body if he had somewhat absorbed it.

Oscar walked over to where his leg was lying. Picking it up, he easily reattached it by just placing his leg where his foot once was, retracting the new bone that had grown.

From his position, an intense green light began to glow, and a few seconds later, a large black horse appeared—green smoke blowing from its nostrils. Immediately, Oscar leapt onto the horse's back, and the weapon in his hand started to form into something else. It shifted from a sword into something longer, something similar to a whip that looked to have been made from a Human spine.

"That thing…could be troublesome." Chris thought as he had seen everything the legendary Dullahan could do.

*****

# Chapter 1451 - C Sample B Sample
Everyone was taking note of what Oscar was up to for one reason or another. For instance, they wanted to know what he had become. Clearly, his head was detached from his body, and somehow he was still moving and alive. Even his strength was different from before.

At the same time, they had all felt Agent Three's strength for a brief moment, and they could tell he was strong. This was why they were regularly paying attention to the fight, and they had seen that Oscar had dominated Agent Three throughout the whole fight.

Oscar had strength before, his soul weapon was unique, and he was one of the best users of his earth ability. Still, without his demon tier weapon, many wondered whether he could or should still be considered one of the strongest along with the big four.

Which was why the military needed more strong figures other than just Oscar. However, after seeing what he had just done, without a doubt, he was now deserving to be called one of the strongest.

Not only that, but he had defeated Agent three and had done it in such a fearful and aggressive way, that the rest of them were frightened. Still, at least he was on our side… was what they were thinking.

Moments later, after Agent Three's death, they all witnessed Oscar summoning a large black horse, and it looked just as frightening as Oscar's face himself.

It was incredibly muscular and larger than any horse they had ever seen. They felt as if it would be able to stomp anything that got in its path with its strong front legs. However, it was clearly a magical beast, as the green mist from its nostrils indicated so.

It was at that moment that Leo, too, felt something coming out from his body, and before he knew it, Ovin had been summoned as a black cat appeared in front of Leo. The first thing it did was pounce on one of the enemies in front of him, pushing it back with its strength and causing the Pure beast to fall to the ground.

Then it performed a backflip and landed on the floor.

'I didn't summon you…what are you doing?' Leo asked.

"I'm sorry, but it's not my fault," Ovin shrugged, and when it spoke, others around could hear it as well. They were starting to wonder if they were losing their mind. "It's because of him." Ovin pointed at the horse with his paw.

"The power of the four kings is strong… and it drew me out. Besides, I can't let him do all the work and show up. It's my time to shine as well. Who knows, maybe the four kings will have some reunion at some point." Ovin said, licking its paw.

"Everyone, the beasts have started to move. Fall back! I can't kill them fast enough!" Abdul shouted.

He had been firing arrows after arrows at the few that managed to get through and headed for the glass container, but his MC cells were lowering, and it looked like now that Agent Three had failed at its task, the beasts were going around the large figure with the horse and was heading towards the glass container.

Witnessing this, the others listened to Abdul and fell back. They had only gone out there to make sure that no one would interrupt Oscar's fight. Now that was dealt with, they could fall back towards the glass container, just focusing on the enemy in front of them.

Their main priority was protecting those in the glass container. Although the beasts seemed endless, and their numbers still hadn't dwindled, they could deal with this if Sera or Sil woke up.

"The other one is still out there. Is he not going to come back as well?" Abdul asked as he could see that the figure on the horse remained in front, and so did the black cat.

"I think the two of them will just be fine. We should focus on defending this place and looking after the others." Sach answered.

It was true because the second the pure beasts got close to the black horse, it tilted back on its rear legs and slammed them down at the right moment, hitting two of the Pure beasts right on their heads.

Even with the hard scales on their arms, they were crushed under the weight and strength of the familiar. At the same time, its two front legs slammed onto the ground. It sent out a strange green force that stumbled all those in the nearby area.

It was as if they were startled for a few seconds in that small moment.

Oscar then swung his bone-made whip into the Pure beasts, and in the next second, their heads were all rolling onto the floor.

"It looks like you were right when you said we didn't have to worry about him," Grim commented. "What happened to him? He was not like this before."

The answer to this question was what all of them wanted to know.

The horse started to move fast through the tide of Pure beasts, and it looked like a green stream. Whatever the beasts tried to do, the familiar horse, known as one of the kings of the familiar world, was able to stomp through with no problem.

Destroying whatever was in its way, it took out many beasts, and at the same time, Oscar was easily swinging his weapon. For some reason, targeting only their heads. It was hard for the others to tell if he was having fun or not because the head was still firmly held by Oscar's side, and not once did the smile dwindle from its face.

At the same time, Ovin didn't just sit back and watch; he needed to prove why he also was one of the four kings. With his nimble and small body, he was able to jump and avoid being hit. Each time he swiped his paw at the beast's head, it would twist their heads until they would break.

Once in a while, if one of the beasts got too close, he would also breathe out fire.

"A headless horseman! The headless horseman!" Nicu shouted as he sliced down one of the beasts with his sword. "I thought it was only a legend."

"All legends have to stem from somewhere," Katori commented. "Blood fairy is real, and now the Headless Horseman, I wouldn't be surprised if Werewolfs started to make an appearance as well."

The vampires weren't too worried about the headless horseman because the smell coming off Oscar's body. They could tell that it was an undead creature. It was a subclass, so if anything, it was more on their side than the humans.

However, if they had seen its previous action in the glass container form before, perhaps they wouldn't think that too much.

'This is good; with the two familiars out, the rate at which we can take down these beasts is more than the rate at which they are coming. Soon, we can make our move and try to find out who is controlling this, or find a way to close that container where they are all coming from.'

Still watching from an unknown location, Chris let out a big sigh.

"I guess we couldn't have been that lucky that just with Agent Three and the C class samples would be enough to wipe them all out. However, they have done well. I guess it's time to send in the B samples as well then."

Looking up ahead, Vincent was staring at the south container. As the numbers finally decreased, he tried to find a way out of here, out of this situation. That was until he saw something stepping through the glass container.

Instead of the green-colored beasts, there were several red-colored beasts, all varying in different sizes. They looked like walls of flesh, with bones sticking out of their back.

At the same time, Owen and the rest of them witnessed this as well.

"Agent 3 wasn't the only one," Sach said.

*****

# Chapter 1452 - Infuse An Ancient Power
All of the beasts that had entered the arena were coming from the same place. The south container, which at the beginning had remained empty. This was where there would be a continuous stream of beasts and partially transformed humans appearing.

Now though, just as they were about to head to that location, they could see that there was an entire row of the same red type of beast that Oscar had just defeated.

"Although these guys aren't as strong as Agent three and don't have the Qi that he had, they have been mixed with the same beast DNA. You have dealt with an army of the C classes. Let's see you deal with the B classes."

The humans seeing this knew it was trouble and were wondering what their best course of action was. Sach turned his head, thinking it might be best if they tried to run towards the stadium.

Only so many of the beasts would be able to follow them. At the same time, he was sure that those Board members or someone would have had an emergency teleporter to get out of here. As long as they had Logan, they should be able to leave the place relatively easily.

"Leaders! Be ready for a battle, be prepared to use everything you can!" Vincent shouted out. With how well the familiars and Oscar were dealing with the C class beasts, he thought as long as they could deal with the B class, they could somewhat get out of here.

Until something strange had happened, around ten or so B class had entered, but that was all. No more green coloured beast was entering as they had seen before, nor were there any more red coloured beasts either.

'Wait, that's it…if it's just these, if this is the end of their forces, then we can deal with them!' Vincent thought, seeing some type of hope.

What he didn't know, was this wasn't the plan at all, and the one most confused by this was Chris, who had been left in charge of those in the stadium.

'Why are there only ten B class beasts, and there should be even more C classes. What is going on!' Chris thought.

Seeing this, Chris was a little worried that the others might be able to escape from this, so he had no choice. The north container started to open, and then regular humans began to come through. They carried high-grade beast gear on them.

These were members of Pure, and each one of them had been trained in Qi. They, too, were joining the fight. Leaving the humans and vampires with little choice of where to go.

————

Inside the specially made south container, Quinn didn't know how much time had passed, and his mind had become so numb after trying ways to defeat all those around him.

'Endless…how long had they been running experiments on people for. These aren't clones like they were on Blade island. Each one of these are individual people.' Quinn thought.

Quinn had raised the blood from the others that he had hurt around him. He then hardened them into small pellets with his skills, and as the beasts approached him, he shot them all out towards the enemy.

The hardened blood shot out like bullets and went right through whatever defence the beast had, killing them almost immediately. Two rows of the beasts had been killed from this, and still, it seemed like more were coming towards him.

The arena was strange, constantly shifting. Walls would move forward, and a container of beasts would come out from them.

At one point, Quinn had tried to go into one of these containers. Here he could see that there was just a large room filled with beasts, and the container wasn't moving back once he was in it. Finding himself trapped. The enemies would storm behind him. They had somewhat blocked his way out.

It had taken him a Qi blast filled with blood to get out of the area. Leaving countless bodies lying on the floor. It looked like entering the containers wasn't a solution to him getting out of the place.

'How many have I killed already… nearly a 1000 or is it even more?' Quinn thought.

That's when Quinn noticed something else, something that had finally changed. The containers where the green coloured beasts were coming from. When this one opened, it had revealed a room filled with a different beast he hadn't seen before.

These beasts had red coloured skin that looked like the flesh of muscle. On their back, they had several white parts sticking out from it, similar to that of a hedgehog, but the parts looked thick.

'Another type.'

'It wouldn't surprise me that they were experimenting with more beasts. They might have even more than this.' Ray commented.

Quinn was inclined to agree, but then just how many different types of beast did they have. Once again, Quinn wanted to test this hybrid beast's strength. He didn't need long since it threw out its arm from a few metres away, and the red tentacles had latched onto his hand, grabbing onto them tightly.

'This one seems to be more troublesome than the others…I have to get rid of them all!' Quinn shouted as blades started to come out from his arms and had pierced through the tentacles attached to himself.

His soul weapon had been activated, and the twin tail chains were now in his hands. Several tentacles of muscle came towards him, and swinging his arms, Quinn was able to shred through them quickly.

At the same time, any of the green coloured beasts that got in the way were sliced up as well. Bit by bit, Quinn cared less about all those around him, as he could just imagine the danger from above worsening.

However, the flesh that Quinn would cut, even though his twin blades naturally were infused with the power of Qi, he could see them wriggling about on the floor and going back to the beast it had come from.

Unless Quinn killed the beasts, they would continually return to its body and regenerate.

The containers now had a mix of the green coloured beasts and the red ones. The new type of beast seemed endless. With the twin tails, Quinn was slaughtering them, killing them at a quicker rate than he had down before. Also, with his blood control, he could even allow the twin tails to produce blood attacks as well.

However, the new type of beast seemed like they could somewhat join up their walls of muscle and clump together. They had created a system where whatever attack Quinn would give to them, another would attack and heal while another part would come back to get the wall.

Changing thier tactic, the number of creatures that were present on the arena floor was increasing.

Hitting them in the right place, Quinn could still kill them, but by then, another container full of beasts would arrive.

"Arghhh!" Quinn shouted. "This is endless. I have to get out of here."

Seeing the frustration, there was one who thought they could help out.

'Quinn…I still think you can deal with this yourself. You are strong, but you seem to be reluctant to use your absolute blood control.' Ray said.

This was true. Quinn could feel it. Using the blood of others did put a strain on his body. If he was to use it now, who knew if he would be in a good enough condition to help the others.

'Then I have something that might be able to help you out. When you transferred me into the system…I could tell that I might be able to do something…I wasn't sure what it was at first, but it looks like some of my power…had been transferred over to the system as well, and not all of it was left in the tablet.

'Maybe I can help you.'

Just then, as Ray attempted to pass over what leftover power he had, an option had appeared on the system.

[The system has been infused with a strange power]

[The power is now able to be used by the user]

[Would you like to use this power?]

# Chapter 1453 - A Different Evolution
Seeing the low amount of B class beasts come out from the south section was worrying Chris for many reasons. As the highest ranking Pure agent after Zero, he was the most knowledgeable one about this entire operation. Even now he knew what was going on in different areas and also knew about the operations that had been going on in the stadium. Still, he didn't know everything about the man, but with the information he had, he started going through the list of possibilities that might have led to this outcome.

'We've upped our production massively for this event, and we've brought over ten thousand beasts, a mixture of C class and B class. So far, a fifth of their total number should have been released. They were all being held up in the south side of the stadium.

'If they aren't coming out now, there are a few possibilities. Did someone else take care of them? Did they manage to get some type of help we've overlooked? Or… no, it couldn't be… isn't Quinn in the south side at the moment?'' The Pure agent wondered.

That's when he could see something in the distance. Using Qi to enhance his eyesight, he could make out a figure, it was hard but even from where he stood, the energy coming off that beast was something else. The next second, a large red blast came out, and in seconds the ten or so B class beasts that had just come out had been defeated, their bodies no longer even visible.

———

Inside the arena, Quinn had just received a special option from the system, something he had never seen before.

'The system… was it influenced by Ray?' Quinn wondered. 'Before, Eno had been able to influence the system, so I guess it shouldn't be a surprise that Ray can do it as well. He's stuck in my head, and seems to have been integrated into the system somewhat. But what will it do?'

'Do you really have the time to be worrying about that, right now?' Ray rushed his descendant. 'Without your Shadow powers, there really are only a few ways you can get out of this place, so just press yes.'

Seeing that the containers were still moving, and not knowing what was happening outside, was killing Quinn on the inside.

[Yes]

[Energy is now being transferred to the user]

[Your body is changing]

A great red energy escaped from Quinn's body, a force that had pushed back all the beasts. The force was constant like a pulse and each time it hit them they no longer moved. No matter what the beasts tried to do, after a certain point they were unable to approach him.

Meanwhile, Quinn could feel a great pain in his body as it was changing. He quickly took off the Blood armour, as he could feel his body growing, and it was restricting his movements.

His whole body started to grow larger. When looking at his hands, Quinn could see that large dark red scales were running up his arms, his fingers became more claw-like, yet they still kept most of its human shape.

Worst of all, though, Quinn could feel that his face was slightly changing. Something was forming on the top of his head, yet it only affected the top half of his face. The thing was pointing out, and it closely resembled, the skull of a dragon.

His teeth sharpened, growing in size to fit his changed face, yet the bottom half of his face remained what it was. By now, his whole body had finished forming several hard red scales that covered him from head to toe, yet there were two more significant changes.

For one, a sharp large tail started to grow from his lower back and midway, three large spikes could be seen sticking out from it on either side. Lastly, two gigantic wings sprouted from Quinn's upper back. They were mostly black in colour, the top half was solid, while the bottom of the wings looked almost see through. They were red, yet clear like glass, similar to that of the Blood fairy. Finally, his transformation had been completed.

[You have successfully transformed into the 'Crimson Vampiric Dragon Warrior.']

The system didn't need to inform him, he could feel the change that his body had gone through. He could feel various types of aura that were pulsing throughout his body and he was sure, at this point and time, he was the strongest he had ever been.

'A tail…and wings, they feel foreign yet familiar to me. I guess I might look something like a Dalki. All of this is your power Ray?' Quinn asked, but there was no reply.

It was hard to imagine that Ray had given up most of his power leaving only a fraction. Yet with this little energy, his body had drastically changed. While in this state, Quinn checked the system, he was still unable to use his Shadow or summon the others. At the same time, he checked if a certain Quest had been completed.

'It looks like the Quest to become something beyond a vampire isn't complete, which means this is something else… just an influence of Ray.'

The red pulse that came off from Quinn had stopped, and the beasts in the room could finally move again. Yet none of them charged in immediately. They only did so, once they received an order to do exactly that, their bodies started to move.

For some reason, there was an instinct inside Quinn that was taking him over, as all of them came towards him, he had the urge to just shout at the top of his lungs. At that moment, his mouth opened wide as he looked up at the ceiling and let out a roar that wouldn't pale in comparison to a certain Demon tier beast.

——

Standing outside, Nathan was still there with the crystal in his hand, he had no clue what was going on inside, but continued to use his powers, wondering what might have happened by now.

'Was I imagining things? This whole arena should be soundproof, especially with how much Galthrium they used.' Shaking off the sound he had heard, Nathan continued to do his job. However, soon enough, he got confirmation that he hadn't been imagining things. He could see a hand pierce right through the thick Galthrium wall, treating it as nothing more than a minor annoyance, as it started to pull it apart bit by bit.

The first thing he could see was the skull of a dragon and the fierce red pointed eyes.

'What monsters have Pure been creating?' Nathan thought, falling over backwards trying to decide to stay or leave.

———

Chris continued to look down the hallway, until he could see what it looked like. A new beast. It had hard red scales and a skull on top of its head, but it was one that he did not recognise. He wondered if Agent 4 might have forgotten to tell him about it, some secret plan, in case they might need it, or something still in the experimental stage.

At the same time, the beast didn't seem to be responding to the crystal or his actions.

'If that is one of ours, then why isn't it following any of my orders?' Chris was starting to get a very bad feeling. The suspected beast continued to move forward and looked out at all those in the arena. The Pure members, together with the green beasts, were still fighting against the other two groups.

At that moment, Chris received an urgent message on his receiver.

"Agent 1, get out of there! NOW!" The voice on the other side was for Zero, but it was the most panicked he had ever heard his master. "Abort the entire mission!

"But what about all the beasts, and our members?!" Chris questioned. "I'm sure if I joined in the fight, along with you, we could-"

"NO!!!" Zero cut him off. "Forget everything! The entire mission has failed. We made a mistake. I made a very grave mistake… Don't you see that I have completely underestimated how strong that man was?!"

*****

# Chapter 1454 - The Strongest Form
The moment Quinn entered the arena, all of them could feel a power from the south side of the area that was impossible to ignore. From wherever they were it felt like a heavy pressure was pushing down on them, and when they turned all they could see was a strange, large creature.

It was hard to even figure out what it was. Its appearance resembled a Bloodsucker who had been mixed with a Dalki, with a dash of Blood Fairy on top of that. With such a drastic image change, it was safe to say that none of them recognised that creature as Quinn, their King, leader, or friend.

At the moment, the one who had been commanding the vampires so far was trying to figure out what to do.

'This scent is something I've never smelt before. I can't quite pinpoint if it's a beast or a vampire, but its features… Is it another type of beast… or is this Quinn's next stage of evolution?'

In the end, the tenth leader assumed it to be the latter, mainly because it had only killed the new beasts that had appeared, rather than focus on them. At the same time, he could only imagine one person that would be able to stop the onslaught of beasts.

He did not have time to ponder over this matter too long though, since at the same time he noticed something else strange that had occurred, wondering if that might also be Quinn's doing. During their fight, Pure agents had started to come from the north container, where the Board members should have been.

It looked like the beasts were letting them through and soon both groups would have some trouble on their hands, but then suddenly something happened to the Pure beasts. Those that were partially transformed had gone into a full transformation.

Now looking like complete beasts rather than beasts with human features, they had suddenly turned on the Pure members. Using his ears, Vincent was trying to pick up information, so he could get a grip on what was happening.

"What's going on? Everything was working fine up until that beast showed up! Why are they suddenly at- '' The man couldn't finish his sentence, as he had been killed midway. The Pure members were skilled, but the unexpected attack had caught them off guard, and against the onslaught of beasts they stood no chance, even if they were to work together, like the humans and vampires had done.

'This doesn't seem to be part of their plan. What was the case for them going out of control?' Vincent wondered. 'If I think about it, why is there a need to control them in the first place? If they were able to create a beast and human hybrid with the humans they should be in control, as long as they were willing participants like those from Pure, it would be fine.

'But maybe… it's still more beast than human, they still have created some type of imbalance, which is why they need to be controlled.'

In the meantime, another strange thing was happening on the south side. For the first time, Quinn started to walk forward. He wasn't a wild beast, despite his changed appearance, he could still think rationally. He had merely stopped to take in the entire situation, and had come to the same conclusion as Vincent.

' …I bet they just used whoever they could find for their personal gain.' Quinn deduced. 'That's why there are members of Pure that haven't even gone through the process themselves. They deserve to be killed by their own creations.'

The moment Quinn walked forward, each beast was making way for him, even those that were in the midst of fighting. Whether it was consciously or subconsciously he didn't know, but now that they weren't controlled any more, the likeliest scenario was that their natural instincts had taken over.

Yet, there were still plenty that were attacking the others. Looking far, Quinn could see that the Pure members who had come from the north side, looked to already be trying to retreat, running back towards the glass container.

'I won't let you.' Quinn decided, as his wings flapped as fast as a bug, they were as thick and heavy as a drain from the top, so the strength of the wind it was producing was incredible, and the speed looked somewhat unbelievable.

The next second, they saw a red stream graze the sky, and landing directly in the north entrance was the Vampiric Dragon blocking their way.

The Pure agents wanted to turn away, seeing such a thing, but there was an army following them.

"Everything's gone south, since that thing appeared! Let's deal with it, to make everything return to normal!!" A Pure member shouted to motivate his remaining colleagues.

The next second, Quinn turned around, swinging out his large tail. He was still far away from them, but in the next moment it became clear that that wasn't an issue. A single red line in the shape of the tail flew through the sky.

It was larger than any Blood swipe he had ever performed before, and it was far more powerful. The Pure members tried using their Qi to block it, activating their armour skills and some took out some odd crystals, but as soon as the red aura touched their bodies their fate was sealed.

So far it had gone through three rows of beasts and people, slicing them all in half.

"Everyone, leave the area floor, let our King deal with this!" Vincent yelled at the top of his lungs, hoping the others could hear this as well.

Leo of course heard this, and ordered the others to do the same. Most of them were on the stage rather than on the arena's ground floor, but there was one that was still down there. Giving this command to his Familiar who was out on the field, it quickly rushed onto the beast to where the horse was.

"Hey! You heard what they said, take your master to the top of the stage, hurry!" Ovin warned and started to disappear into the mist himself as he went back to Leo.

The horse seemed to understand its call, and soon was running back and jumped onto the stage, while everyone watched what was about to commence.

Those who had been unable to evade the Vampiric Dragon's tail swipe, all had perished. The attack had reached halfway before it had eventually ended.

'That was all from something as simple as a Blood swipe with my tail… just how much power does this form hold? I can tell that I haven't even touched the surface of this power. There are so many things I can do. With this… I might actually be able to get rid of the Dalki!'

Quinn was starting to reconsider whether Ray might have actually been telling the truth when he had claimed that something like the Dragon that had protected the tablet would have been nothing to him. Seeing all of those in front of him, he was ready to finish them all.

He could tell that they were no longer under control, but none of them had reverted to what they once were. Seeing how they were still going after those around them, he was sure that they had either embraced their beast side, or it had simply taken over.

Quinn's wings started to stretch back, almost touching each other, his chest then started to grow as he took in air, and tilted his head back. Red aura energy from within was gathering, and at the same time, blood seemed to be rising from the others around, heading towards Quinn's direction.

It looked like some type of gravity as all the droplets headed towards him. Then, swinging his head back forward with his jaws split wide open, a gigantic beam left Quinn's mouth.

Its range was wide enough to cover the whole arena from where he was, apart from the stands. Everything it touched started to disintegrate.

"This power reminds me of Laxmus… is Quinn now the same as him?" Sunny asked.

"No… this should be different, look." Vincent said.

The red beam had ended, and there wasn't a single beast left. Not only that, but part of the ground had disappeared with them. If one was to look at the south side of the arena… there was no stadium there any more. Looking further, the buildings that used to be there had also completely disappeared off the face of the earth.

"He seems to be even stronger than the Original King."

*****

# Chapter 1455 - A Red Fade
Everyone had been fighting non-stop ever since the pure beasts first appeared, and even though the game didn't tire out their bodies, it still did take a toll on their mental health. To put it simply, nearly all of them were exhausted; just the pressure that their lives and the lives of others behind them were on the line made them feel exhausted. Still, they persisted, and now that the fight seemed over, all of them felt like they could relax.

That was if this new beast, who had just blasted a gigantic hole in the stadium, was on their side. The thing was, after seeing what it was capable of, they all knew deep down that if it wasn't on their side, they had most likely lost this fight anyway.

The vampires were the first to move out on the field. They were tired, but unlike the other side, who were now just sitting on the floor or lying on the ground, exhausted. The leaders went to the partially destroyed area's floor towards the person they thought was their King.

At the same time, many of the leaders felt like this was to show that they had one-upped the other side by showing that they still had the strength to fight more.

Soon, they all stood in front of Quinn, looking up at his new form, but even they were quite scared.

"Vincent, you're sure this is Quinn, right?… I mean, why hasn't he changed back to what he looked like before?" Nicu asked, with his voice a little shaky.

"I'm…sure," Vincent said unconvincingly.

"It's me, don't worry. I'm glad to see that none of you are seriously hurt." Quinn answered. When speaking, his voice was deeper than usual, but there was a slight resemblance to him. Thankfully his jaw remained in a constant shape that was somewhat like a human, so he could speak clearly enough that the others could understand him.

"Pure… I can't believe they did all of this, I knew they were planning something, but I never thought that something like this was possible." Quinn continued. "Their leader was also a member of the Board. It seems both parties have been involved in this matter since the beginning. I just don't understand what their aim is anymore."

Although the others were also thinking the same and were interested in Pure, they were far more interested in Quinn himself, but it felt rude to ask their King and saviour what exactly he was right now, but he certainly didn't look like a vampire.

"Quinn, what happened to you… when you were away, did Pure capture you and experiment on you or something?" Vincent eventually asked what was on everyone's mind.

Just as Quinn was about to answer, the humans who had passed out due to the gas began to wake up slowly. Some had woken up quicker than others, one of them being Sera; in doing so, when he looked out the glass container, he first saw the state of the field.

Since there was nothing on the field itself, it was hard for them all to imagine just what they had slept through. However, there were still countless dead-beast bodies lying on the stage, and it gave them an idea.

When looking around though, Sera's eyes had latched onto a particularly large beast…

"A red dragon…am I seeing things?" Sera said to himself, standing up. He soon drew out his blade and jumped from the stage, dashing past everything. It seemed he used his ability on his boots that allowed him almost to fly until he had reached Quinn's position.

However, before Sera could even draw his blade, nearly all of the leaders had their hands ready to pierce Sera's neck.

"Haha, I guess a fight between me and all of you will be interesting, but I don't care about you lot; I'm here for him. You!" Sera pointed. "What's your relation to the red dragon?"

'Red dragon?' Quinn thought. When thinking about this, he could only think of one Dragon, Ray. He knew his current powers had come from him, and his form was certainly red.

'This is the one with the god powers, correct… Ray, did you know him?' Quinn asked, but there was no answer.

At that moment, red particles started to drift off from Quinn's wings. As the particles left his body, he began to shrink down in size, and even the mask on his face started to disintegrate until it revealed his face.

Eventually, Quinn had reverted to his human form. He could tell his power was gone. There was no system timer, nor did he feel drained. It was as if the energy was just leaving him, going off somewhere else. What he felt a little depressed about was that his ancestor's voice, whom he only recently got used to hearing, seemed to have disappeared as well.

"Oh, it's you," Sera said, taking his hand off his hilt, showing he was no threat. Sera knew that the power he recognized earlier was nowhere to be felt anymore.

"It looks like we all have a lot to discuss." Quinn smiled.

At that moment, there was a large ship flying above them, and it eventually landed in the centre of the arena. Some of them thought it might have Pure's reinforcements, but Quinn wasn't worried; he could sense the people in the ship.

As the ramp went down, there were many familiar faces, and Sam was seen waving out to them all.

"Whoa, looks like we will get quite the story to hear from here." Sam smiled.

——

Currently, both Chris and Zero were on planet earth. They had made their escape and were in a small submarine heading back to the main large submarine that was to be used as Pure's base. Ever since Chris had reunited with Zero, he could see anger on the latter's face which hadn't said a word, and eventually, Chris couldn't hold it in anymore.

"Why did you give up so quickly? We lost a lot of our members back there, and if we were going to run, couldn't we have at least taken them with us?" Chris asked, his tone filled with anger.

"Oh, you're angry, are you?!" Zero snarled, turning around. His forehead wrinkled, scrunching up the marking on his forehead slightly. "Trust me. You aren't anywhere near as annoyed as I am! If we had just completed this task… if we had just gotten rid of them…!"

"Why didn't you join the fight?" Chris asked. "With me, you and the A-Class Hybrids, we could have done something. If we had gotten their powers, then this whole thing would have been over by now!"

"Shut up!" Agent 0 slammed his fist down and looked like he was about to hit Chris himself at any second but stopped himself a little short from doing so.

"You didn't see what I witnessed…that thing didn't look like a vampire or a beast. None of them even wanted to touch him, and he would have wiped us all out, including the A classes, if that was to happen. I thought maybe this was the right time to strike, but that kid's power is too strong. All of our hard work so far would have been ruined, and I still need more myself.

"We will just have to wait, grow our strength once again, and come back so even that kid won't be able to stop us. It was a good thing that we were still able to at least get them out of there, not all is lost, and we can evaluate their strength due to the fight. We can put the data to good use for all of us."

After finishing his words, the marking on top of Zero's head started to light up slightly in a slight golden glow. He touched it for a few seconds and walked out of the room.

"Tell me if anything happens."

As soon as he was far away enough, he opened his mouth to speak.

"I know… I'm sorry I failed my task, but I promise I won't fail again, so please give me another chance." Zero pursed his lips.

*****

# Chapter 1456 - The Aftermath
Despite the grand scale attack that had transpired, it seemed like all of the invitees had come out of the situation alive, be it the unranked, the generals, or the others. Both groups were also thankful for the Cursed faction's arrival because there was still a lot more that needed to be done.

The stadium was still intact and had many empty rooms for them to use. For now, people involved in the incident were taking a rest. In the meantime, Sam, along with the Cursed faction and a few others, were investigating the place.

He and Logan had gone around the experimental facilities to see what was going on and if they could gather any information. Logan learned some things, but it wasn't enough, which was expected because many things were ruined.

Other than that, there were also a few of the pure beasts which had been left alive. Most of them were injured during the fight but not quite killed. After capturing them, they were placed in one of the glass container rooms to learn more about them later.

The problem was, they were still acting like beasts and were trying to attack any human or vampire that they would see on site. After gathering the information, everyone thought they deserved a good night's rest, but before doing so, every group had contracted their respective planets to see if everything was okay.

Thankfully everything was alright, and no news of anything happening here had spread to the outside world, and that included the word about the death of the Board Members.

In the morning, once they woke up, there was going to be a meeting where all of them would gather and share information about what exactly had happened.

Pure had involved them all, and now they had to work together to make sure nothing like this repeated.

While in his own room for the night, Quinn felt a bit down. The lights were switched off, and they had gotten make-shift sleeping bags for him and his group. Everyone from the cursed faction seemed to be sleeping peacefully; some vampires were as well, while others were awake, pacing around the room.

The vampires weren't much of a sleeper in the first place; as for Quinn, he was thinking about something else.

'Please, Ray, if you can hear me… are you there?' Quinn thought to try one more time, but there was no reply just like before.

He thought that perhaps it was due to using his energy, that maybe he would be back in the system once it returned, but it didn't seem to be that way. While checking through his system, Quinn couldn't see any option to turn into what he had done today, but at the same time, the quest to evolve into something beyond a vampire lord was still there.

When Quinn had received the quest, he had done so even before he knew about Ray, so he could only assume this next evolution would be evolving the vampire side of himself. At the same time, the power that Ray had given him had turned him into something else entirely, almost like hybrid beasts which he had seen today.

'I'm sorry for calling you annoying, my ancestor.' Quinn thought. 'Now that I think about it, I didn't even have much time to ask you about your past, family, or anything like that. Maybe I'll never complete that quest.'

The quest in question was to learn more about the Talen family. There were still a few more that perhaps could still give Quinn answers, such as Bliss and the new god he had met Sera. From what he had heard from the others, Sera was beyond strong, and they had also told him about Oscar being quite strong as well.

Quinn was sad for Ray's loss; he was hoping that he would be able to keep that power because he knew it would aid them greatly when facing the Dalki. He hadn't scratched the surface of the form he was in at that time.

'Maybe one day…' Quinn sighed.

The new day soon arrived. Some people from the Cursed faction had already become familiar with Sam and the others as they shared their experiences about yesterday's incident with each other.

It was good because Quinn didn't really want to explain it again and again, and it would give Sam an idea of what the meeting would be like when they all got together. Because right now, Quinn couldn't wrap his head around quite what had happened, so he was hoping by bringing them all together, they would be able to uncover answers.

All of the Cursed faction members walked into the canteen. This was different from the one that the Board had converted into a type of dining hall. This was another one that was actually being used as a canteen with long tables and several seats.

In total, they were using three sets of tables for this meeting. The cursed faction sat on one table on their own while Quinn remained standing. Then at the centre table, there were the vampire leaders on one side and the ones that represented their current groups on the other.

For example, Sach and Samantha, being the two highest-ranking people from the Earth group, sat at this table. Then Abdul and Sera, who had proved themselves, were seated at the table. Grimm, Owen, Mona, and the large figure whose identity, for now, had been asked to remain a secret by those who had seen his face.

Everyone else, such as the generals, Graylash family members, and the Unranked, were seated on the third table.

'They seem to be quiet at least.' Quinn thought as he looked at the centre table and could see that the leaders and humans were shooting daggers at each other with their eyes. It reminded him of when the Cursed faction leaders and the vampires had met each other for the first time.

'If there is one thing this event did, it actually really did introduce the vampires and the humans to each other. Now both sides had come together to fight a similar enemy; maybe this meeting will go smoother than I thought.

'Perhaps, this was the step we needed to go forward, and we can use this as a stepping stone to face the Dalki.'

Of all things, Quinn needed to see something positive from the events that had transpired.

As the meeting started, Quinn first spoke to everyone about what happened while he was away, how he had escaped and what he had seen and been through while roaming through the place. He didn't really explain what that form of his they all saw and just put it down to being one of his many powers.

After that, Sam explained what had happened with them and at the military base, what they had found out with Pure having taken over everything, and the event being a trap since the beginning.

Finally, there were the two reports, from Vincent about the vampires and from Owen and Sach about what happened with the humans.

Everyone got an idea, how each group had played their part in helping them all survive, and those that had been affected by the gas were thankful that they were still alive after hearing what happened.

Some, including Leo, were shocked to learn that Zero was one of the board members and the Board members as they knew were now dead. Questions, for now, would be refrained until everyone explained everything just in case they got their answer during the explanation.

After they discussed what had happened, there was still a lot to talk about, like what to do next, but before even that, they needed to talk about what else they had learned.

"As you know, a lot happened, but there was one person in all of this who seemed to know more about Pure's plans and what they were up to. And there are a lot of questions I want to ask him…for one, how was Pure even able to control the beasts in the first place, and what are these other types of crystal we still don't know about."

It was then a shadow appeared, and Nathan was thrown out from the shadow to the ground on his knees. He stood up and saw all the eyes were on him; some were even surprised. Judging by Quinn's story, they thought he would have perhaps already killed him, but he was very…very much alive.

"Now tell us…what did Pure want," Quinn asked with his eyes glowing red. He was going to get the truth this time, no matter what.

*****

# Chapter 1457 - Three Types Of Crystals
Nathan looked nervous, almost scared of Quinn, and he was right to be after he had seen what the latter had done. After Quinn had torn down the Galthrium wall, Nathan had laid eyes in the room for a brief second and saw everyone in the room had been killed.

"Before that, there is something I would like to bring up first. I thought if we all asked what was on our minds, then you would be able to ask Nathan for the answer." Mona said as she raised her hand politely. She could guess that Quinn was about to use his power based on the red eyes.

"Logan and I have done some investigating into the Hybrid beasts, and we learned a few things," Mona said.

This was an interesting topic to many of them, as everyone wanted to know just how Pure was able to control such a large army.

"The hybrid beasts, as we will refer to them, are hybrids of beasts and humans. However, we found out that among the captured hybrids, all of them have lost the human consciousness, or in simple words, the human mind. They are just like beasts until I use my ability to control them.

"Just like with regular beasts, my power works on them as well, and I can control them. I heard about what members of Pure were doing. They were capturing members of my family and also capturing beasts doing some sort of experiment. I'm sure that we can all come to the same conclusion when I say this… how have they learned to use the Bree family's power? I doubt someone from my family taught it to someone else, even if that was the case. Controlling a large number of beasts is something that even I can't do."

When Mona had brought it up, this was something Quinn hadn't even thought of too much. He thought that perhaps they had found a way to use the Bree family's power, but if Mona was saying she couldn't control this many, how could they do such a thing?

All eyes were on Nathan, and Quinn also turned towards him.

"No! Quinn, I will tell the truth this time. I will answer willingly, so don't worry." Nathan said. "If you want, later you can just use your skill to ask whether I told the truth or not."

He had a point, and Quinn agreed; otherwise, he would constantly ask several questions with the influence skill.

"Answer Mona's questions and explain about the crystal you have," Quinn asked, in a tone that was unlike how he would speak to Nathan before, and no one could blame Quinn for acting this way. He was being direct with a person who was practically a traitor; Yes, Quinn could understand why Nathan had done such a thing, but in doing so, Nathan had put the lives of everyone here today at risk, and Quinn could have lost them all.

"First…" Nathan was a little nervous. He was an adult, someone who used to be respected, but he had never quite been put in the situation he was in today with all these powerful figures scrutinising him in disgust. "The Crystal I have in my hand is an enhancement crystal. As you know, more than any of the other groups, the Earthborn group has been focusing on the mining of the beast planets we own or used to own.

"Instead of fighting beasts to gather their crystals, the military was trying to find a safer way. I'm sure the generals and Sach will know that we would send new finds back to the lab to analyse every time a new crystal was found. Especially after what had happened with another set of crystals found."

"He's talking about a set of active crystals," Sach said. "It was a disaster for the military back then. Such Crystals reacted as soon as we touched them with our bare hands, similar to activating gear. It caused them to explode, and a lot of lives were lost. Because of this, new crystals that were found would be handed to the military for analysis before moving forward.

"In the first place, not many could figure out how to use a new crystal."

Nathan nodded, showing that the information he said was true.

"The thing was…as you now know, Pure had been a member of the Board for a long time. I can't pinpoint when exactly, but it seems to be shortly after the first war that Zero had taken over Mr Watson's place. I'm not even sure the other members of his family knew.

"Zero, their leader, had all of this information available to him, and it was easy for him to obtain these crystals. At the same time, it was effortless for them to cover up any discoveries related to these things. I just want to say that I am not a member of Pure, so some of my knowledge may have a few hiccups, but it seems that Pure have their own research team. At the same time, they would use certain tactics to use the military's research team and work together without the latter knowing that they were helping the enemy.

"In these labs, they discovered many things, even new materials such as the glass-like containers you were stuck in. Anyway, there were three types of crystals found in total; one is the enhancement crystal. This is the round crystal I have in my hand at the moment. Like beast crystals, they too have different tiers, but it's harder to tell unless you are holding one.

"This Crystal allows you to enhance your ability power; it gives a boost in MC cells as long as you are still holding the Crystal. Then there are the Upgrade crystals; depending on their tier, they can upgrade beast gear to the next step. There are a lot of crystals, probably more than I mentioned, that have been found, but I have no clue about them.

"As I said, I was only invited to help out at the Pure's base a couple of times, so I don't know everything, but because I was involved in a few of their plans, they did tell me a few things. What they have is something called a storage crystal. It's a clear crystal that looks like complete glass with nothing inside, but with it, they can extract abilities and place them inside. I didn't know that they were capturing members of the Bree family, but if that's the case, then I imagine that somehow they were able to get your family's ability and store it in the Crystal…this is the most probable guess."

Hearing Nathan's words brought up a faint memory for Quinn.

The Crystal was similar to what Bryce had. He was using a crystal to store the power of the shadow but did this mean that they could store multiple powers? Otherwise, it wouldn't make any sense.

It seemed like Mona had come to the same conclusion. Veins popped up on her forehead out of anger. She could only imagine how many members of the Bree family were killed or their powers were taken away from them, all so that the Pure could control the Hybrid beasts.

"Wait, are you saying they can take any of our abilities away?" Samantha asked. "Is that what they were trying to do today? And they can even use them…?"

Nathan shook his head as he didn't have an answer.

"Originally Pure were after Truedream," Sam said with his finger on his chin. "I guess now that they have found these crystals, there is no longer a need for him because they can do the same thing without him.

"If they still had these crystals and powers now, they don't have to worry about their experiments getting out of hand and becoming too beast-like; they just want to create the strongest Hybrids possible."

There was a bit of silence in the room as the generals and others were taking in the information. They felt betrayed by those they worked for and trusted.

"These crystals." Muka was the first to speak from the vampire side. "We actually already knew of them; we have a few as well."

All heads, including Quinn's turned to the vampire, for even Quinn didn't know about this.

# Chapter 1458 - A Red Question
It was strange to find out this information about vampires knowing these crystals because it was something even Quinn was unaware of. He was sure that if the vampires had such crystals, then when he had first obtained the upgrade crystal, Vincent would have known about it.

"Don't look at me," Vincent said, shrugging his shoulders as if he could read Quinn's mind. "There was a period in my life where I know no details of what happened."

"Can you elaborate a little?" Quinn asked, smiling towards Muka.

"You have to remember that a lot of vampires pride themselves on their natural strength, and only the tenth family was interested in things like using the beast crystals for combat. In contrast, we focused on their use more so in everyday life as an energy source.

"When the tenth leader disappeared, there weren't many vampires who were interested in beast crystals anymore; in fact, it's safe to say that there were none. Still, during our expeditions, we did come across different crystals. The round one that is in his hand, I have seen it before…about the others, I can't say if we have or not because I do not know what they look like.

"But sometimes, we came across crystals that don't exactly match up to the regular beast crystals you know of today."

Quinn thanked Muka for explaining. He would need to look into that when they got back. Thankfully they had transported everything in the vampire settlement with them. The only thing he was wondering about was whether these crystals were abundant in the vampire solar system or not.

If they were, then there would be another tool that they could use to help them in the war against the Dalki. At the moment, Quinn had some fourth family members out exploring the beast planets, searching for a nest crystal. It would be a boost if he could instruct them to look for these other crystals.

For the next few minutes, Mona asked Nathan a few more questions, mainly to do with the Bree family, but he didn't seem to know much about the exact situation. Just to make sure the latter was being honest, Quinn had used his influence skill this time, and it seemed like he had been telling the truth all along.

"Is there any more information that we can try asking from Nathan before we move on to other things?" Quinn asked.

At that moment, Sach raised his hand.

"Pure… how were they able to get you to help them out. We heard from Sam about the base they took over. What is the current situation with all of the members of the Board and what is going to happen now…how was Pure able to do all of this?"

Nathan gulped before answering this question; the question alone made him recall some scenes in his head.

"I was one of the lucky ones." Nathan finally replied. "When Sam ordered me to help out the Earthborn group, Sach, you sent me to Earth for a task. At the time, everything was going well, and every one of the Earthborn forces was focused on fighting the Dalki.

"From what I gathered, it was a single attack orchestrated by Pure. They had hit each of the cities and the military bases, all at the same time. Our forces were weak, they were powerful, but the final nail on the coffin was the Pure members who were part of the group.

"At the moment, every force on Earth…is pretty much under their control. Family members are being used as hostages, leaving those like me with no choice but to act and do their bidding. I am afraid that they have the whole world as a hostage, including the BBoard's power."

They all knew that this wasn't good news at all and was the worst outcome they could expect. For one, the Board were families that the military and other groups relied on; this was the main reason why the former could blackmail them into this event in the first place.

After what had happened and with things not going their way, it was possible that unless the people here were willing to fight their own and go to war, Earth now belonged to Pure.

"If we have time, resources won't be too much of an issue," Quinn said. "There are ways for us to get the things we need to help fight."

When saying this, Quinn was thinking about using the vampire resources and the beast planets in their solar system.

"Still, this pressure that we could be attacked from our back at any time is not a good one… we need to get Earth back by any means, while not moving our forces which are fighting against the Dalki. If we make one movement, the latter will notice this, and it won't be long before we get into something even more troublesome. "

It was then that an unexpected person had raised their hand, one that had been silent for almost the entire time. It was the unranked Sera, sitting at the table.

"Let me take care of Pure," Sera said. "I wasn't involved in this war with the Dalki anyway, but I'll make sure that all of these Pure members no longer exist."

"What is in it for you?" Samantha asked. "What do you want in return?"

Samantha refused to believe that someone who hadn't joined the fight so far was just willing to help out.

"Because they have made this personal," Sera said. "They tried to take my life… I don't take too kindly to those who take my life. So no, I'm not doing it for you; I'm doing this for myself. You guys can just pick up the scraps that are left."

"I would also like to go along with him," Leo spoke up. "I, as a member of the Cursed faction, can help out greatly in many ways, and I can also sense Qi, which means I can pick out the Pure members more effortlessly."

This was true, but Quinn could imagine the real reason why Leo wanted to go. To find out his master and what exactly they had planned to do. The only worry was that Quinn could no longer summon Leo with his skill if he needed him or his help.

'I'm still thinking like this, huh…if there is someone I can't defeat now, Leo wouldn't be much help either. I should let him do his own thing, and it would be good to have someone on the inside.'

"Please…let me go as well." Nathan suddenly said. "My family, and the others they have hostage, I might also recognize a few of them."

He knew it was a long shot, but he thought Quinn could probably help as well.

"I have a suggestion," Sam said. "I think he should be allowed to go, and Sera and Leo should lead the vampire soldiers. Other than us in this room, we don't know who is with Pure and who is not, nor do we know who could switch sides at any point and time.

"However, the vampire soldiers are different, and I'm sure they have a great interest in making sure that earth is safe along with the rest of them as well."

Sera didn't seem to have any problem with their suggestion, but he did have one condition.

"I'm okay with all of this; I don't mind you guys keeping an eye on me but let me say one thing, If we are ever in trouble, a serious situation that I think is dangerous, let me take command. Follow my orders down to the last line, and I promise that we will get out of it alive."

Due to Sera's power and how much they actually needed his help, there was no problem with Sam and Leo agreeing to their requirements. Of course, Nathan could go along, but he would be kept under the mindful watch of Leo.

"If you are worried about humans so much, there is something you could do." Katori interrupted them all. "Why don't you just turn him into one of us? He would follow the orders of the Turner, and he would lose his power to stop your abilities. I think that would be the safest thing to do."

This remark reminded all the humans in the room what the vampires really were and the most frightening thing about them. Some of them wanted to object when hearing this, but the thing was…they weren't trusting Nathan either.

"I will leave that choice up to Leo or the vampire soldiers to do," Quinn said. "Thank you for the suggestion, though. Right now, we still don't know what Pure's aim is. If they already had so much control over the board members, why did they want to get rid of us so badly? It's almost as if they wanted us to lose this war.

"So, try your best to find out about Pure, and as for the rest of us. We will take care of the Dalki." Quinn stated.

The meeting looked like it was coming to an end with a lot learned and everyone informing what they planned to do now; that's when the room was opened up to more questions, and a shy lady raised her hand slowly.

"I just wanted to ask…who is the tenth leader?" Samantha said with her face red.

*****

# Chapter 1459 - A Fight With A Special Prize
At first, people thought it was a strange question for Samantha to ask in a meeting like this. Why would one of those from the Earthborn group care about the vampire leaders? But there was another lady in the room who managed to figure it out quicker than the others and couldn't help but laugh.

"The tenth leader? Why would she want to know about the tenth leader?" Fex asked out loud, a little annoyed. Samantha stood up though, and started looking towards the other table. Eventually, everyone was starting to remember the match they had. Samantha had gone up against the tenth leader in her fight… and who could forget the ending of their match.

"I'm the leader of the tenth family," Vincent admitted as he stood up.

Samantha looked at him up and down. Vincent was wearing the same clothing as her opponent had, the mask still covering his face. Since it was also covering his mouth, it was hard to tell what he fully looked like, but he certainly did look like the character from the game.

"I wanted to ask… why did you say that… you liked me?" She struggled to finish her words.

Some people in the room were starting to get second-hand embarrassment and couldn't help but turn away.

'What a brave girl, but did she really have to do this right here, in front of everyone?' Mona wondered.

"Well, of course, it's because you are a beautiful woman. You are strong, have nice curves, and your-!" Vincent answered confidently, but suddenly a loud yell interrupted him.

"Noooo!" Fex was the one who had yelled. "What the hell are you saying?!"

Turning her head towards the source of the shout, Samantha could tell who it was, the first vampire she had ever met, but why was he yelling like that?

'What do I do… Vincent's ruining my image, and what if she starts to like him now, thinking he was the one who confessed…but do I come out here in front of anyone? Will that be a big deal?' While he was panicking, a friend had come by his side.

"You know… after Helen died, and I saw the video message she left, I realised something. You never know what might happen, and you could lose your chance to tell someone how you truly feel… so honestly, you should just go for it and tell her what you want." Quinn whispered to him. "Besides, I seem to recall you telling me that you would only take my love advice if I became King. However, if you're too scared, feel free to consider this an order."

The words from a King, his friend, had encouraged Fex, and he stood up from his seat.

"No, Samantha… the one that fought against you in that match…yes, it was the tenth leader, but the truth was I was the one that fought you. I was pretending to be the tenth leader at the time." Fex confessed. Part of him wanted to look away out of embarrassment, but since he had decided to say as much, he looked straight into her eyes.

"What is going on right now?" Sunny whispered to Jin next to her. "I feel like I'm watching some drama or something."

Samantha had her hand covering her mouth as the truth had unfolded.

"You… so you were the one… who told me that… you think you are in love with me?" The young woman asked for clarification, to which Fex just nodded.

Soon, cheering from the generals and others was heard.

"Answer the brave boy!"

"He's a vampire though, can a vampire and a human have a relationship?"

"You're still thinking that way? You're behind the times."

"What do you mean behind the times? This is happening too soon."

"I think… maybe?" Samantha didn't know what to say, as she had paused. Before she could say anything else, though, the people heard a loud bang. Then a giant figure stood up, a large imprint of his fist embedded on the table in front of him.

Those who had seen what the figure had done on the field, none of them wanted to get in its way, and they could see that it was slowly making its way towards Fex.

'Oh, I guess Oscar will have the last say in all of this after all.' Owen chuckled under his fan.

The Royal Knight walked up, and the two figures stood opposite each other. Fex had learned who was under the suit of armour, and since he had practically asked his daughter to go out with her, it seemed only right that he faced her father.

"Erhhh, don't you want to speak?" Fex asked.

Quinn summoned a pen and a piece of paper from the shadow, handing it over to Oscar. In turn, he received the precious box to hold on to. It looked like it was hard for Oscar to let it go, as he gripped it tightly.

"I'll look after it," Quinn promised, and it was then Oscar's fingertips had allowed him to. With both hands free, Oscar wrote something on the notepad and turned it around, shoving it in Fex's face.

"If you want my… the woman, then you have to prove that you can protect her." Fex read the writing out loud. With a scratched out word next to the word woman. "You won that game using the body of another. So now prove that you are strong enough to protect her on your own by… You want me to fight and defeat you?!"

Some of them nearly chickened when they heard this, and even the vampire leaders felt sorry for Fex. The mythical beast, the Dullahan, was more impressive than any of them, and they were sure that it would be nearly impossible for Fex to beat him.

"I…I…" Fex was mulling, but he needed to make a decision. "I accept. You're right. I need to prove that I can look after her."

Both sides were interested as it looked like they were about to witness another fight.

"Wait!" Samantha shouted, jumping in between the two of them, and she kicked both of the men by on their shin.

"What do you two idiots think you're doing? Don't I get a say in any of this? I don't need some stranger making up rules for me! I can decide for myself." Samantha argued. "I can like who I want, and I can choose who I want to be with, besides…" Samantha turned towards Fex. "You already risked your life to protect me once before, so… I guess I wouldn't mind giving it a shot…"

The others could see a smile on her face, hidden behind her red cheeks, and those on the sidelines started to whistle and cheer once again. Whether this was the beginning of a romance between a human and a vampire, only time would tell, but the meeting had come to an end.

While final points were getting sorted about what each person was to do, the groups were getting ready. For one, the hybrid beasts needed to be handed to one of them, and they needed to discuss when and how to update each other on their situations.

This was left to Sam, and in the meantime, Quinn headed over to speak to a certain person. He had gone to the canteen tables where all Unranked were seated and approached a certain person.

"You're Sera, is that correct?" Quinn asked.

"Oh, the leader of the Cursed faction and the King of the vampires has come to greet me," Sera said. "It seems the one I fought in the game wasn't you. The two of you don't feel the same. It looks like it will be another time when we get to spar with each other. To what do I owe the pleasure to meet such a great one as yourself?"

Quinn looked around and could see that the others were each having their own conversation. He wasn't sure that the topic he wanted to talk about was something others should be listening in on, so he decided to give him a hint.

"I wanted to talk to you about some 'people' you might know. It's come to my knowledge that you might be the same as them." Quinn answered. "Do you happen to know a woman by the name of Bliss?"

Hearing this name caused Sera to raise an eyebrow. It was a clear sign that he knew who she was.

"And… do you know someone called Ray?" Quinn asked. "Ray Talen?"

This name caused Sera to get up from his seat.

"I thought there was something special about you. Why don't the two of us chat while taking a walk?"
