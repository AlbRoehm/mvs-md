# Chapter 1510 - A Great Cost
Ever since One Horn grew in size, the group was constantly thinking of a way to kill him. His large size wasn't just for show. He had gained great strength, and on top of that, whatever attacks they made on him, it was no different than a mosquito bite to him.

In the end, they all had to put their trust in the Dullahan, Oscar, who had claimed he, or at least his familiar, had a way. It seemed crazy, but what other choice did they have?

Now seeing what trick Oscar had up his sleeve, they looked at the giant skeleton warrior and couldn't help but have a sliver of hope that this was enough to deal with One Horn just because both were similar in size.

"Hold him steady!" Mona shouted as she jumped off the back of One Horn. She had used her spears and the string to tangle the wings as much as possible, but they still needed to be somewhat held on with her hands, and it wasn't something she was confident in doing.

Luckily, the knots and tangling of the string did most of her work, and she was just relieved the string was somewhat holding out.

"We need to let that giant Skeleton deal with him! Only with him can we win this!" Mona cried again.

As the effect of the green smoke wore off, One Horn noticed the Giant Soldier in front of him and began to come to his senses. He tried to move his legs, but Linda and Samantha put all their strength to hold him down.

They dug their fingers hard into the scales, pulling downward as much as they could. If they were to break off their concentration for an instant, they would take off along with One Horn's legs.

The giant soldier moved its sword in front of him. He then took a stance and started running across the shelter floor the next second. The Skeleton was very heavy, as with each step, the ground shook and crushed whatever was beneath its feet.

It charged forward and thrust the sword right at One Horn's chest, but there was one thing that One Horn could still move quite well and hadn't been tied up, and that was his hands. At the right time, One Horn slammed them both making a fist punching the sword from both sides.

But the momentum of the Skeleton prevailed, and the sword continued to push forward, piercing the Dalki's chest. A great amount of green blood was sprayed out, gushed on the surface for the first time.

However, One Horn smiled as the sword came to a standstill and no longer went further in his chest.

"I think maybe you all forgot something!" One Horn shouted. His voice so loud their ears boomed, "Even in this form, the more blood I lose..., the stronger I GET!"

One Horn pushed the sword out of his chest still with his hands. And just when he was about to make a counterattack, he suddenly felt something strange on his leg - they were stuck in the ground, and he couldn't move them.

With the string and the two Girls, he could barely move.

"GET OFF ME!" One Horn screamed, trying to force his leg upward.

The thick strings looked like they were at their max tension, and a few of them began to snap.

"My…string," Fex said, collapsing on the ground. He had used his ability far too much and was exhausted from running around the enemy.

At the same time, the Skeleton soldier took another swing, and the Dalki threw out its fist. It moved its legs slightly to try and give more power into its punches, but the two on the ground continued to hold on tight. Their fingertips were bleeding as they rubbed against the hard scales.

"Keep holding on!" Linda shouted.

The sword clashed against the Dalki's knuckles, cutting the skin slightly, but couldn't reach the bone before One Horn flung it away again.

'We need to get a clean strike somehow.' Mona thought, looking up.

It was at the moment, though, that for a split second, Samantha's fingers had lost grip. Now, moving his leg somewhat more comfortably, more string broke off as One Horn raised his leg.

"NO!" Samantha shouted. She jumped up, grabbed the leg again, and attempted to pull it down.

"Get off my leg!" One Horn shouted. And he immediately stomped onto the ground, shaking the whole area and causing Samantha to lose balance and fall on her back. One Horn realised that he would need full momentum to defeat this Skeleton.

Intending to get rid of one of the ones causing him trouble, he lifted his leg and slammed it down on Samantha's body. She lifted her arms and pushed back the foot. She could see the scales, but for some reason, the strength didn't seem to be as much as she had expected.

"GET OUT OF HERE!" Sach shouted.

He was now under the foot. Blood Hardening was covering his arms as blood dripped out of his mouth. His eyes were almost bloodshot red. His bones and his strength were the only things holding up the body. Such a small figure was doing so much.

"I don't understand how I'm able to do this either. Maybe it's similar to one of those situations where the mother lifts a car to save her baby! Anyway, get out of here; that's a direct order from your Supreme Commander!" Sach shouted.

Samantha didn't want to move, but then she thought that perhaps she could push One Horn's leg from the side if she got out. She quickly rolled her body to the side and stood up, getting ready to push the leg.

However, when she saw Sach, she noticed a smile on his face. With her now safe, all his willpower slowly disappeared. Holding up the leg of One Horn for that long was already a miracle in itself. Even with his ability and vampire body, the pressure crushed his bones, and eventually, the foot had flattened on the ground, crushing Sach.

"NOOO!" Samantha shouted as she willed up all the strength in her fist and punched One Horn's leg as hard as she could. It caused it to twitch back slightly, and One Horn looked down as he felt the unexpected impact.

'How strong is she?' One Horn thought he needed to get rid of her first, but in that split hesitation of thought, the Skeleton had charged forward-looking to produce the same attack once again.

The sword was already close to him and was about to pierce his chest and then right through his heart. A moment of distraction was going to lead to his downfall, and there was no way to stop it.

"If I'm dying here today…then I'm taking you with me!" One Horn shouted as he moved forward with all his strength, breaking all the string and pushing away Linda.

He had run right through the sword, allowing it to pierce through his chest and heart but not before using his own hand aimed straight through the skeleton's chest, and he punched right through it. The bones shattered instantly, and a small figure was chucked out of the back, flying through the Shelter.

The whole Skelton began to crumble and fall to the ground, and the others felt as if their hope of defeating One Horn was gone at that moment. However, One Horn's body began to sway a few seconds later.

The rest of the group moved out of the way as he fell on his back, crashing down in his gigantic size. He took his last few breaths until, eventually, he was no longer breathing.

"Is it…over?" Fex broke the silence.

"I think it is.." Mona said. "The question is…at what cost.."

The Shelter around them had been destroyed; not a single person from it seemed to be alive. Samantha rushed over to Sach as she wanted to see his state...or whatever was left of him as tears streamed down her face.

"We...lost Sach." Fex eventually said in dismay. The two hadn't known each other for long or had spent a lot of time together, but fighting side by side with someone as brave and strong as him, Fex hated to lose to Sach. But now... the latter had gone ahead.

"I don't think that's the only one," Mona said, looking off in the distance where Oscar's body had landed.

*****

# Chapter 1511 - A Loss Or A Win?
The others stepped towards the large crater caused by One Horn's foot. There were many craters in the Shelter, but this one, in particular, was larger than the others showing how much strength had been used in the attack.

They hoped to give Sach the respect he deserved by proper burial, especially since he sacrificed himself and was the Supreme Commander. It was something that others around the world would like to see.

Unlike the others who had been absorbed by the Dullahan, there should have been something left, but when they reached the crater, they were stumped by the scene in front of them.

None of them could recognise Sach. A red splat on the floor with the organs and bones completely flattened was in the centre, and there was nothing left of him. Witnessing this made them all realise the reality of what they had been through.

Samantha was still on her knees sobbing. She still couldn't believe that Sach would sacrifice his life for her.

"Why..why…me." Samantha started to cry.

"We can't do anything about this one, but we should at least check if the other one is alive," Mona conveyed as she was already heading to where Oscar was. On the other hand, Linda had decided to stay by Samantha's side.

While Fex headed off with Mona, he wanted to stay with Samantha, give her words of comfort, but he didn't know what to say at this moment, and he himself was distressed as well. He felt like perhaps Linda would be the adequate one to comfort Samantha.

Eventually, Mona and Fex came across the Dullahan. His body had crashed into a large pile of rubble. What was once a building was now just rubble with the Dullahan laying on top of it.

"Is he alive?" Fex asked. There was never a heartbeat with Oscar in the first place since he was an undead creature, so it was hard for Fex to tell just by looking at the body. The armour on him was destroyed, and his body seemed quite crushed.

Not in the same way as Sach, but it was hard to believe that the Dullahan would be able to walk again. Fex eventually saw a round object not too far, looking around the area. Running towards it, he picked it up off the ground.

It was Oscar's head, but it no longer looked like what it once did, with half of it being crushed from its head and one of its eye sockets. The only thing that was still intact was the creepy smile. He walked back with the head in his hand, returning to Mona.

"I think.. he's…dead as well." Fex eventually said. "We lost a lot...the humans lost the supreme commander, and now, someone who was strong enough to take out One Horn is gone as well. While we were…."

"We were enough," Mona answered. "All of us took part in defeating One Horn, and if he had continued to live…just look at this Shelter, it's thoroughly destroyed. One Horn would have gone Planet to Planet destroying the Shelters with ease. Perhaps even halting the human race's progress compared to what it is now.

"And…" Mona clenched her fist in anger. "Maybe it's better that he's gone."

"What do you mean by that?!" They heard a shout from behind.

Turning around, the two could see that Samantha and Linda had caught up to them. The former's eyes were glued to the head that Fex was holding. She stomped over, and he immediately handed it over as she snatched it from his hands.

Samantha fell to her knees again, holding the head and bringing it into her chest as even more tears rolled over her cheek. She had already cried a lot when she had lost her father once, and now she was going through the same thing again.

But soon, the tears of sadness were turning to anger.

Raising her head, she stared towards Mona, who had said the earlier words.

"What do you mean by that? What do you mean it's better that he died?! Don't forget that it was because of him that we defeated One Horn!"

Fex was wondering what to do. The one thing they didn't want now of all times was infighting, but he also couldn't comprehend the reasoning behind Mona's words.

"For one, we all took part in taking One Horn down. I doubt if any one of us weren't here today, then he would have easily slaughtered the rest! And I don't want to say it, but can't you see what he did?! Oscar came this way, and it was because of him everyone at the Shelter died, including my people, whom I had brought here.

"If you haven't figured it out, Oscar uses the dead's bodies to utilise his powers. I understand that it was to take down One Horn, but that doesn't justify what he has done. Nor does it help me quell my anger and feel sad for the ones I have lost!"

Honestly, Samantha hadn't actually thought about what Oscar had done a lot. She thought he had just run in this direction, but now looking around, she could see that there were no bodies at all. Where did all the fifty thousand corpses in the Shelter disappear to?

"I'm sorry, but that man wasn't completely your father. I have spent more time with the new Oscar, at least more than you. Yes, a part of him was still in there, but most of him was a monster created by Richard Eno to help us win this war."

It took some time for the rest to get a hold of the situation, and it was worse than they had thought. Sach, the supreme commander, was dead, the strongest force out of the Earthborn group was annihilated, and Oscar was no longer, so what were they supposed to do now?

"Without the Supreme commander, how will the Earthborn group function?" Samantha asked.

"Now you are thinking a bit more with your head straight," Mona nodded. "With Sach gone, someone has to take over his role. This war is important. It's still hard to judge whether this is a victory or a loss for us, but we must continue with the plan, and someone has to lead them.

"Samantha, Oscar, and Sach, the past two Supreme commanders, risked their life for you. They both deemed you as someone more important than themselves. You need to take up the role. Report to Sam everything that has happened, plan, and lead the Earthborn group further. We need to win this war... we have already lost too much."

Samantha thought about Mona's words. She wasn't as strong as Mona, she had kept suffering loss after loss, but she wasn't the only one. Everyone would suffer more losses if this war were to continue.

"You... you don't have to do this alone," Fex said, kneeling beside her and offering his hand. "I'll be there to help you... Even though I'm not like Sach or your father, I will stand beside you."

Nodding to this, Samantha finally stood up and looked around at the entire Shelter.

It was time for them to make their report.

Before leaving, Fex turned his head at the large Dalki corpse of One Horn. His body was still lying in the Shelter, and it hadn't shrunken down in size at all. Linda, who appeared next to him, was also staring at it. At the same time, Mona and Samantha were making the report.

"It's scary, right?" Linda said. "All the five spike beings are this strong. Slicer...One Horn... and there's still another one. It just makes me wonder if One Horn was this strong and wasn't the leader... then how much stronger is Graham?"

"We don't know if Grahm is stronger than One Horn, and sometimes the leader isn't always the strongest," Fex replied. "Also, I think having a large body here in front of us, filled with the blood of a five spike Dalki, might benefit us all a lot."

While staring at the corpse, an idea had flashed in his mind.

*****

# Chapter 1512 - A White Flag
A little while ago, Sam had received news of the loss that the Earthborn group had suffered. Honestly, he hated to say it, but even the loss of Sach and Oscar was within his predictions. If he was being more honest, he thought there was a good chance that the Earthborn group would fail, and all of them would be lost.

If they were really struggling, and if the situation looked completely hopeless, Sam had instructed Linda to contact him. In that scenario, she would contact Quinn, and the latter would be the one to deal with One Horn. Thankfully it seemed like it was not needed. However, one thing he didn't expect was Samantha's willingness to accept the situation.

With her help, if the Earthborn group listened to them during these times, it would be much better, and hopefully, there would be fewer issues.

'I hate that I think this way.' Sam thought while sitting down in one of the combat ships. They were currently heading to their next destination. Thanks to certain groups in the Cursed faction army, they had successfully taken back eight of the nine planets that the Cursed faction once owned.

He and his group would be heading out to the first planet where the Dalki had gathered. Now, this was where the real battle would start, as they moved onto the planets that the Dalki owned, Sam had informed the other groups where the Dalki were located since many of the beast planets in the Dalki's side of the solar system, as it was called, were empty.

The groups knew where they needed to go, but Sam wondered how to use the advantage they had right now. For one, Fex and the others were quite far from where they were.

In the end, Sam had told him to ignore the other groups and come straight to the Dalki-occupied beast planet of the solar system. He imagined that 'help' that he had suggested would be best used there.

'Just one more planet for them to take over, and they will be moving out as well.' Sam thought, looking at the list.

The plan was proceeding quicker than Sam had imagined. The only reason he was entering the Dalki-occupied part of the solar system, which was left untouched since the treaty, was because the Blade group successfully dealt with the Dalki fortresses quicker than expected.

They were currently taking on the ninth and last planet that used to be owned by the Cursed faction.

———

The Blade family were currently on a planet named Erty. It was a planet that mostly had water with one big continent. This made it easy for the Blade group to find the fortress they were looking for.

Upon landing, they could feel the humidity in the air, and getting off the ship a distance away, the Blade family were ready to move.

"Is everyone ready!" Vorden called out to the people behind him. He was leading the army for now, and they were only groups with no vampire leaders by their side. It was just a small army compared to others.

Honestly, they had hardly lost anyone as well because there wasn't much work for the other ability users to do with Sil and the rest. The two now Demon tier beasts were unstoppable forces. Sil had a large pool of abilities to choose from since he had an army of ability users behind them.

Then there was Borden, who had more spikes than most of the Dalki in the enemy fortress. The others would just stay back for support, and most deal with stray Dalki who tried to escape.

The group began to march off, bringing along some of their equipment, trailers, vehicles, and more that would transport a large number of the group. Currently, the Blade family were riding ahead, leading the charge on a large four-wheeled vehicle.

The land was a bit rough and bumpy as the surface wasn't exactly the smoothest. Still, all of them looked off into the distance carefully with Raten behind the wheel. Although a demon tier beast, he could transform himself, and he was getting better and better at controlling his mud powers.

He essentially looked identical to a human while controlling things. That was when up ahead they could see something.

"Is that a Dalki?" Borden asked.

"It is, and it looks like it's holding up a white flag. Are they trying to surrender?" Vorden thought. For years, a white flag has been a sign of peace and surrender, but this has never happened when fighting against the Dalki.

"What do you want to do?" Sil asked as he was getting his hands ready to deal with the Dalki in front of them.

"It could be a trap, but at the same time, if we can solve this without fighting, then it will save more lives. It would be best if we talk to them." Vorden replied as he stood up and placed his hand out, gesturing to the rest of those behind them to stop advancing.

In the meantime, the vehicle continued forward, and when they were close to the Dalki, they all got off. Borden was still in his little form, and he would only take injections when needed, so he mostly stayed on top of Vorden's shoulder since that was his favourite brother of the lot.

The group looked around to see if they could see any Dalki. They could see the tip of the fortress in the distance, but it was too far away for them to come running towards them suddenly.

In the end, Vorden was the one who took the lead. Using his new black wings, he flew up and landed directly in front of the Dalki, who had no less than three spikes. However, in front of a beast-like Vorden, the two figures looked equally frightened. Their heads matched in heights, and a human seeing this wouldn't want to run into either of them.

"What's with the white flag?" Vorden asked.

The others didn't get too close, worried that they might make the Dalki feel anxious.

"We wish to surrender. We know what has been happening, and you have taken over every fortress so far. We don't wish to fight, but we just want to survive." The Dalki responded.

It was strange. Vorden didn't understand why now of all times.

"This is not based on our leader's orders but on us as a fortress. I can see you are confused, but we feel the other Dalki have abandoned us. We have received no help, and communication has completely been cut off from the main base. Please..we Dalki just wish to live."

There were concerns with whether they were telling the truth or not. For instance, the Dalki had a nature similar to beasts to kill those who weren't of the same kind. This nature even caused them to fight amongst each other for power.

At the same time, if they were to leave the Dalki, then what if the latter changed their mind and attacked them from behind. There was one more thing as well.

"You...you killed a lot of people in the shelter that was originally here. Some people want you all dead. You have to...you have to give me a reason to stop them. Your desire to live means nothing to them," Vorden stated. "First, tell me, why would the Dalki even abandon you?"

The three spike Dalki looked back for a second at the fortress behind him before turning around to the others.

"We have a short life span, and there is only one Dalki at the moment with a mind great enough to make it so we can live for a long time, like beasts which live on for thousands of years. However, our lives have been tossed to the side. With what little time we have left..we do not wish to waste it over meaningless conflict.

"You seem to know about us…you should know that there is a human side to us as well. The human side wishes just to live, and we know fighting against you would be a waste. If you really want, though, we will fight for our lives.

"As for your other questions..the reason why Graham has given up on us...is because he has already created something better than us..and he calls them the new Gen Dalki. If you continue onward to our part of the solar system, you will come across them..there is no longer a place in this world for us." The Dalki said.

------

At the same time, far away from here, Sam and the others had landed on the first Dalki planet that had condensed forces. Logan looked at the readings and could see the number of enemies was very high.

"We're close… we're close to the finale of this war." Sam smiled.

*****

# Chapter 1513 - The Worst Outcome
A little while before Sam and his group had landed, they were carefully checking the planets nearby. Using Logan's devices that had been adjusted to track the readings of the Dalki instead of the demon tier beast showed that there really were no Dalki on the other planets.

Surprisingly as well, they were still working and hadn't been destroyed, including the ones on the planets with Dalki.

'Condensing their forces, are they really just using the same trick as us when we first attacked?' Sam thought. 'It doesn't seem to quite suit what they have done before.'

It was then, just before landing, that they had a call. It was from Vorden. He updated them on the information they had found out about a specific type of Dalki called the new Gen. The bad feeling that Sam seemed to be coming true, although there wasn't much information other than the Dalki being slightly different from what they had seen before.

It seemed like the Dalki themselves didn't know much about them either. Still, Sam needed to proceed with the plan and chose not to stray from the course. He also updated Vorden on what to do for the time being. He was to keep moving forward, for now it was fine if they left the Dalki as they were. Even if they attacked them from behind or went forward, it wouldn't disrupt their plan.

Sam was interested in talking to them some more if things didn't go exactly the way he wanted as well.

'A split between the Dalki is a good sign, maybe I could..no...We stick to the plan, keep going forward, and... we're going to kill the Demon tier beast.' Sam thought in his head.

The plan to kill the demon tier beast was Sam's main goal all along. Doing so would ruin the enemy's morale, stop them from creating more Dalki, and also, according to their information, killing one would mean that Quinn had obtained both of them due to the beast's special ability.

Killing the current Dalki wasn't going to help, and they needed to get rid of Dalki's goal.

'I'm not sure this is the right thing, but if Graham is planning what I think he is... then this will be our only chance.'

Upon landing on the Dalki planets, they noticed that they were less terraformed than the planets owned by the humans. Humans had tried to change the land somewhat to make it more habitable for every planet that they had.

Since the Dalki had low numbers, it made sense that they wouldn't bother trying to change the whole planet and just the areas where they lived. Because of this, though, mostly the Dalki planets followed a similar pattern .

The planet was overrun with forest, large lumps of rock that constituted barren lands, and then there were huge ice capes similar to the one they were currently standing on.

Although the patterns they produced on the ground were quite interesting, they looked like waves frozen in place all over, some larger than others.

Walking through the tearing, they were quite cautious about everything, but they had a strong force with them.

Layla, Sam, Logan, and Dennis were from the Cursed faction leaders. Then from the vampire side, there was Vincent on his own, but he did have those in the tenth family as well. For one, Xander had come on the trip while leaving Timmy behind to take care of most things in the family.

The vampires in this group weren't many, adding up to a hundred or so members at most, but they were vampires that Xander said he trusted within the family. Many of them had even volunteered, saying they wanted to help Quinn.

Lastly, from the other humans travelling with them, Peach, Ivy, and Ruby were there. Peach and Ivy were the leaders of the Daisy faction, and there was a large number of those from the Daisy group with them.

Ruby was close to Arthur, and the reason why she insisted on coming was that they still hadn't found her daughter. Her daughter wasn't on any of the planets they had reclaimed, and with no one to ask, they could only hope that the Dalki were keeping her somewhere for some reason.

"Do we really have so little information on this New Gen Dalki," Layla said as they continued to move on foot rather than use the vehicles.

This was because Sam wanted to look at this new Gen before facing them. How many spikes they had was his primary concern.

"I can bet on a few things from the knowledge that is in here," Logan said, tapping his finger on his head a few times. "The Dalki were created with a basis of different DNA that the vampires gathered at the time when they were trying to develop human substitutes, after all.

"Slight variations in genes perhaps would create a better substitute or wouldn't come with the defects they were looking for. This is one of the reasons why there is such a difference in strength between different Dalki. If they can condense the information of all of the current Dalki and use that information somehow, they can create more useful Dalki.

"My other guess is using the energy of the other half of the Demon tier beast, they have created a stronger Dalki. Rather than try to create as many of the Dalki as they could, like Jim had originally done, they just focused on creating the strongest."

Listening to Logan talk wasn't giving them confidence, especially since the Dalki were a frightening existence to begin with.

"What's the worst outcome? I mean out of the two." Layla asked.

"That would be if they combined both of them," Logan replied.

Since it hadn't come up as one of the options, Layla didn't want to think about it.

"It is troublesome. The Dalki being condensed like this isn't good either. One Horn was incredibly strong. Imagine if they had attacked with Slicer One Horn and Graham at the same time." Sam said.

"My guess was they were being cautious of Richard. Which is why he also had defensive measures in place, such as Oscar. If they managed to regain the strength that they have lost and are now fighting together, it would be tough."

The group was coming close to the source of readings, so Sam told the others to get some rest, eat up, and reenergize themselves. While the leaders would continue ahead to scout the area.

After all, the energy readings didn't tell them the numbers of the Dalki, so they were curious and alert. Eventually, after travelling a good distance away from the others, they came across something. It was the top of the fortress, and this one looked to be a bit wider than the others, but it was still quite close in size.

The group hid behind a giant landmass, and standing behind it, they could see far ahead and observed the fortress carefully.

"Remind me, do the Dalki have good eyesight like us?" Dennis asked.

"Not as good as vampires'," Vincent said. "At least not the old ones."

Looking out, they were trying to see if they could catch something important. It would be hard since the fortress itself was a solid wall, and most of the Dalki would be inside, but maybe along the top, they would be able to see something staring out, and to their amazement, they actually did.

The only thing was they had to rub their eyes a couple of times to make sure what they were seeing was correct.

"That can't be... can it?" Layla asked while glancing at the others around her.

Although they couldn't see how many spikes most of the Dalki had, one that stood in the centre appeared a bit more Human than the others. For one, its skin was mostly white, with scales running up it.

It reminded them of Borden when he would change slightly. There was still the tail feature and their gigantic size, but their frame looked different from anything they had seen before. However, that wasn't the shocking thing about them.

No, it was because, without a doubt, this Dalki, in particular, had a resemblance to someone they all knew. Seeing the Dalki, tears ran down Layla's cheek as she remembered what had happened.

"How could they do this…how could they use her like this?!"

*****

# Chapter 1514 - Searching For The Leader
Sam's group wasn't the only one heading into the Dalki part of the Solar system. The Earthborn group was still busy reclaiming the lost planets in their section, and they were moving unhurriedly since many vampire leaders were helping them out.

Cooperation wasn't their strongest strength, and at the same time, they were waiting for an update on the situation with Sach. Still, after dealing with One Horn, they would soon start to speed up ahead. The Graylash family, led By Owen and Nicu, proceeded remarkably quickly, only a little behind the others.

From the Cursed family section, the one leading the charge of the war with the vampire subclasses was Sunny. She was also on her way, heading towards the Dalki part of the solar system. Bonny and Void were no longer with them since the task was far too dangerous and sent back to one of the Earthborn groups instead.

During her flight through space, Sunny had received an update from Sam.

"Sunny, you've done a good job, and the subclasses lost were under our estimations. I must congratulate you on your performance." She heard Sam's voice on the ship intercom. The latter was yet to land on a planet.

By her side, Sunny still had Rokene and another Female vampire who was there for support, listening in on everything. Sunny was one of the very few vampires who had left most of her castle vampires and inner castle vampires back in the vampire settlement.

"Thank you, but you don't have to flatter me. I know what needs to be done. I assume you didn't call me just to congratulate me." Sunny asked, wanting to get straight down to business.

"You're correct. We have received an update from Vorden regarding something new happening with the Dalki. He was unsure of trusting them, but in the end, I decided to let them live in return for information.

"There is something that you need to be careful about. There is something called New Gen Dalki, and they might be stronger than what you have faced before. If that is the case, I would suggest, at the worst, abandoning the subclasses and regrouping with another of the Cursed faction groups. Let the subclasses do as they wish.

"But I hope the situation won't come to that because I have another task for you. When gathering information from the Dalki, I asked where Graham would be and what planet he resided on. The answer was surprising, to say the least.

"Their base isn't located on any of the planets; rather, they ride in a ship that's the size of a large moon. Apparently, they had taken large parts of land from the planets or the moons near them to create it.

"I would like you to locate this ship. This is where Graham is most likely, and this is where the beast we are looking for will be."

Sunny had no problem with the mission and had accepted it. During her fight on the Dalki fortress, she realised that although the leaders were strong and able to take out the Dalki, what would have happened if they had attacked the vampires.

For one, the leaders would have never used beast gear, nor would they have had inner blood weapons. The leaders also didn't have haste to train and get stronger as Quinn had drilled into them.

It was quite possible that the Dalki would have quickly annihilated the whole vampire race as well.

"I guess everything that has happened has been for a reason." Sunny smiled.

The ship was heading towards one of the beast planets and was close enough to feel its gravitational pull onto the ship when Sunny was about to give instructions to steer away from the planet to search for the main Dalki ship.

They suddenly heard a beeping sound in the ship before she could order the move. Rokene rushed to one of the monitors to have a look at what was going on.

"Nina, activate the ship's defensive shields now!" Rokene shouted.

Nina quickly went over to the panel and followed the command. Usually, if an energy blast was detected, the shield would come online on its own. However, the ships the vampires used didn't have as strong shields as the Dalki motherships, but it was enough to survive a couple of attacks.

Quickly, Rokene rushed to the windshield, and he could see a black object heading their way. It wasn't large, but it was coming at a great speed, encased in what looked like flames. As it touched the shield, the shield could do nothing to slow it down as it pierced through it and hit right through one side of the ship.

"We've been hit, and it looks like more are coming our way. What do we do?" Rokene asked.

Sunny had to make a quick decision. The planet they were about to land on was one of the beast planets that showed readings of the Dalki, but she had just been tasked with something different. The question was can they get away? And if they failed and the ship was destroyed in space, they would lose all the subclasses as well.

While thinking, another object hit the ship, and the ship automatically sealed off that section to minimise the damage.

"Land the ship!" Sunny shouted.

Quickly, they activated the thrusters. The ship was large in the first place since it was a drop-ship filled with countless numbers of the subclasses. It started to head towards the planet, and at the same time, the enemy attacks had stopped.

'Was it trying to get us to land? And I don't see any of the Dalki fortresses anywhere...' Sunny thought. 'I guess I will have to deal with the Dalki here and whatever was making that attack and then head off to search. It will delay the mission, but I think we can deal with this quickly."

The ship was slowly approaching the orange-like wasteland of the surface. As they got closer and decided to steer in the direction of the enemy, they spotted someone on the ground.

"Is that just one Dalki?" Rokene asked, doubting her eyes.

What they were seeing was indeed just a single Dalki. It stood there surrounded by countless black spears dug into the ground. The black spears didn't actually look like spears but were just long and pointed at the end. It was a simple object created from the Dalki material.

It was then that the Dalki smiled and picked up one of the spears while staring at the ship.

"Too slow." It said as it threw the spear, aiming right for the back engine part. The spear passed through, and a loud explosion shook the ship as it began to tilt due to the impact. The front of the ship opened up, and the vampires jumped, landing on the ground. At the same time, the ship crashed not far away from them.

"Don't worry," Sunny said after getting up. "If there is a Dalki here, there will be another ship, and that won't be enough to kill the subclasses."

Sunny was right, as the containers were in good condition even against the attack. Soon the doors started to open on the containers, and out came rushing all of the subclasses at once.

"Now, this is interesting," Dalki said. "This will be a nice test to see if I can take you all on."

A single Dalki... Sunny couldn't imagine there was only one Dalki on this planet when she was expecting to face a whole colony. However, something else was distressing her even more. In the description of Dalki, Sam said they were all to look out for and to report immediately if they saw a Dalki sporting human clothes.

———

On a distant and far away planet, not in the beast solar system. There was one person who was going through an immense amount of pain. Not for a second had the pain receded since starting this process, but he couldn't give up.

Still, to make him aware of his progress and how long he had to continue suffering like this, the system was there to tell him.

# Chapter 1515 - Meeting The New Gen
"How do we know that both fortresses were equal in strength?" Nicu slammed his hand on the table in frustration.

The Graylash group that Owen was leading was heading off towards the Dalki side of the beast planet. At the same time, the other group being led by Grim was about to arrive as well and was just a short distance away from them, only heading in a different direction. The group was in a garden-like hall with a stone table set in the middle at the ship's centre.

There was even a pond nearby with a small flowing waterfall. It certainly gave a calming feeling, but it felt strange to have a place like this in the ship, but that was just how Owen had always done things—he wanted to feel comfortable wherever he was.

Lifting his fan over his mouth, Owen let out a chuckle.

"What you say is true, but I thought the rules just stated who could clear a fortress quicker? Besides, it wasn't like there was a prize for this event or anything. Let's just say that they were stronger than the one I fought."

Nate, who was also at the stone table, felt a little uncomfortable, but he was just thankful that Owen wasn't so…childish. He was happy to concede defeat and go with Nicu's ways; in fact, he had been doing this the whole time.

Nicu wanted to make it a competition, and Owen had agreed; now, he was complaining again, and Owen was taking a step back once again.

"Pft." Nicu scoffed, crossing his arms. "And unlike us, you had a lot more people on your side."

"Ahem," Clearing his throat, Nate interrupted to talk about the matter at hand.

"We got a report from Sam. We need to be careful of the new Gen Dalki on these planets. I would suggest we slow down our pace a little and fight together from this point forward. It was good to let the humans and vampires fight separately, but now we might need everyone's strength. After all, I'm sure you all heard what happened with the Earthborn group led by Sach."

For the first time in a while, Owen had an expression of sorrow on his face. Although he covered up his face with his steel fan for most of the time, it wasn't hard to judge his emotions from his eyes, and Nate understood him very well.

Everything was going well, and all groups were reporting good news, but then the report about Sach's group arrived. In truth, they perhaps should be celebrating that One Horn was dealt with, yet… the loss of their comrades was much heavier.

"There still has been no report on Graham, so we need to keep an eye on that as well. Is there any update from vampires about Quinn? Is he on his way back? I've been keeping his shadow active for a while." Nate asked.

Nicu remained quiet for some time because he was in contact with the eighth family, who had the ability of telepathy. He was communicating with the vampire Shelter, who would, in turn, forward the message to Quinn's group.

"Yes... they're alright, but Quinn seems to be in the middle of something. Right now, they are protecting him and are fighting. Some reinforcements have also been sent from the settlement to support, so they should be fine." Nicu conveyed to the others in the room after disconnecting.

'Doing something? What are you up to, Quinn?' Nate wondered.

It sounded strange but knowing Quinn, it had to be important, and he was glad that the vampires were actually trying to protect him earnestly.

Eventually, the fleet of ships started to pull in towards their destination, a Dalki planet. However, there was a very serious look on everyone's faces this time, including Nicu's.

It was a relief for Nate because he was worried that others might continue to see this as a game. It would, of course, be their downfall if they didn't change their attitude.

When landing, the group followed Nate's suggestion, and now, the vampires were mixed in better among the humans since they will be fighting side by side. There were about a hundred thousand soldiers in the army, all assigned into platoons, with each platoon having five or so vampires.

At the front of the army stood a large group of mechs acting as scouts. They soon spread out and began searching for any sign of the Dalki or the fortress. They had purposely landed away from the energy signals to avoid confrontation as soon as they landed.

The planet they were currently at had enormous empty craters on the surface. They were quite deep, and some even stretched out more than a mile before returning to the level surface, and soon there would be another crater. With their enhanced sensors, the mechs were a big help in this terrain.

They knew the enemy wouldn't be on a plain or levelled surface; rather, they would hide.

"Still see nothing up ahead, but we are about to enter a huge crater." One of the Mechs reported coming to a halt and standing just on the edge of a crater. He was about to look down, but all of a sudden, a large hand had pierced right through the mech's headpiece.

A large arm was seen sticking through the mech, and the next second it was thrown off, falling to the side.

"Attack! I repeat we're under at- "The other one in the mech suit had only said a few words before it had fallen as well.

After a few moments, the main force witnessed two Dalki slowly stepping out of the crater, and soon there were more.

"Four spikes, three spikes…these are high-level Dalki? I can't even see a single one or two spiked Dalki!" Nate commented while summoning his shield with the shadow.

Just then, Owen made his move, activating the lighting on his foot; he charged forward.

"Mech Unit, fall back! Nicu, I hate to say this, but it would be a pleasure to have your help in this!" Owen shouted.

The four spiked Dalki are immensely strong, and it wasn't too long back when Owen would drastically struggle against one, but he had improved as well. But, just because he had made vast improvements and had confidence, he couldn't say the same for the others.

If the four spike and three spike got into the army's centre, they would cause a rampage. Looking ahead, Owen had a fist full of lighting. The ground was being ripped apart as he ran with his hand down.

However, as Owen concentrated on one, he soon saw another three spiked Dalki leap over his head and head straight at the crowd.

"Leave it!" Nicu shouted as he jumped up and pulled out his sword. The outside started to glow red, and Nicu slashed it several times in midair. The power of the beast equipment, along with his natural talent, gave him more additional strength and speed than before.

The Dalki was cut into pieces when he landed, and Owen was thankful he had a strong partner on his side.

"He did well against the three spikes, but there's a big jump in power whenever we face these guys!" Owen said as he suddenly accelerated and struck the Dalki right in its stomach. Its whole body lit up and blew before being shot back into the large crater.

Owen wasn't sure the Dalki was down for the count, so he went to look over and see if there were any more, but he paused for a second as he did.

"No…no.." Owen couldn't help but drop his metal fan onto the floor.

He found the Dalki fortress in the crater, but there was an army of more than a hundred dalki, and all of them were three or four spikes, and among them, he could see Dalki that had four spikes but appeared a little more... human.

Standing in the centre, on top of a tower in the fortress, was a male Dalki whose arms were covered in black scales, but his bare body and face remained mostly human. He looked up at Owen, showing its black eyes without a trace of white, a smile formed on his face.

"Welcome."

*****

# Chapter 1516 - New Gen Succeed
At first, when Owen could see the number of three spike and four spike Dalki, he thought they were in for a serious problem. For a second, he even believed that the new generation of Dalki had to be referring to them.

After all, the group had never come across such a large number of high spiked Dalki, and the enemy could have easily used such Dalki in the first war to take over the earth if they wished.

This all changed when Owen's eyes focused on the human-like Dalki standing on top of the fortress in the crater.

Although he had the same number of spikes as the others, the level of threat Owen felt from him was very high.

Immediately, the Dalki started to run up the crater and charged towards the army. The platoons also got into the action and moved forward to take down the enemy once and for all.

'What do I do? That Dalki doesn't seem to move anytime soon, so should I stay here and protect the others...or should I be the first to make a move against the new Gen Dalki.' Owen was in a dilemma.

That was until he saw the chaos on the battlefield. The Dalki at the front were hit by countless different abilities and even got slashed with beast weapons, but these attacks had a negligible effect. One of the four spikes punched the ground, destroying the ground beneath them. At the same time, another Dalki delivered a kick so powerful that it killed a row of men, despite them wearing their gear.

At the same time, even those from the Graylash family were struggling. Their lightning powers were effective against the Dalki but could barely hurt the latter, much less kill them.

Owen could see one of his white robbed men jump and then moving like a lighting bolt, he had hit the Dalki straight in the stomach and caused it to bleed on its scales, but before the men could go for another attack, the Dalki placed its hand on former's head and ripped it apart from his torso.

"This is chaos!" Nate shouted as he punched a three spike Dalki right below its chin, sending it in the air, but he had no time to finish it off as another came towards him. He lifted his trusty shield in time, and as the Dalki's fist hit the shield, a smile appeared on Nate's face.

It began to glow, and the energy blasted the Dalki into the crater's curved part in the next second, destroying it. For Nate, the shield was great for combat if the enemy was attacking him from all sides.

He was faster than most Dalki, and it didn't matter if his own powers weren't enough to kill them; the demon tier shield would do that for him.

"You are a troublesome one." A voice asserted; Nate saw a hand in front of him, about to reach his face upon turning around. He looked into the Dlaki's eyes for a second, and all he could see was darkness. This was the humanoid Dalki, who had left the fortress and joined in on the fight.

'He's fast, faster than me...I can't get the shield in time. I'll have to use the shadow.' Nate immediately reacted.

Before the hand reached him, though, a strong Blood Swipe came and slightly changed the hand's trajectory. A red sword came swinging down the next moment, slashing at the Dalki's arm.

"Nicu!" Nate was surprised.

"Our people are dying, and this one is too fast for you," Nicu said. "Your shield can deal with most of them; leave this to me."

For a second, Nate wondered if he should help or not, but the next few actions from the two had proved what Nicu said was right. This Dalki was unusually fast. The more spikes they had, the faster their speed and power, but this one could keep up with Nicu without getting any injuries on its body.

Others around them heard several clashes just in a few seconds as Nicu slashed with his sword, and the Dalki tried to counterattack, going for his head. Every single blow from the Dalki had the power to finish off the young leader in one shot, but Nicu was somehow able to hold out.

Looking around, Nate could tell their army was losing men and losing them incredibly fast. The enemy only numbered to a hundred or so and was fighting against an army of close to a hundred thousand people, yet it was the army that was being slaughtered.

'Right now, I need to do what I can.' Nate thought as he went into the fray, hoping to deal with them as instructed.

Meanwhile, seeing that Nicu was dealing with the strange Dalki, Owen decided to protect his people as much as possible. Eventually, summoning his soul weapon and throwing it up into the sky, he moved to change the tide of the battle.

Each lightning strike from above would stun the Dalki for a few seconds, giving him a chance to take them on one at a time. Just as Owen was getting ready to move forward, three four-spike Dalki surrounded him.

"Get out of my way!" Owen cried in anger. A single bolt from the sky struck the Dalki, stunning one of them on the spot. Owen quickly hit another in the stomach, but it stood its ground and kicked Owen right in the chest, sending him flying back.

Blood trickled down from the corner of his mouth, but he needed to get up and deal with them quickly.

'I need to stay calm…I need to think of a way out of this.'

The fight continued between the humans and the new set of Dalki. Every time Owen would see some type of opening and deal with one of them, stronger ones would charge towards him, and honestly, he was getting quite tired.

With Nate, the understanding of what his shield could do started to spread among the enemy Dalki. Even with his vampire and Qi powers, a four spike was still difficult for him to deal with. Thankfully, the Demon tier shield gave him extra stats to help him deal with a few of them.

Yet, it was clear there was a certain strategy in place. All those that would give the Dalki trouble were targeted and surrounded. At the same time, they weren't necessarily trying to kill them and were slowly being forced down, not allowing them to help the others.

Even Nicu, who was trying his best to hurt the four spike, had eventually caused some cuts and bruises here and there, but the Dalki hadn't changed its own attack pattern and just continued.

It was hard for them to tell how long had passed, but they had been fighting non-stop, to the point where each of them had to now worry about their MC cells. Nicu and Nate were in a better state since drinking some of the Dalki blood of their fallen targets gave them an energy boost.

Nate had used his shadow in a dangerous situation, even protecting those around him.

On the other hand, Nicu was getting frustrated and was making more mistakes and even got hit on his shoulder by the human Dalki, and was now forced to step back.

Eventually, Nicu, Owen, and Nate had backed themselves up towards each other without realising it. Around ten or so vampires were still fighting, and nearly two-thirds of the Dalki were taken out, but out of the hundred thousand they had brought with them, these vampires were the only ones left.

"Regroup!" Nicu shouted, and the vampires soon came towards them, and now huddled up and tired, they all wondered what to do. Owen no longer had his soul weapon out because it was using too much of his energy.

"We have to get out of this," Owen said.

The Human Dalki was smiling at them, and the other Dalki started to walk ahead towards them as well. Around twenty of them were still alive, and only the last few people from the attack group.

"Is this how it ends for us?" Nate gritted his teeth. He tried to contact Sam upon seeing the disadvantageous situation during the fight, but there was no response. Honestly, he was worried that everyone at the moment who was in the Dalki solar system was facing a similar problem.

"There are not that many left." Owen smiled. "Why don't we have a competition to see how many we can take out."

While saying these words, Owen found it hard even to lift up his arms.

The Dalki charged at them, and the group of vampires was ready to protect their leader. But after a few steps, the Dalki noticed something from the side; however, it was a little too late for them as a tunnel of ice came out from the side.

The second it touched the Dalki, their bodies began to freeze on the spot. Soon, three Dalki were caught, and half their bodies were frozen. Just then, a large blade appeared and sliced one of the Dalki in half the next second.

"….What is she doing here," Nate said in disbelief. "I've never been this pleased to see her."

*****

# Chapter 1517 - Constant Internal Struggle
A mixed bag of emotions. Honestly, when Erin had decided to leave the others and go on her own, away from her friends, she was heartbroken inside. She had already lost her family once, and because of that, she naturally pushed others away.

Yet, slowly, some people had managed to move into her heart once again, and Erin became a little soft towards them. She had decided to get stronger because she wanted to protect those around her, but the one thing she never thought she would have to do, was to fight those closest to her.

It was a thought that she couldn't bear, something that she couldn't imagine, and in the end, she had decided to leave the settlement. The teleporter in the tenth castle had been used to send Erin back to the Cursed ship.

When Erin reached her destination, she didn't greet the others or inform them of what she was doing. Instead, she had decided to do something else, and that was to get as far away from everyone as possible. There were a few things she had learned about herself, like, similar to a vampire, Erin could also use influence skills on people.

Although it seemed like this wasn't as strong as her counterparts, it was enough to convince the person-in-charge of the teleporter room.

'I have to get away from the Cursed faction and any of the vampires. Even on this ship, I can still feel it,' she thought.

Eventually, she headed through the teleporter. After going through several steps, she found herself on one of the three Earthborn Planets that were considered safe. The planet seemed quite peaceful, having hardly suffered from Dalki attacks, and there were plenty of people in the Shelter.

In fact, there were so many people that Erin felt a little trapped. After all, many from the other Shelters had to come to this place, including Civilians. In the end, the Earthborn group had to build two shelters on the planet to accommodate everyone.

One, for the general civilians and a group of men to protect the place. While the original was for the bulk of the military. They built the Shelters relatively close to each other; if there was any trouble, the military could come and help.

In the first place, they only considered this safe to do so because the Dalki attacks were so scarce.

One day, covering herself in a grey robe, Erin walked down the street and entered a tavern. Unlike vampires, she needed to eat regular food.

Eventually, the server came and served a steaming hot meal. Pulling out a money card, she proceeded to pay the man with her credits, but there seemed to be an error when attempting it to go through.

"Right, sorry, but it seems like the payment didn't quite work. Do you have another money card on you, perhaps?" The man politely asked.

The money card she was using was her own, and this money was from what she used to get from being part of the Cursed faction. They would hardly ever need to use it, though, for two reasons: Being close to the Cursed leaders meant it was almost impossible for them to pay for things, and if they did need money, they had a member of the Green family who was happy to top up their cards whenever wished.

However, she was no longer on the Cursed planets, the vampire settlement, or in contact with Logan to get his help. For now, to escape her predicament, she had no choice but to remove her hood and look the man in the eyes.

Seeing her beautiful long blonde hair and pretty face, the man was almost getting red just looking at her.

And just as she was about to use her powers.

"It's okay, the meal's on the house." The man suddenly smiled and walked away.

She was left alone, in the corner with her food, and dug in quite quickly.

'I can't keep using my powers like that…it feels wrong.' Erin thought. 'But that means I'll have to come up with a way to make some money.'

After finishing her meal, she eventually saw that everyone's eyes were glued to the screen. As for what they were watching, it was none other than Quinn. He had returned from the vampire world, and right now, they were heading to the Daisy faction base.

She continued to watch every bit of it, as Quinn was filled with anger and had killed the Dalki with ease. Those in the shop couldn't stop talking about the whole event. When the broadcast ended, they continued to discuss it for hours while Erin was left with her own thoughts.

'Quinn, you have gotten so strong. I thought maybe I could get as strong as you…but now I'm a little scared of what will happen if I do.'

Right now, she couldn't feel the urge, but it was because she could tell that there wasn't a vampire in the Shelter they were currently at. Perhaps if she lived a successful life away from vampires, away from them all, she would be alright.

Still, there was something at the back of her mind that was itching her bit by bit, even if there weren't any vampires. Thankfully due to Leo's training, she could control it, at least this much.

Putting on her hood, Erin continued to wonder for the next couple of days, but that wasn't all she did. At night she would wander the streets, even though she didn't know why she was doing it, but it was as if she was looking for something.

Then one night, while roaming through the streets, it hit her like a wave. An incredible feeling rushed through her mind, and her back was covered in sweat. Like radar, she could quickly pinpoint where this sensation was coming from. Running through the roads of the Shelter, she turned down an alleyway and saw two glowing red eyes.

Without a second thought, she pulled out her smaller katana-like blade and dashed forward, slashing at the vampire. The attack was swift. The vampire didn't even have time to react and was killed on the spot, sliced in half.

A human was trembling and frightened on the street floor down the alleyway.

"Thank you…thank you so much that man came out of nowhere."

Turning around, Erin looked at the person, a young woman. Walking forward, she had the biggest smile on her face.

"No worries. I'm glad to see that you're alright."

The woman didn't know why, but getting up, she immediately ran away and headed back home. What Erin didn't know was her smile didn't look like one that was happy, but one of someone who was enjoying the moment.

Touching her face, she could feel the edge of her smile not going down.

Seeing that the person had run away from her at that moment. Erin fell to her knees.

"What have I become…what is this…but that feeling, I can't forget that feeling," Erin muttered. She knew that she had enjoyed the sudden feeling of killing the vampire.

She was afraid that even if she chose to live a life in seclusion, she would eventually lose out and seek this feeling once again. As she was deciding if she was ready to give up or not... but a certain person's smiling face flashed in her head.

"Layla... I miss the days when I just talked with you; I missed seeing you drool over that idiot Quinn; I miss the scaredy-cat Peter and the charismatic Vorden. I just want to go back to those days. Is that so much to ask?" Erin sighed.

Getting up from her feet, she took a deep breath and placed her blade away.

"I have to control this urge, and I have to do it if I ever want to return to them one day. And I know I will overcome this."

Knowing Quinn's plans were: the alliance between the humans and the vampires. And she was an existence that could sink that plan, so no matter what, she needed to control her urges if she wanted to help in this war.

*****

# Chapter 1518 - The Vampire Hunter's Problems (Part 1)
Rumours were starting to spread within the Earthborn faction that perhaps there soon would be a fight on their hands. Everyone knew that it would happen at some point and time, but those that were in the Shelter a little away from the military were frightened. Of course, they would be, since they had little defences.

While walking the streets, Erin was listening in on all the surrounding conversations. It was a skill that she had often done when travelling with Leo. Although vampires had great hearing, all the noise at once made it hard to focus on just one, making it a skill she had needed to pick up.

"I heard there is a mass recruitment in the other Shelters. The Earthborn faction wants to get everyone with some type of useful ability to head towards the frontline."

"I mean, at some point, if the military and the other factions don't win this, then we would have to fight for our lives anyway."

"They're not doing their job. We should just head to Earth, or try to head to a different solar system where the Dalki can't reach us. That should be possible, right? I don't know about you, but I'm still scared about the vampires. I heard they attacked and sucked someone dry just because they looked at them funny."

As expected, Erin could only hear news about the upcoming fight. What she was surprised about, though, was the fact that there was no news about Quinn after he had made that declaration to the world. Based on the way the Dalki had acted in the past, the Dhampir had been sure they would react, yet so far there had been nothing.

'I wonder if the Dalki are planning something. Everyone is too scared to act and is just waiting, but if we just sit here and wait while our enemy is preparing to get stronger and improving, it will be our loss.' Erin thought as she took a deep breath.

Every once in a while, she would get reminders of what had occurred the other day. She had been trying to harness those feelings… but right now, the young woman needed to find a way to make money.

"I heard that the new General Longblade has sent over his right-hand men to this Shelter, Rafer Lyle. I thought it was to protect us, but I've heard the guy has been looking for people willing to go out on a hunting expedition with them!"

"I mean, we still need crystals and equipment times like these, and although there are a lot of people here that aren't strong enough to go against the Dalki we could still do some fighting."

This seemed like a good way out of her financial situation. At the same time it would be a good way to help her with her personal problems. So far only two things allowed her to keep sane. One of them was meditation, but that severely limited the amount of training time. The other was fighting other things that weren't vampires.

After gathering enough information, Erin discovered the location of the recruitment process for the beast hunting teams. Just like how Travelers would be ranked and be allowed to search for beasts, the same would be done here.

The Dhampir soon arrived at a courtyard of a grand manor that was being used by Rafer and other high-ranking officers during their stay here. All those that wanted to take part had gathered in an open field and a test was being conducted.

The test was simple enough, they were asked to fight against one of the Earthborn soldiers. After a little sparring match. Based on their results, they would be put into different groups.

Behind the soldiers there were three circles that had been drawn on the ground and each one was being told to go into a different circle.

"Next!" Rafer shouted out to all of them, with his hands by his side. He was quite the large and busy man, yet he still had a smile on his face most of the time. He also took his work seriously and knew when to be kind and tough on others.

In the middle section there was a red haired man who looked like a teenager walking forward.

'Huh, isn't that?' For a second, Erin was sure she had recognised him.

As the soldier charged forward to attack, Berg spun around, avoiding the sword. It looked slow at first but then from one of his elbows emitted fire from behind. Using the power of his flames he accelerated the spinning in his body and hit the soldier in the side of the head knocking him down to the floor.

It was the first contestant that was able to completely overwhelm the soldiers out of all of the ones who had taken part so far.

"Power of fire? Doesn't that mean he's from the Sunshield family? I guess the red hair makes sense now."

There were plenty of whispers after seeing him in action, and Erin was right. Berg was someone who had also gone to the same academy as them. He was a favourite and a talented student, rising to the top. At one point and time, Erin had treated Berg as her rival. However, it hadn't taken her long to realise that she needed to worry about others if she wanted to be the best.

A childish dream that seemed so long ago, yet it had been merely a few years…

"Third circle!" Rafer announced.

The third circle had the least amount of people, there were only around eight in the group in total. Then there was the middle section with around fifteen or so, and lastly the end circle that had the most number of people, numbering around fifty.

It was clear that the circle Berg was in, was considered the best.

"Next." Rafer called out, and it was finally time for Erin to go out.

Currently, Erin had the large sword on her back not just in its specially made scabbard, but she also had it wrapped in cloth. Not only would it be strange for someone to have their own Demon tier weapon, but since it used to belong to the previous Supreme Commander Oscar, everybody in the military would instantly recognise it. Still, even on her back, she could still activate it and benefit from the additional strength a Demon tier would usually produce.

Looking at her opponent in front of her, the soldier wielded a long sword. Erin pulled out her katana blade. It gathered a lot of attention due to its shape and red colour. One could tell it was quite high-level, only they didn't know that it wasn't a beast weapon at all.

The match began, and the man charged in, the first thing Erin did was sweep her foot across the ground, chucking some dirt into his eyes. At that moment, she struck to his side, but the soldier was able to block.

She went for another attack which was a little faster and hit the shoulder guard of the shoulder. This continued, and the soldier was clearly being overwhelmed, but eventually, he stomped on the ground, and a pillar rose in front of Erin, hitting her in the stomach.

A second before it reached her, she lept back and fell on her back side.

"A speed user. Although your ability is not great, you knew the right spots to attack. You've earned a place in the second circle." The soldier instructed after giving her a hand.

This had, of course, been Erin's plan all along. The Dhampir didn't wish to sit out, though she didn't consider it wise to go in as the first circle either. She had a feeling that something was up anyway.

After the testing was complete, Rafer went to the first circle, where Berg and the others were.

"All of you will head to the other Shelter and prepare yourselves!"

They soon looked at themselves with confused looks. Why were they going to the other Shelter if this was meant to be a beast hunting force, but the others soon cached on.

"You disappoint your fellow humans. With as much power as you have, you decided to hide it and run away to this Shelter! You should be on the front lines fighting with that strength."

The others couldn't really argue with this, because they knew that they had hid themselves. Perhaps there was even more today that had done the same thing as Erin not showing her full power and had figured out what the army was trying to do before them.

For a second, though, Rafer looked towards Berg.

"You, kid, how old are you?"

"Nineteen, sir." Berg replied.

"And you, the one in the hood…come forward." Rafer requested.

It was clear that he was talking to Erin, and her heart started to thump. Not yet, she wasn't ready to go on the front-line just yet. Not when she would be placed among other vampires.

# Chapter 1519 - The Vampire Hunter's Problems (Part 2)
Erin did as she had been told and walked out of her circle. The others weren't sure why these two had been called out, though the young woman feared that they might have realised that she had been holding back.

Rafer first looked towards Berg before explaining: "You two will be coming with me. We will be making a special beast hunting team. As for those within the second circle, you'll be hunting Advanced tier beasts and King tier with the support of some military personnel.

"The first circle group will be fighting Intermediate and Basic tier beasts. We'll assign you a captain, and you'll listen to their orders, understand?!"

The others didn't disagree with this, and the only ones that seemed somewhat upset by their situation were the ones in the third circle that were forced to move to another Shelter.

"Please... My family lives here. I need to protect them if the Dalki come!" An older man ran out, getting on his hands and knees to beg Rafer to be allowed to stay.

"I understand that this is a hard time for everyone. I promise that we will ensure that your family will be safe here. However, we need more people who are strong like you to fight the Dalki with everything we have. If you think you alone can make a difference, should the Dalki invade after they have gone through all of us, I'm afraid you're living in a fantasy and not the real world."

The man pleaded some more, yet to no avail. His head sulked as he gave up on the idea. It was true he wanted to look after his family, but it was also true that he didn't want to go on the frontline against those beasts.

Eventually, heading into the manner, there seemed to be some sort of special meeting that had occurred. For now, Erin had sat down on a sofa, and Berg was sitting opposite her with his arms crossed. He had no beast gear on, and he was in a sleeveless shirt.

It looked like he had a rough time, perhaps it was due to what had happened to the Sunshield family. With them being disbanded and mostly destroyed, only a few of them were left alive. There were more than a handful of factions and families that held grudges against them, because of the Big Four. In the past, two of the families seemed to bully their way through compared to other families the most.

One being the Sunshield family, the other one those under the Truedream flag. Berg started to try to get a peak at the hooded girl's face, when he eventually had caught a good look.

"Erin... I can't believe it. What are you doing here?" Berg stood up in shock, before immediately sitting down. Then, a little worried, he whispered. "Aren't you with Pure?!"

When Erin had left the military academy, there were many that had accused her of being part of Pure, and that they had taken her back. It looked like some still had this impression of her. With no need to hide who she was, and not really caring, she pulled her hood down, revealing her blonde hair.

"Calm down, I'm not with Pure. That was all a set-up. I was with the Cursed faction for a while, and now I'm on my own due to none of your business." Erin claimed, crossing her legs and looking away, wondering what was taking the others so long.

It was clear that Erin didn't want to talk based on the short interaction the two had had, but Berg couldn't help but stare at her. For more reasons than one, Erin was an ice queen beauty at the school.

Yet how, in the short time he didn't know her, had she become even more beautiful. On top of that, he knew her ability was ice, so why hadn't she used it.

Just as Berg was about to pop the question, the doors opened and Rafer was seen walking through. There was another soldier by his side, and what looked like two other Travellers. From what Erin had gathered, they had done similar tests around the Shelter beforehand. Of course, one centre couldn't just measure everyone that needed to be measured.

Although she had also heard news that they were forcing some people to take tests as well. Whether it was right or wrong was a different thing. She could tell that fear was running through the military, of experiencing the same thing that they had done once before.

Before Rafer spoke, he looked at Erin for a few seconds. He was surprised to see such a young woman under the hood. He wondered why such a beautiful person would cover their face like so, but he knew it was rude to stare and went on with the reason they had been gathered.

"Sorry for springing such a surprise on all of you." Rafer apologised as he gestured the other two to sit on the third sofa that was positioned around the square table in the room. Rafer was the only one that was standing while he made his announcement.

Erin glanced at the two others, and tried to sense if there was anything strange about them. Neither of them had Qi, nor were they vampires, that was for sure, but their beast gear was at a good level.

One was a short white haired young adult with a crossbow type beast gear weapon. Something that Erin rarely saw. The range on a crossbow was less than that of a bow, but the advantage was usually the power and speed at which a beast crossbow could be used.

"Now that everyone is here, I want to inform you about the task our special team has." Refer explained. "The white haired Traveller goes by the name of Conan. He used to be part of an A Rank faction and was an A Rank Traveller in the past."

This had come as a surprise to Erin. For one, she thought for sure that if there were any A Rank Travellers they would have been sent to the other Shelter, so why was he here?

"Then we have another Traveller, that goes by the name of Brook." Rafer continued.

Knowing that the white haired man was Conan, Brook was clearly the muscular black man who had tribal tattoos going all the way down his forearms. Although his tattoos and muscles screamed intimidating, his smile showed another story.

When he looked at everyone, he seemed like the most gentle person in the world. It was such a nice smile that some were even put off by it. His choice of weapon on his back was two sickles. Something that would have been used as a farming tool in the past, but since they were beast weapons, Erin was sure they were far more effective.

"Now, I don't want you guys to be shocked when I say this... but the reason we have gathered you all is that we have discovered the location of a Demon tier beast. One that if turned into another weapon might help us tip the scales of war into our favour."

Everyone in the room was left speechless. A Demon tier beast such a rare existence, and them, who felt like nobodies were going to go after it. It felt like an elaborate prank was being set up on them.

"I'll explain a little further for you all. All the factions on the other planets are busy, and I'm sure you know that the other planets are now in control of the Dalki. If anything, finding a Demon tier beast on the few planets that we have is a blessing.

"Also, it's not a humanoid beast, so you don't have to worry too much. No sorry, please do worry since it's a Demon tier beast, but not too much." Rafer started to chuckle, but no one else felt like laughing at this situation.

"How…how are we meant to fight such a thing, just with five of us? I heard all the leaders fought against the last one. How could we defeat such a thing on our own?!" Conan immediately questioned this entire idea.

"That's because you guys are special. I'm sure you know not every Demon tier beast is the same, and we have it on good terms that we should be able to achieve this task with just us."

Hearing this, the others wanted to pull out from the job, but could they even.

"What about me?" Erin asked. "I... am not strong like these guys. Why was I selected?"

She wasn't sure if Rafer was able to see through her facade or if it was something else, but she needed to know.

Scratching his head, Rafer gave her a surprising reply.

"I'm actually not too sure about that myself. You see, there is one more person that will be coming on this expedition with us. She was actually the one who gave us information on the Demon tier beast. The only thing she wanted in return was to accompany us… as well as for us to recruit 'a person in a grey hood, no matter what."

Just as Erin was beginning to guess who it could be, someone else stepped into the room, walking in with a staff in her hand.

"Well, it's been a long time, hasn't it?" Bliss greeted the Dhampir with a smile.
