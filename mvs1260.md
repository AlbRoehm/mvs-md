# Chapter 1260 - Confident Creatures
The fact that Leo and Erin were currently on the vampire planet was meant to be kept a secret from the others. After all, Leo held a high position in the vampire settlement as the tenth family’s vampire knight.

If it was any other time, Muka and perhaps Kazz would have questioned what he was even doing here, but the news that he had brought seemed to be more urgent, and with everything going on, what the tenth family were doing seemed to be the least of their worries.

After hearing the news, both Kazz and Muka looked at each other immediately.

"The Dalki, you mean they really have returned to this place. This whole matter seems to be getting more complicated by the second." Muka stated. "This is a matter that we may even have to talk to the king about, and at a time like this while everything is happening."

Judging from how Muka spoke, it was almost as if he wasn’t surprised that the Dalki had arrived but more so surprised at the timing of the whole thing.

"Why would the Dalki be here? Do you have an idea?" Paul asked.. "From what I have heard from Quinn, at the moment, they have launched a full attack on the humans. Their leaders and bulk of their forces are tied up, so why bother sending the Dalki here?" Paul questioned.

Although Paul knew about the origins of the Dalki from Quinn’s meetings as he informed everyone to keep them up to date on the matter, Paul did not know about specific details.

"I don’t know much about the Dalki. Many vampires don’t know about them." Kazz answered. "We know that the humans are in a battle against them. Maybe they came back as a type of revenge against us, but who knows."

Most of the leaders did know of the Dalki that included Muka, so he was debating how much to tell them or if it would even matter if they did know.

"The Leaders have never really worried about the Dalki. Them coming back here is not too much of a problem. The problem for me is who they might have returned with. For he had left with them, and this is someone who might also be on our suspect list for the missing vampires."

The person who Muka was thinking of, was none other than Jim.

Hearing this, Leo and Erin thought the vampire’s arrogance was showing. They knew more about the Dalki and their history compared to the others. When the Dlaki had left the vampire settlement, they were weak. This was most likely why they didn’t see the Dalki as a threat.

Of course, none of the leaders were ever worried about the Dalki returning for an attack, and hearing the news of the humans they always considered as weak, losing to their creation was even more reason for them to laugh. Still, with Leo and Erin having gone up against the four spike, they knew that the Dalki were strong and no laughing matter, even for the vampires.

"We were unable to see how many Dalki there were, but only two attacked us. We imagine that a group of them must have come. We were also quite far out in the settlement. I think we should take this threat seriously." Leo stated. "The Dalki are confident creatures, who would attack if they believed they had the strength to do so, but the fact that they are waiting for something is more worrying in my eyes. If you underestimate the enemy, that could be your biggest downfall."

Not shy with his words as always, Leo spoke his mind. He didn’t want the foolish actions of those at the top, affect other lives. He had seen this happen too many times before, and even himself.

Despite Leo saying all of this, Muka couldn’t get out of his mind the first impression he and the other leaders had of the Dalki and thought Leo’s worry was too much.

"I think it is best to inform the king, but I will do so after we figure out just who is behind the missing people. We now have another suspect."

It was at that moment that Paul noticed the painful look that was on Kazz’s face.

"It’s Bryce, isn’t it," Paul said. "I can tell."

Shaking her fist, Kazz not answering straight away was enough confirmation for Muka and Paul that they had found their answer.

"Yes..." Kazz said, but she could say no more.

"What’s he doing with the people? Why is he taking vampires from each of the families." Muka questioned, but it was clear that she wouldn’t say anything else. It had already taken all her will to say yes.

"Kazz, you don’t have to tell us what your father is doing with those missing people." Muka sighed in defeat. "But I will say this. We will be looking to prosecute the king for the crimes he has committed. When the time comes, your testimony, one from his own bloodline and the first leader, will have a big impact on the verdict and the opinion of the other leaders."

Truth be told, when Kazz said yes, she didn’t know what to expect to hear, she had been avoiding the consequences that her father might suffer if his crimes came to light. If the world knew the truth, and knowing what his fate would be, all got a bit too much for her that tears started to roll down her cheeks.

"If...If I agree." Kazz said firmly, making sure they knew she still wasn’t entirely on their side. "And I decide to participate in this, then can you promise me one thing. That my father doesn’t suffer from execution and is instead put into eternal slumber."

"You know that is not for me to decide, but I promise that I will try to persuade the others as well," Muka replied.

After saying that, Kazz felt like she was no longer needed and decided to leave out of the window. Nobody called out to her or said anything else.

"It looks like we might be able to move forwards sooner than we thought. Leave the Dalki problem to me. I shall inform the Royal knights and speak to the other leaders about the best course of action. I think at this moment, no matter what we say, Bryce will somehow twist it so that this was Arthur’s doing." Muka said, and soon he left, but not before turning around and looking at Erin once more.

———

With the others gone, Paul was a lot more interested in finding out about the Dalki that Erin and Leo encountered. So he heard the rest of the details from them.

"I was just about to contact Quinn. I have to tell him about the council’s order, and maybe the Dalki being here means something." Paul said. "What about you two? Will you be staying here? I fear that something bigger might happen, and honestly, it would be great to have someone of your strength by my side."

Leo looked towards Erin. His task was complete. Now even though they were in the vampire settlement and in a castle full of vampires, Erin didn’t seem to have this urge to kill. At least it wasn’t very strong.

"I think you are right," Leo said. "If Quinn is unable to come here, then I think we might be more helpful here than there. However, that is also the reason why we must go. We will be back as soon as possible to help you out."

The reason for Leo saying this was because he wanted to meet up with Alex, so his and Erin’s weapons could be made and then they would return.

"Very well. I will be waiting for your return."

——

At the moment, Quinn could be seen on a green meadow against three Dalki. The first one attacked with a thigh kick, but a shadow was soon raised blocking the attack. Another of the Dalki had thrown a fist towards his head.

The shadow tried to move to the position, but it was too slow, so Quinn instead lifted his arm, blocking the attack to his head, then went and grabbed onto it, piercing its skin with his fingers. Next, using a flash step, he got in close to Dalki’s body, shielding himself from the other two, and punched it directly in the gut.

Green blood spewed from its mouth, and the Dalki were no longer attacking.

"What are you doing?" The Dalki said, bent over.

"I know, sorry, it was just instinct," Quinn replied. To be more precise, the one who had responded at this moment was Vincent, who was in Quinn’s body.

Quinn was able to obtain three Marked once again, currently each of them at the one spike stage. What the two of them were doing now was training for both of them.

Quinn wanted to get more in tune with fighting while using the other two as puppets. In turn, he thought the fighting would allow the Dalki to get stronger as they got injured. However, there was a second part to this training as well, and that was training Vincent.

After being with Vincent, Quinn had come to learn of the struggles he had while in his body, so they thought this would be good training for them both. This way, Vincent could learn how to use the shadow powers more efficiently in a fight, and Quinn could improve the Dalki.

"Hey, I think you’re getting a call!" Vincent shouted.

Hearing this, Quinn no longer was in control of their Dalki and went to his own body. When he saw who the call was coming from, he was pretty surprised.

"Quinn, this is Paul. There’s something I need to tell you...."

# Chapter 1261 - A Punisher's Message
Due to the King’s order, the third castle was currently going through a difficult situation for more reasons than one. Their leader had just been killed, yet they weren’t granted any time to grieve for those who cared for the leader and at the same time, there were vampires from other families taking advantage of the situation.

Disputes between families were quite common, so vampires were a proud bunch. They would often compare the strength of each of the families. Once in a while this competition would go too far, and result in fighting between the two families. If it got too big, the leaders themselves would have to sort it out, but the castle had no such leader at the moment. It was the same reason why the tenth family had been treated the way they had been for so long.

For as long as they lacked a new leader, it would be a vulnerable time for them. Inside the castle, in one of the grand dining halls, the late third leader’s Vampire knights, May and Verth were going through the candidates to succeed her. The woman and man paced back and forth, their foreheads wrinkled deep in thought.

Meanwhile, sitting in the vacant throne meant for the leader, was a young looking woman with long black hair and a doll-like dress, holding a brown bear in her hand. It was a strange sight, because, although she looked very young, it was clear that the one holding the bear should have long been over that age..

"Annie, there’s no helping it, nobody but you can take this position! I know it’s a little early but Suzan has been preparing you to take over for a long time already!" May shouted.

Annie, held onto the bear tightly, and her legs were shaking up and down while also biting her fingernails. It was clear she was afraid.

"You don’t need to do any of the work. We can cover for that, but right now the third family needs someone to step up, so we’ll have order." Verth agreed with his female companion.

"It’s not about being ready or not." Annie eventually replied in a shaky voice. "If I take that place... no, it’s probably true for whoever takes the leader role... I’m afraid that whoever killed Mother will come after me!"

The two vampire knights didn’t expect this, that they would ever need to convince someone to take the leader position. To the normal vampire folk it was a position they could only dream of. Being in charge of an entire family, becoming one of the most respected members of their society.

"If you just need a leader, then why can’t one of you take the seat?!" Annie crossed her arms and pouted.

The two of them gulped when they thought of this, a shiver ran down them as they remembered Suzan’s body on that wall.

"Th-that’s because... b-because we can’t! We’re knights, after all! As her daughter, it’s only right for you to succeed her." May eventually put together an explanation.

However, Annie may have been naive, but she wasn’t stupid. Although it was going against their etiquette, it wasn’t exactly ’taboo’ either. Especially in their current time, when the first family was being led by their former knight Kazz, and the council had even granted Silver special permission to take over as leader if anything was to happen to the thirteenth leader.

It was practically guaranteed that as long as one of them would come forward that due to the circumstances their request to fill in would be granted. Yet, neither one of them wanted to admit it once the idea of them actually taking over was placed.

"I’m scared, I’m scared out of my mind. I know what the right thing to do is, but I just can’t." Annie cried out in defiance.

"And so you should be." A voice said from inside the room, dark shadows surrounding him.

The two knights, the moment they saw who it was, were now shaking more than ever and almost fell to the floor.

"Arthur...’’ May mumbled. The two of them had only seen his figure once before. The Punishers had been abolished by the time they took over, but they were sure of it. This was the same vampire they had seen at Fex’s execution.

Lifting both his hands up, the two knights, still unable to move, were suddenly sucked into a deep dark shadow, vanishing in seconds. Annie, seeing this, had no clue where they had gone, and she didn’t dare move, too afraid that she would follow them if she angered the intruder.

"Let’s keep the two of them out of our conversation, shall we?" Arthur ’suggested’ with a smile as he walked over. His entire body was covered in dark clothing. He wasn’t wearing the blood armour, nor did he carry his trademark sword on his back. Were it not for May calling out his name, Annie might not have even known who he was.

"Annie... you seem too young to have been born when I entered my sleep, but you might have already been born when all the other Punishers left this world. I am now unable to ask your mother these questions, so it falls on you." Arthur proclaimed as he came forward.

’Does that mean he couldn’t torture the information out of my mother?’ Annie wondered, swallowing hard.

Usually leaders had pride, they wouldn’t let fear take over and they would rather die fighting than to submit to the one threatening their death, however there was one exception to this rule, the Punisher who could make them experience unimaginable pain.

"I...I...Will answer whatever you want." Annie quickly conceded, hoping that Arthur would at least give her a quick and respectful death. Suzan might have been too prideful and tried to fight back, but the young woman had no hopes of leaving the place alive now that she had seen who it was, so her best hope was for a quick and hopefully painless end.

"Around five hundred years ago, when the last King took over. Bryce had gone out on an expedition with a few of the vampire leaders. Do you know about this?"

Annie nodded.

"Great, I’m going to name a few of the old leaders and current leaders and I want you to tell me which of the leaders went on that expedition with Bryce."

Arthur soon went over the list of names starting with the leaders before naming Vampire knights and those in the Royal guard as well. Annie nodded to those that had gone with, and shook her head to those that hadn’t. Arthur didn’t expect her to know the names of all the vampires, but one would have at least known the leaders who had left at the time.

"Thank you for cooperating so far. Now, as for the last name... Annie Topper." Arthur looked up from the list, staring at her with a hint of bloodlust.

The tears were falling uncontrollably down her face, for a brief moment she considered lying, but the glaring eyes gave her the feeling that they would be able to see through it. Even more afraid of the consequences of angering the monster before her, she finally nodded.

"Thank you, for telling me the truth. I doubt you had much say on the matter, but you still need to be punished for your crimes. You’re guilty of eliminating the Punishers and their families who only wanted to live a life away from the settlement." Arthur stated.

When Annie heard Arthur speak, surprisingly his voice was soft and she could tell that he was almost in pain. As if it was something he didn’t want to do, but knew it was something he had to do.

When she heard Arthur talking about the Punishers, her mind went back to that expedition. Although it was true that she did take part, at the time she had merely followed alongside her mother, barely helping her. Still, that was no excuse for the lives she did take that day.

"For your cooperation, you’ve earned a quick end." Arthur proclaimed next to her ear, already having shoved his hand through her heart, with it no longer beating.

’Now I have a list of who to go for, and every single one of these will receive a punishment, but I will savour the ones that are most guilty.’ Arthur thought walking off, a lifeless body slumped behind him on the throne.

This time, it took a little while longer for the body to be discovered. For that day, two Vampire knights, as well as the replacement leader had gone missing. It wasn’t until the vampires on cleaning duty had entered the castle that they spotted the massacre that had occurred and immediately called for the others.

The room had been left untouched. Entering the room before any of the others was King Bryce, followed by Tempus at his side. Looking at the scene, Bryce’s blood was boiling with anger.

"This is my vampire settlement, and during my time, he is doing this. If this continues then the whole vampire settlement could be doomed! I will skewer him, twist his body and drain the blood out from his bones!" Bryce shouted in anger, turning around and breaking the door as he pushed it open.

"Flashy." Tempus noted, looking at the broken door and then turning his attention back to the room in front of him. Looking at the wall behind the throne, a bloody message had been left behind.

"I have a list of you all! Admit what was done to the people or all of them will be punished!"

# Chapter 1262 - The Real Killer?
Once more, an emergency council meeting was abruptly called between the leaders, barely any time had passed since the last. Even stranger was the fact that it had been called in the third castle. Causing some of the leaders to question its importance. Some were complaining thinking that the castle had come into some sort of disagreement as to who to select as their new leader, and now they were to cast a vote.

When the leaders arrived, they thought that they would head to the throne room, but instead they were led to one of the many dining rooms. The situation was getting odder by the second and when they saw several Royal guards standing outside it didn’t exactly clear things up for them.

Muka had just arrived and when he entered, he found the other leaders already discussing things amongst themselves. Apart from Paul, who stood off on his own to the side, looking at the situation.

’What in the...’ Muka was staring at the blood message on the wall, and Annie’s body which had at one point fallen to the floor, with nobody having bothered to pick her up. It might have been the first time in vampire history that the third family had suffered so much in such a short time frame.

"The King apologises for being unable to attend this meeting.." Royal Knight Kyle announced. "However, His Majesty has tasked me to deliver a message on his behalf based on what you see around you."

"The message is as follows: ’If any of you have doubted it, see for yourself what the Punisher has done. He has taken yet another life right from underneath our noses. His message on the wall is a clear sign that he wishes to challenge us all, a promise that he will be coming for us all. Not only us, but our children as well. Only he knows how far he will go. We have to put a stop to him now or he will attempt to get rid of every vampire in the settlement!’ "

The majority of those attending clearly agreed with that statement. Annie hadn’t even been officially made the third leader, yet she had met such a cruel end. However, not all of them were shocked and in fear as they tried to figure out just what was going on.

’If this really is Arthur’s doing, why did he target the third family twice?’ Muka wondered. ’Could there really be something Annie knew that Suzan didn’t? No, that should be impossible. She was practically a shut-in. Still, this time he left us a message, telling us about him having a list... did he intend to start with all those from the third family and move on from there?’

It wasn’t really a meeting, the leaders were talking with each other freely, but with no real agenda set up and the King absent, the other leaders eventually left the place not long after the Royal knights had excused themselves.

Some walking more in a hurry than others.

However, a few of the leaders had decided to stay to take a closer look at the murder scene. Aside from Muka there was Sunny, and Jin. Similar to last time, the room had no signs of struggles or fighting in it. There was the broken door, but it looked as if the guards were already in the middle of repairing it, while having left the rest of the scene untouched. Making Muka think it was someone else’s doing. It looked like apart from the message their only clue was the dead body.

"Does anyone else find it strange?" Sunny asked. "The way Suzan was killed by Arthur? When we look at Suzan’s death it was a clear fear tactic statement, and you could say this is the same again, but the message here, it was clearly left behind for us, while the first had been for the public to see."

"Does that really matter?" Jin questioned, unable to see Sunny’s point. "Perhaps Arthur had hoped for a certain outcome after Suzan’s death, but with us not reacting how he wanted, this time he left behind a clearer message?"

Jin walked up to the wall and looked over the message as if hoping it would reveal some sort of secret underneath. "Or whoever these people are that he has annoyed. This list of his, and the words after. I’m sure you have noticed it, some of the other leaders are afraid, more shaken up by this than us and frightened. Surely, they know something that we don’t. Maybe Arthur wants them to tell the whole settlement what they did."

Sunny stood up and walked up to the blood message on the wall standing by Jin’s side.

"I think we all knew that from the beginning. Have you ever thought about how Bryce managed to get so many votes for himself? The ones frightened were the same ones who he had wrapped around his finger since day one." Sunny pointed out, while she started to sniff the wall. Her nose was far more sensitive than her companions.

"You’re missing my point. Look at the bodies as well. This time, it was a single strike through the heart, a rather painless death. Now think back to how Suzan was killed. Only one of those completely disrespects the deceased’s body. To top things off, the blood on this wall smells slightly different from Annie’s blood."

He understood that things were strange, otherwise Jin wouldn’t have stayed behind in the first place to see if there was anything he could find, but he thought that Sunny was perhaps trying to grasp at straws too much.

When dealing with murder and revenge, people couldn’t really be expected to stay reasonable with their actions or thoughts.

"No, you’re not the only one that thinks Suzan’s death was out of the ordinary." Muka stated, answering her first question.

"This blood..." Sunny murmured to herself, closing her eyes so her senses were better. "I have never smelt blood quite like what’s on the wall, but there is one thing I’m sure about, it’s not Annie’s. If that’s the case, then maybe this message was written in Arthur’s own blood."

"I sense pain, through his actions, someone who doesn’t even like what he is doing. However, the first body was different. You’re right, Jin, perhaps they are the same actions of the same person, but if that is so, then the person would be in two different states of mind."

———

At the tenth castle, before the meeting had been called for the vampire’s leaders to attend again, Paul was busy sending off both Erin and Leo. The teleporter needed to be activated by him, only once getting in touch with Logan.

Then when turned on at the other end, they could go through safely.

"I hope you are able to contain the chaos so there won’t be too much for us to do when we come back. I’m getting old." Leo said with a smile.

"You may be blind but you should at least know that I am the same age as you. Besides, what does age matter to us now?" Paul joked, both aware that their bodies felt stronger than they had done even back in their prime.

———

After stepping through the teleporter, Erin and Leo found themselves in the familiar metal and white room. They both knew that they were finally back on the Cursed ship. It felt like it had been an exceptionally long time, for Erin at least.

’Every time I leave this place, I think it’s only going to be for a short while, but it always ends up being longer.’ Erin realised with a slight grimace.

As for the one to greet them on the other side, it was none other than Sam. He knew how much the two meant to Quinn, so he couldn’t just send anyone to see how they were doing.

"I’m glad to find both of you in great health. Honestly, I was half expecting one of you to come back with a missing arm or leg of some sort. Paul told me that you would eventually return to the Vampire World."

"Unfortunately, Quinn isn’t here at the moment, but the rest of the gang is. It would be nice if you both stopped by and talked to them. I’m sure you have a lot to chat about. I guess you haven’t seen the video either."

"What video?" Erin asked, confused. The video Sam was talking about, was the one that nearly everyone had seen. Of course, in the middle of the woods fighting, Leo and Erin had no clue what Quinn and the others had been through during their time away.

"I guess we do have a lot of catching up to do. What brings you here anyway?" Sam asked.

"Weapons." Leo answered. "We were hoping to meet up with Alex and get him to forge a few new weapons for us. Ours might be a little dull for what we are about to face."

Hearing this, Sam had the biggest grin possible on his face.

"Well, I was going to save this for later, but Quinn did leave me something in case you would return. I’m sure you will greatly appreciate his ’little’ gift."

# Chapter 1263 - A Gift From Quinn
Erin and Leo were very interested in finding out what had exactly happened while they had been away. Walking alongside Sam around the Cursed ship they noticed that there were many changes here and there. Certain parts had been remodeled, different areas had been strengthened and more security systems had been implemented.

'Did the Cursed ship suffer from an attack while we were away?' Leo thought. 'I guess that much should be expected with the human race at war again. Have they gone out to help out other planets?'

"I'm sorry, Sam." Erin apologised, after noticing through her ability that there were far less people on the Cursed ship than the last time they had been there. "It looks like you guys have been attacked during our absence. If we had been here, probably less lives would have been lost. Just what happened that there are so few people left?"

It took a second for Sam to figure out what Erin meant by this, but then he remembered that he had yet to fill them in.

"We have lost a lot of lives, but not as many as you seem to believe…" Sam replied. "The actual reason why there aren't that many on the Cursed ship right now is because many chose to leave the ship."

"After we were attacked, our Cursed faction temporarily made the Earthborn group's Shelter on planet Caladi into our base. Although the Cursed ship is back and running again, many decided to stay there for the time being."

"As I said, a lot happened while you guys were away, but we pulled through. I'm sure the two of you were busy doing your own important thing as well. Heck, we even heard that we have you to thank for defeating a four spiked Dalki on Earth!"

The duo thought they had been quite careful at the time, but a blind swordsman wasn't exactly a common occurrence, making him easy for many to remember. With Pure seemingly having erased all of their traces the public believed that Leo was the one to have finished the enemy on his own.

Finally, the trio had reached Quinn's private training room where the surprise had been left for Leo and Erin. Even before they entered the room, through the Glathrium door the two of them could feel the intense energy inside, and the hallway feeling a little cooler. The closer they got to the door the cooler the air felt.

For Erin though, it was simultaneously a familiar and foreign feeling. Someone who had ice abilities was used to this chill, but it didn't quite feel the same as an ability. After Sam put in the code the door slid open, and the two of them could clearly see what was in front of them.

"Leo, do you see that…it's the…'' Erin was unable to speak normally as she naturally walked forward, drawn to the weapon.

"For even my own student to forget that I lack sight." Leo shook his head. "I do feel it though. There is no other weapon that I have ever felt that comes close to it. This has to be a Demon tier weapon."

Leo and Erin had not been present when Oscar had shown the Demon tier weapon to everyone, so this was the first time the two were in its presence. Being near a Demon beast item or weapon for the first time certainly had an effect on everyone.

Its raw energy was calling out to the both of them, for them to pick it up and use it immediately.

"It looks like you like the gift Quinn left you then." Sam smiled from behind them.

"This is the gift Quinn left for Leo? Just what happened for something like this to end up in the Cursed faction's hand? Why doesn't he want to use it for himself? Isn't this too much?" Erin was shocked that Quinn wouldn't use such a thing for himself, yet she couldn't keep her eyes off the weapon.

"As I said, a lot has happened while you guys were away. Quinn actually has his own Demon tier item. To fully utilise the power of this one he would have to incorporate it into his set of skills."

"However, Quinn has gained another special sword that he claims suits his fighting style far more than this one. Additionally, he doesn't think that it's a good idea for all our fighting power to be focused on just one person.

"With the war going on, and the enemy turning out to be far stronger than we could have imagined, it seemed wiser to give the weapon to someone better suited and who could be better suited to use a Demon tier Sword than a swordsman?"

Walking up to the sword, Leo stared at it, sensing its powers. He certainly did have an interest in obtaining a stronger weapon. That was his goal of coming back here, after all, but Leo wasn't used to receiving gifts as big as this from others. He had always obtained things himself, the fact that it came from a student he used to teach, didn't make it any less strange.

"This is no small surprise." Leo grabbed the hilt of the sword, and he could feel his whole body run with a cold shiver. He lifted it up with a single hand, with complete ease. It looked strange from the outside since the sword was three quarters the size of his body.

Giving it a test, he started to swing it in separate movements. First a step forward slicing it in an arc shape. Next from below, almost skimming the bottom of the ground, and finally from over his head stopping before the large blade would hit the ground.

To both Erin and Sam who were watching, just these three simple strikes looked incredibly impressive.

'Even with a large weapon like this, he can control the flow of the sword so it doesn't feel unnatural. He is a master of all swords, not just the katana blade.' Erin thought as she watched him, a slight feeling of envy rose inside of her.

"This weapon…" Leo said slowly, looking at it once more, giving it another swing to make sure. "It does not suit me. Neither the size nor shape fit my personal fighting style."

"However, I agree with what Quinn said and his reasoning for wishing to give me the blade. I assume since he gifted it to me, it's mine to do with what I want, correct?"

At first, Sam couldn't believe what he was hearing. Was Leo really going to reject the Demon tier Sword? Even if it wasn't what he was used to, the extra power from it alone would increase his strength, or he could switch between weapons, but after his question, Sam understood what he was planning.

"Of course." Sam smiled. "You know what Quinn is like and I'm sure he will be happy with the decision you are making."

It was then that Leo started to walk over to Erin.

"You needed Two blades, remember? I remember one of the blades you used to have was similar to this one. With this weapon, I'm sure you'll not just be able to revive your family's swordsmanship, but bring it to new heights."

With this Leo handed over the weapon and Erin held it firmly in her hands. The cold feeling enveloped her entire body but it was nothing that she couldn't handle. She found herself naturally grasping the handle with both of her hands, and before even saying anything, she immediately gave it a few swings.

When swinging it in a crescent shape, she allowed the blade to slightly take control, lifting her feet off the ground, going straight into the next movement. Her body was now a good meter and a half in the air, and striking down again, she spun her whole body a full spin, until finally landing on the ground and completing a final sweep strike on the floor.

Seeing this, Sam was equally impressed with her sword skills, even though he was no swordsman. Being a vampire he was able to track her movements very carefully and he had seen his fair share of fights. He could tell that the movements were just as fluid as the ones that Leo had produced.

'Indeed, seeing her just swing the Demon tier Sword around, nobody will be able to complain about her having it.' Sam thought.

It was then that Erin snapped out of her daze. She wasn't meant to accept the sword in the first place, but her body had taken over the moment she held it.

"I can't. Leo, this was your gift from Quinn. You need a weapon and it will be far better in your hands." Erin said, bowing down and holding the sword out for Leo to take.

"Yes and I believe I just said that since it's my gift I can do what I want with it. Remember, I still have a gift from that fellow from before. I'm certain that Alex will be able to make a fine weapon out of it, one that he can customise for my use." Leo stated.

"While I appreciate your sentiment, do you honestly believe a weapon that utilises ice powers of all things would be better in my hands? I'm sure that you felt it yourself when using that sword, so you should know that answer."

"The moment you took it, I felt its power spike up, something that didn't happen when I took it. I would say, even if you didn't want it, that blade has chosen you. Combine it with the skills you've learned, and continue to improve the skills of the current you."

In all honesty, Erin was happy that Leo didn't want the sword back, she had just felt like she had been undeserving of it. She hadn't achieved any great feat nor fought against a mighty foe and yet here she was receiving one of the strongest weapons in the world, but she had felt it. Just like what Leo had claimed, the moment she had touched it, it had felt so familiar to her.

Perhaps it was because of her lost ice powers, and the purpose of the weapon. Nonetheless now it was hers to keep.

"Thank you, Leo. Thank you Sam." Erin bowed to them both. "I promise to prove to everyone that I deserve to use this weapon."

"Haha, no need to thank me. I'm just the messenger boy, if you want to thank somebody besides Leo, thank Quinn the next time you see him."

Having improved in her strength by leaps and strides she was just wondering how much stronger she had gotten. With the Demon tier Sword in her hands, she couldn't help but consider herself becoming almighty, but that also made her think of one other thing.

'That women, the prophecy…is it really okay for me to have so much power? What happens, if what she said is true? What happens if at some point I…' Gripping the sword tightly, she shook her head. 'No, I've never believed in any of that crap and I won't start now. I won't let it happen!'

# Chapter 1264 - Black Flames
After obtaining the Demon tier weapon, Sam suggested for Erin to wrap it up for the time being to keep it away from the eye of the others. He had prepared a basic blue coloured cloth which was placed on Erin’s back, but she planned to ask Alex to make a special sheathe, so they could better hide the strong energy radiating from it.

Before meeting with the forger though, Leo and Erin were both interested to hear just what exactly had happened to this place, since Sam had been vague so far.

"I don’t plan to keep silent about this matter, I just thought it would be easier for you to see for yourself." Sam explained. "Luckily for you guys, nearly the whole thing was caught on tape."

Heading to the command centre, on the way they stopped by Logan’s office. There wasn’t much for them to talk about, but Leo gave a few words of encouragement like a teacher would to their students, while Erin couldn’t stop staring at the robotic arm underneath, until she eventually spoke up.

"At least you didn’t have to get turned into a vampire. You’ve always been a bit different and unique, this just makes it more so."..

Logan thought about her statement for a moment. It hadn’t really bothered him that much, but he guessed she had a point.

"Thank you." Logan simply replied.

An awkward encounter to say the least, from two students who had never really talked to one another. Next they headed to the command centre. Using the big screen, Sam showed them everything, starting from when Quinn and the others had been attacked by Innu. At times he informed them about certain things not caught on tape.

Of course, they already knew some of what was going on, even when they had been tracking down Pure they had kept up to date with things, but Sam wanted to give them the necessary context they might need. After all, they knew nothing about Supreme Commander Oscar’s demise, the new member Shiro, the invasion of the Dalki and many other things.

At the end of it, Erin almost felt tired just listening to the story, as she imagined herself being in each of the situations they had been through.

"They....they went through all of that." Erin murmured to herself, her mouth left wide open. Now she felt even less deserving of the weapon on her back. Her earlier proclamation of wanting to prove that she deserved to wield the blade suddenly felt a whole lot heavier.

Looking over the two, Sam could tell that they were deep in thought, perhaps feeling guilty that they had been absent at such a crucial time.

"Look guys, nobody blames you. All of us know that you were doing something important and you wouldn’t just have left without good reason." Sam said. "Nobody knows what would have happened if you were here and we can’t change the past, so there’s no point mulling over it."

"I didn’t show you everything so the two of you would feel guilty or so that you would stay here rather than return to the Vampire World. Honestly, in my opinion it would be better for you to go back. After Quinn received the news of what was happening, he was even debating whether to outright ignore the order from the council and get involved."

"With both of you there, I think it would give him a little piece of mind."

Hearing this was definitely the type of encouragement they both needed. Even Leo, although wise in his age and experience, had never quite been faced with such a situation like they were currently in. He had his own agenda with Pure, his responsibilities as a Vampire knight, a leader of the Cursed faction and his student Erin all to balance carefully.

"Thank you Sam, if it weren’t for the many reliable people the Cursed faction has managed to gather I don’t think I would be able to achieve as much as I have done so far."

——

With that, it was finally time for the two of them to head to the forgery room to accomplish their original reason for coming back to the Cursed faction.

As always the sound of clanging was heard as they were approaching, and when the doors opened, they were expecting to see Alex hammering away with his other assistants on board, but the two of them were in for another shock.

As expected they could see Alex, hammering away freely with his wings out, but next to him....

’Did Quinn create another Blood fairy?’ Erin wondered. ’No, is he maybe another subclass? An evolution perhaps?’

The surprises didn’t seem to stop. She had never seen the giant guy next to Alex before, and she was remembering the troubles the Cursed faction had gone through in the Vampire world just having one Blood fairy.

There was no need for the two to announce that they had entered the room, for straight away, Andrew looked up and stared directly at Erin.

"My word, I never thought I would see it back here again, yet here it is." The large man spoke, as he lifted up his forging mask, and put his hammer down. His giant red wings started to flap about fast with excitement walking towards Erin.

’What is going on? Why is he coming towards me?’ Unable to make heads or tails of the situation, Erin went to grab the weapon, but before she reached it. Alex noticed that Andrew had stopped his work. Looking over he saw Erin’s actions.

"Hey, relax, both of you, we’re all on the same side!" Alex exclaimed nervously, worried his wings could be sliced off at any second. The few times he had talked and dealt with Erin, she hadn’t exactly been the patient type of person.

With both sides having calmed down, Alex introduced the returning duo the giant forger and told them that Andrew was the one who had worked on the Demon tier weapon that Erin currently wielded. After learning of this fact, her whole demeanor completely changed.

"Thank you so much for creating such a masterpiece." Erin bowed down, several times. "This weapon, the balance, everything about it is perfect for my use."

This was something that Alex would have never imagined the old Erin doing, she had certainly changed a lot since the last time he had seen her.

"Haha." Andrew started laughing, not really being offended by Erin’s prior actions at all. He was just happy to see the weapon again."Originally I created it for a man the same size as me, so I find it a little strange you saying that the weapon is a perfect fit for yourself."

"Go on then, what do you want us to make?" Alex smiled, knowing full well that the only time people came down here was when they wanted someone to make a weapon for him. Perhaps some would feel a bit sad at this, but making weapons was Alex’s favourite thing to do, and the fact that people trusted him so much these days to personally make a weapon for them, was a blessing that he had never thought he would be able to achieve in the past.

"I have obtained a Demi-god tier crystal, but it is only one. I hope it will be enough to create a katana-like blade. You can use mine for reference." Leo stated his request, taking his off, and handing it over to Alex. The second Alex touched it though, he immediately dropped it to the floor.

"Sorry, it must have been my butter fingers." Alex said, knowing this wasn’t true, as a forger he had strong fingers, and when he went to pick it up again, he dropped it almost immediately as a strange feeling could be felt when holding the sword.

’No wonder this forger is special, even he can feel that it’s cursed.’ Leo thought.

Finally, on a third attempt, Alex picked it up with both hands firmly.

"Tell me, this sword is important to you, correct? You have only brought me one Demi-god tier crystal so I don’t know if it will be enough to create you a weapon of the calliper that is needed, but recently I came across an upgrade crystal and with it I found out a few new techniques. If you are willing to test it out. I could try to use the Demi-god tier crystal to upgrade your current weapon instead.

"No sorry that would be wrong, it would be a new weapon, using the current sword to give the Demi-god tier weapon a boost."

Hearing this, Leo thought it was a great opportunity. Honestly he didn’t want to stop using his current weapon, for it carried the will of his former companions with him, but if the weapon could be used, would the Cursed effect move on to the new weapon.

"What are the chances of success?" Leo asked.

"Fifty percent. Well that’s not completely correct. It’s guaranteed that it will be a Demi-god tier blade, although it might be on the low end and closer to a Legendary tier weapon, but if it works..."

"Please, I will put my trust in you." Leo interrupted him.

After that, the two made two more requests for a blood weapon to be made from the many blood crystals that Erin had gathered. For the blood weapon the best crystals were selected while the others were given to Alex to keep and use how he wished.

Meanwhile, Andrew would be making a special sheath to cover the Demon tier Sword’s energy. A task he was most pleased to do.

Of course the weapons would take a while to make, so both Erin and Leo were left on the ship for a while, and for the first time they could eventually rest. In doing so, and with nothing to do, Erin decided that there was someone that she needed to visit who she hadn’t done in a long time.

While heading to the canteen, the two of them finally met again.

"Layla!" Erin called out.

"Erin," Layla called out back, dropping her plate of food out of surprise, but Erin caught it before it could touch the floor.

Leo, who was with them to grab some food, noticed something with his ability almost straight away, that by Layla’s waist she had a sword.

"Hey, When did you get a new sword? I knew you had the old one but you hardly used it." Erin asked.

Looking at the energy surrounding the sword, something was incredibly off about it. Usually beast weapons gave off a red colour which Leo could perceive through his ability, the same as beasts themselves. In the same vein, vampires gave off a purple energy, so what was up with this weapon that looked to have black flames spiralling from it.

*****

# Chapter 1265 - Quick Growth
After each of them grabbed something to eat, they decided to sit down together to talk a bit more. Erin acutely didn’t have to consume blood and could eat a regular diet similar to humans; this was the same for Layla. However, Leo had just grabbed one of the juice boxes with a small amount of blood inside.

Drinking such an amount of blood no longer troubled him when trying to control himself since he was so in tune with his senses, but if a vampire were to deprive themselves of blood entirely for too long, they would feel tired and a little weak.

As for the reason Leo decided to sit beside them, was because he wanted to find out a little more about the sword. He was sure that Layla didn’t know how unique it was and would bring it up to her once he found out more.

The two of them got to talking and how exactly a particular sword had gotten into her hands. Even though the match against Burnie was televised, the whole saga of what happened with the second Pure leader was not.

"I’m sorry Layla," Erin said. "If I was there, maybe I could have helped out more, but it sounds like you turned into quite the fighter. You managed to unlock the fourth form and summon all of that Qi?".

She wasn’t used to getting compliments, so Layla’s face was appearing a little redder.

"I mean, I can’t really summon my fourth form at will, and my body is too weak to handle the Qi in my body without it. If I summon all of the Qi in my body, it hurts, and besides, the Qi in my body is not even mine in the first place. It’s my mothers."

Honestly, both Leo and Erin were a little disheartened after hearing Layla’s story. They had gone searching for high ranking members of Pure and never ran into them, and yet, Layla did and had to go through such a troubling experience without them there.

It was clear that what happened with Agent 2 was a sensitive subject. When Layla explained what he had said about her mother, she had choked up a few times.

"Your achievements are still your achievements." Leo finally spoke. "The weapons we use to aid us, the Qi that we use, is an energy that is borrowed from the outside, and the food we eat helps us to grow. Without our parents, we would have never been born in the first place. All of these things could be considered help from other forces.

"So don’t downplay what you did. Even if someone had the same Qi as you, they wouldn’t have been able to control it as well. If one thing, me and Erin can sense the strong Qi in your body, and for you to handle it so well, is a feat in itself."

Thinking about things like this, Layla was a little happier. She had spent some time with both Leo and Erin before they had left, and it was good to have them back again.

"Leo, I know you wanted to know some stuff about Pure. I don’t know how much you found out, but an agent is on board the Cursed ship as a captive. With the influence skill, we were unable to get things out of him, but if you like, you two could try as well." Layla said.

The two were thankful to find this out. Leo had found out the information he needed to find out he was on the right track. Now all he needed to do was find out where Pure was, or more importantly, where Agent 0 was.

"Thank you," Erin replied. "About your sword, I guess since you discovered the fourth form, you’ve been practising a little bit more with it. Why don’t the two of us have a little spar? We can show each other a few things."

Immediately, Layla started to shake her hands.

"Erin, what could you learn from me? I am far weaker than you. It would be no contest."

"Stop being so humble. It’s okay to brag once in a while." A voice from behind said, soon pulling one of the chairs back, and he sat down with the others. The one that had arrived was Nate, who had brought a slab of raw-looking meat with him on his plate.

Nate was concerned about his body since he used it to train in martial arts. He made sure he always got the right amount of protein in, but he wasn’t sure if it mattered anymore now, he was a vampire. Still, the only thing that he could still taste and not throw up was lightly cooked meat which in a way was perfect for him.

"I know how strong you are." Nate continued to say. "In that video, a lot of people give me credit for being the main person to defeat Burnie, but that’s not true at all, and you know it. You managed to transfer your Qi into me, and without that sword of yours, those flames would have hurt even more. Remember, he was one of the big four, so if you call yourself weak, you are also calling him weak. And well, me who couldn’t even beat him without your help even weaker.

"On top of that, you nearly beat Helen, the leader of Daisy in a one on one duel, and that was before you knew how to use your crazy powers and was just starting to learn how to use Qi a little better."

Those on the ship were used to Nate exaggerating a little bit, but at the moment, he really wasn’t. Listening to what they said, Leo paid closer attention to the video they had watched not too long ago. In particular, he was thinking back to the fight they had seen with Burnie.

’Was Layla really able to transfer Qi to another and form a distance? It makes sense what Nate is saying then and adds up in the video. Is it possible that she was also able to combine Qi with her ability? If that is true, then what she has is even better than the third stage of Qi. She could power items from a distance and others. This is an incredible ability and power to have.’ Leo imagined just how he would use such an ability and the many ways one could utilise it.

Layla was perhaps unaware of how valuable such a thing was, and if he could push her in the right direction, she would become a strong force on the Cursed faction team.

"I think it would be a good experience for the two of you to fight each other. Leo eventually said after gathering his thoughts. "It sounds like there are many things the two of you can learn from each other. Also, I would like to see the passive skill of the sword in action. The one that was capable of blocking even the fire powers of one of the great four."

———

Reluctantly, Layla eventually agreed to the request, and they were in one of the many training rooms on the Cursed ship. She always found it hard to say no to people, and it was even worse when an elder like Leo asked her. Nate had also decided to come along since he was interested in seeing the match between them.

"Layla, before the match starts, I want you to use everything you have," Erin said, as she placed the cloth wrapped sword down on the floor away from where the two were about to do battle. Using a Demon tier weapon she didn’t know how to use would be dangerous. On top of that, Erin didn’t really think it was fair. "That fourth form you spoke about, you said you can’t freely bring it out, but I want you to try."

Nate was smiling in excitement. He knew Erin was strong before but thought they probably had no idea how strong Layla had gotten, and the two of them would be in for a surprise. They drew their weapons. Erin’s shaped like a katana sword, while Layla’s was more similar to a standard longsword.

The fight had begun, and Erin was the first to strike, giving out a quick slash from a distance, striking out a line of red aura. Seeing this, Layla stayed calm. The sword had done her well so far.

’This sword can even block the energy of Qi, so it should be the same for the vampire aura as well!’ Layla thought as she struck the red aura, making it disappear as the sword hit it. As expected, the blade had negated even the vampire aura.

Erin was a bit lost at what to do next. She had combined her Qi with the red blood aura to create quite a strong attack, similar to what Quinn and Leo did. She was hoping, based on how much Layla would have struggled with the attack, she would have adjusted how the two of them would fight from there, but the way the black sword had gone through the red aura was effortless.

Now knowing her sword worked well, Layla decided to go on the attack instead. She pulled out her bow from her back and fired three Qi filled arrows towards her opponent, and started to control the direction they were going, but that wasn’t the only thing Layla had done.

Controlling the three arrows with one hand, she charged forward with the blade in the other.

With the first arrow, Erin’s sword struck against its head straight on, and to her surprise, there was resistance until eventually, she was able to cut it in half.

’Is this the strong Qi in her body? My body has improved. I know my strength, and my Qi is strong, yet I still couldn’t cut her arrows cleanly.’ Erin thought. ’Layla, you really have gotten a lot better.’

"Hahaha, and you guys haven’t even seen her transform yet," Nate said out loud like some type of cheerleader for her.

"Both of their growth is impressive. Perhaps before we leave this ship, the two of them can complete that," Leo said.

"That?" Nate asked, not sure what ’that’ was referring to.

"There is still a way the two of them can improve their strength quickly in a desperate situation. If we can, I would like for Erin and Layla to unlock their soul weapon before we leave."

*****

# Chapter 1266 - Dragon Eyes
The fight between the two young women continued. Layla mainly used her arrows as a type of distraction while also throwing out her black balls that when hit would summon the Spiritual chains trapping her for a few seconds, but since Erin knew what they did she was able to avoid them easily.

Surprisingly, Layla had become the aggressor in their training fight, Erin had remained on the defensive attacking her with a few simple Blood swipes and with her sword now and again. However, those attacks proved to be ineffective in front of the black sword.

Despite the speed the attacks were coming out towards her at, Layla had enough control to power her body with Qi, allowing her arms to move at a faster speed, if she were to attack with sword itself though she didn’t have much options. Afraid that in her regular form, she would be outmatched in strength in a head on clash.

The downside of the black sword was that it negated anything it came into contact with, including Layla’s Qi, if she tried to empower it or her own Telekinesis ability on the blade itself as well. Without transforming, the only thing she could do was use her arrows to attack.

"Erin has become far more patient." Leo noted from the side. "After realising her first attack had been negated, she is now testing out the limits of Layla’s capabilities.."

Leo was commenting on the fight, pointing out the good points and bad points of both sides. Nate, who was standing by his side, was wondering just who the words were exactly meant for, but his thoughts were also on something else. Since he could just listen to the analysis of the fight thanks to the Blind Swordsman, Nate kept staring at Leo’s eyes.

’Is he really blind? His pupils are white and everything, but then how is he able to tell so clearly what’s going on in the fight? Well, that much he might have been able to feel, but just how the hell did he manage to watch the video of us fighting then?’ Nate wondered, but he didn’t consider it proper to ask the other.

There were only a few people that had experienced the vision that Leo could see through his ability. That being Erin who had the same ability and Vorden when he had once borrowed it. The ability that both Leo and Erin shared was called Dragon Eyes.

It allowed the ones who had this ability to see everything in a wireframe like view. Leo could actually see the people in front of him, the room around them and if a leaf were to fall down he could see that too, only from his perspective it would look like a small object made up of small white lines.

What this also meant, was that Leo was actually able to see through objects and walls and what was over on the other side. However, he was unable to see the natural colour of things.

The amazing thing about this type of view was that it allowed him to differentiate between different types of life energy by their respective colours. He could see this energy in such detail that it would often move before the person themselves moved as well.

However, these colours that represented different energies when using his ability were different to when he was sensing them using his Qi. For example, Dragon Eyes showed vampires as a mass of purple energy, humans as a yellow energy, and beast as a red type of energy.

But if Leo was to use his Qi to sense energy, the vampire internal energy would appear red. Because of how his ability worked, Leo was able to watch the videos on the screen just fine, it just looked different to how others would perceive it.

He was unable to tell from the first glance who was who on the screen and had to guess from the wireframe shapes. Also due to it being a video, he couldn’t sense the energy coming off them, but thanks to the commentary and Erin by his side, he had managed to figure out certain details along the way.

The fight was starting to heat up, as Layla had transformed into their second form, where she now had the speed and strength of a regular vampire and with her added Qi she would be even stronger.

’This body can handle a bit more of the Qi that’s in my body, but not as much as the fourth form, and I can’t use the abilities of any of the other forms, but this will have to do!" Layla thought charging in, but suddenly before she could even swing her sword in a full motion, Erin went on the offensive.

The suppression chains came off and she swung them out, wrapping around Layla’s arms to the side.

"The first form." Leo commented, recognising the movements.

The suppression chains when wrapped around Layla’s arms also made her feel slightly weaker and with Erin’s strength, she was able to yank her arm away, pulling her sword and strike to the side, so it had hit nothing but the floor.

Straight after, Erin was already directly in front of her, and the Dhampir thrusted her sword forward directly into the other’s stomach. At the last second, she turned the sword so only the guard of the sword had hit her, and Layla was sent flying back with the chains released.

’Now for the second form!’ Erin thought, as she pulled her chains back.

"That’s enough!" Leo declared the end of this fight.

Hearing that, Erin took a second to look over Layla’s condition. The other still hadn’t recovered from the attack.

"Layla, I asked you to fight me at your full strength. Where was your fourth form?" Erin questioned, disappointed. She had been looking forward to testing out the new swordsmanship style she had created against someone other than Leo, but after the first form, Layla seemed unable to fight for a while.

After recovering a little bit Layla finally answered, fidgeting a bit towards the end. "I tried, but the first time it happened I... I ended up losing control. I just haven’t been able to transform into that again... ever since. Not even back then during the fight... even though we could have really used it..."

Walking over, Erin gave her hand out and lifted her friend off the ground.

"You... are you afraid of using it? Trust me, I understand. The whole reason why me and Leo needed to leave this place was because I needed to find a way to control myself. Thanks to Leo I managed to do it and if I can manage to suppress my condition, I just know you’ll be able to as well. I’ll look forward to the time the two of us can fight again."

In all honesty, it had been the fact that Layla had been so impressive at the beginning of their fight that Erin had believed that there was more to come. For this reason, she had gotten swayed up in the flow of the fight, and when she had seen Layla’s second form and her opponent holding the sword like that, it had been her chance to act.

Nate couldn’t quite believe it. He had only seen one of the forms, but was trying to imagine what he would have done differently to deal with the situation. His fighting sense was far better than Layla’s but he could tell that a lot of thought was put into linking an attack with the chains and sword after.

’The best thing to do is to avoid the chains, I wonder what the second form would have looked like?’

"Excellent." Leo walked over, clapping his hands to congratulate the progress of the two of them. "Layla, I was able to see the Qi you added to those arrows. Not only did you supply them with Qi when you were touching them, but you managed to also supply more to them after they had left your bow. I think there is great room for improvement for both of you."

"I’ve decided that while me and Erin are waiting for our weapons, I will personally train the both of you. For the next week we will focus on you two learning what your soul weapons are."

——

In the Cursed faction, Layla hadn’t been the only one that had been mulling over her weakness. For there was one other that had felt like he hadn’t been that much help during the Blade family’s attack.

In the research room, Logan was currently working away from the other, creating another anti jammer device to be sent to another one of the planets.

The Cursed faction’s planets had been the priority, but now they had also been requested to help the Graylash group as well as the Earthborn group as well.

"You don’t understand, Logan! He just slapped me! It was a single slap and because of his stupid ability I was unable to retaliate! I didn’t even manage to get so much as a single punch in! A freaking slap!" Peter shouted, getting more and more annoyed at himself as he remembered his ’fight’ with Hilston.

Pausing his work, Logan looked over. One of the reasons he and Peter had been getting along so well, had been that both had been rather ’emotionless’, yet if one were to look at the Wight this was hard to believe. Aware that if he didn’t comfort Peter, this could go on for a long time, Logan spoke up.

"I think you are being a bit too hard on yourself. Remember who you were up against. He wasn’t considered the strongest human in the world for nothing. We all saw what that man was capable of. If I had been the one to fight him, my whole body would have most likely been crushed by that single slap you keep mentioning." With that Logan went back to his work, believing that to be the end of this argument.

"But even he wasn’t enough." Peter added. "Even he lost the fight against Slicer, and if he didn’t have his Demon tier Armour he would have been doomed. I know I keep getting stronger based on Quinn’s growth and I can feel that, but then how am I meant to help everyone if I’m just a weaker version of Quinn?"

Letting out a sigh, Logan stopped his work again, facing Peter once more.

"Although you may get your strength from Quinn, you and him are not the same, Your fighting style, your experience, your weapons and such are all different. Just focus on those differences between the two of you and use them to your advantage."

Peter started to consider Logan’s advice. "Let’s see... I heal quicker than Quinn does to the point I can practically regrow limbs. I eat human flesh instead of blood... but none of these things have ever helped me in a fight."

"Isn’t there one more thing that you can do that you haven’t really fully utilised?" Logan asked with a raised eyebrow.

That’s when it clicked in Peter’s head, there was one thing that he could do that was different from Quinn.

"The Wights! I can create other Wights!"

"It seems like you got it. From what I have learned from watching Quinn, vampires are still able to evolve, especially their skills and at a much quicker rate than humans can."

"Perhaps there is something else you can do other than just creating Wights. If it was me, I would keep them and run tests to check if they could evolve into something else."

"Since you should have roughly the same power as Quinn, just Imagine if they could match up to you in strength!" Logan encouraged his friend... and with that he got back to work.

’Wights huh... but I would need dead bodies to create them. Where would I find dead bodies on the Cursed ship, and who?’ Peter thought to himself.

******


# Chapter 1267 - Wight Upgrade

Using his head during a fight wasn’t really Peter’s strong point. Ever since he had turned into a Wight, he had strong emotions that would lean one way or another. These were to be aggressive or protect.

Anything that would make him angry, Peter would act on. If Quinn in particular was ever in trouble, he would risk his life without a second thought to protect him. Still, Peter himself had been noticing that his thoughts were becoming more natural as he started to experience more things.

The aggression was still within him. Even the most minor things would annoy him, such as people leaving their food behind in the canteen without putting it in the trash. Images flashed in his head of picking up the tray and whacking it across one of the members’ heads, teaching them a lesson so they wouldn’t do it again..

However, as he got more like his old self, it was as if his old personality of what he was like before and his new character were mixing to create something else.

’Who am I kidding? I’m just an angry person that’s started to think more.’ Peter thought as he was currently in the medical bay. Hoping to find some dead bodies. On the ship itself, there were even emergency caskets and some dead bodies that were kept just for Peter, but for some reason, he just couldn’t bring himself to turn one of them. His hand was held on one of the handles for a while now.

’I can’t...I can’t disrespect their bodies like that.’ Peter thought as he walked off, trying to come up with some other idea.

Logan’s suggestion was to make Wights and explore what exactly he could do with them. In the past, Peter had often relied on his strength so much that he never bothered making Wights from the enemies he killed because they just wouldn’t be much help to him.

On top of that, even if he killed strong enemies, they just didn’t seem helpful because what made them strong in the first place was their abilities. The two Wights he controlled would also constantly follow him around, which was a pain to him, and was why he would either use them as meat shields or forget about them.

Muttering to himself was just hurting his head more when suddenly he stopped in his tracks.

"Wait, did I ever try to.....that might work."

With the idea running in his head and not wanting to lose this momentum, Peter was seen running straight to a particular room. When he arrived, he could see all of the teleporters’ in sight.

"Hey, which one of these teleporters head to planet Caladi?" Peter asked the four or so guards that were in the room. All of them gulped as soon as they saw Peter. He already had a reputation for having a bad temper, one of the leaders they shouldn’t get on the wrong side of.

"It’s this one over here, sir!" One of the men pointed.

Seeing it, he smiled while walking over to the teleporter.

"Sir, do you have permission from Sam to use-"

"Shut up!" Where Peter’s following words as he placed his hand on the man’s face and pushed him away. "I’ll be back soon, so there’s no need for me to get permission."

With that, Peter had already gone into the teleporter and soon found himself in the Shelter on Planet Caladi. When arriving on the other side, the people there were also part of the Cursed faction, and they were also shocked to see Peter there.

"I know, I know, just tell Sam I won’t be here long," Peter said, and next, using his amazing speed, he was running off in the distance and soon found himself out of the Shelter and in the desert standing on the sand.

"Where is it....where is it." Peter kept searching as he twisted and turned his head. Realising that just looking wasn’t exactly going to help him out, he decided to just use his body’s instincts instead.

’This should work.’

Following naturally where his body wanted him to go, Peter eventually found the place where the Cursed ship had crashed on planet Caladi, where so many people lost their lives. But not only humans had lost their lives.

The area looked mostly cleared, with the human bodies taken away. Still, as for the Dalki bodies, they had remained, letting the sand cover them up or for the beast to take them away. Eventually, Peter started to dig in the sand at a specific spot and saw something dark and black.

Grabbing onto it, he used his great strength to pull it out of the sand, and a mostly intact Dalki was seen. Its arms and limbs were broken.

’When Quinn told us what the Demon tier amulet did, how he was able to control the Dalki and take down those motherships, it gave me an idea, maybe I can do the same. I can’t bring back beasts. I know that much, but my powers let me turn vampires and humans into Wights. Dalki are half-human, so there’s a chance this could work.’

Placing his hand on the Dalki’s chest, soon Peter something was felt leaving Peter’s body, the veins on his arm were showing as the energy passed through his arm, they quickly popped out and went back in again once the energy passed.

At that point, the Dalki’s body started to move again, its body slightly healing from the lesser Wights effect, and soon it stood tall in front of Peter.

"Yes...it worked!" Peter cheered and was so excited that he slammed his fist into the Dalki’s chest and punched its head clean soon after. It fell back in the sand and was unmoving again.

"Ah....well, I didn’t want that one in the first place."

Now realising his ability worked on Dalki, Peter started to dig through different parts of the sand again. Repeating the process as if he was looking for something, but not only was he looking for something, he was testing the limits of his ability as well.

As a Wight, Edward, the ex vampire knight of the tenth family, told him that he had to protect his head at all costs. He could heal any wound as long as his head was kept intact. When he was turned by Quinn, Peter was on the verge of death but not dead, and as a ghoul, he still wasn’t quite classified as an undead creature.

Only when he turned into a Wight did his heart stop beating, so it made him wonder just what the lesser Wights he created were. In the first place, they were only able to be created from dead bodies.

They were unable to use the abilities they had when they were alive but kept the same strength. They seemed a lot more like the typical zombies that one would know about from films, but did it really matter about their brain.

Peter soon found out his answer that it didn’t at all. For things had changed since the last time he had used the ability. Although he hadn’t gone through an evolution, it seemed like the effects of his lesser Wights were more dependent on him.

’It’s just like Logan said, even my Wight powers are evolving with me.’

Peter was looking at a Dalki that had lost its head which was now standing perfectly fine. It was a little strange, and Peter soon found out its limitations. The Dalki was able to heal wounds to a certain degree, just like Peter, but it couldn’t regrow parts of its body that it had lost before it had been turned.

On top of that, after enough damage to the body, unlike Peter, who could restore his regenerative abilities through eating flesh, they could not, and they would finally die, again. Essentially, they were like an item with durability but one that couldn’t be repaired, so eventually, he needed to replace it with a new one.

After many different tests, Peter still didn’t give up, and that’s when he finally found what he was looking for. Pulling out of the sand was a long sharp tail, meters long, and at the end of it were a pair of legs. However, the top half of its body was completely missing.

"This Dalki took way more of a beating compared to the others, but the bitch deserved it." Peter thought, hoping it would work.

It only took a few moments for the smile to appear again, as he saw the legs standing there and the Dalki tail they were all afraid of swinging about.

"Your name was Slicer, right? I guess your bottom half belongs to me now." Peter smiled as he quickly started to run back to the base, with a half Dalki body running after him, keeping up.

Of course, the lesser Wight Peter had created using the bottom half of Slicer’s body wasn’t as strong as her. For one, it didn’t have its whole body, and none of the Dalki Peter had tested on before grew stronger the more blood they split. So it was similar to having half a Slicer with no power up, but the important part was her tail which was still intact.

Entering the Shelter, the two ran straight back for the teleporters. Screaming was heard throughout the Shelter as people spotted the pair of legs and giant tail.

"It’s alright, she’s with me! The legs I mean!" Peter shouted, still smiling.

Because, now that he knew that a head wasn’t needed for turning those into a lesser Wight, he knew exactly who the next person he was going to turn would be and no one would care how he disrespected this body.

******


# Chapter 1268 - I'm Evil
Thinking about what he was about to do next, Peter had a grin on his face that went from ear to ear. He was so pleased, but for those that did manage to catch the look on his face, it looked like a creepy smile rather than a pleasant one.

His deep dark black eye sockets and pale skin didn’t help for that matter. Peter ran through the Shelter with the legs and tail following behind him, causing quite the scene. The problem was, there really was no one who could do anything about it since they were moving so fast.

The teleporter that Peter had come through could be seen ahead left on, and jumping through, he was back on the Cursed ship and soon to follow after him where the pair of legs.

"What the hell is that!" The guard shouted.

"Those scales, and that tail, it’s a Dalki body, I’m sure of it! Attack, attack!"

"Don’t attack!" Peter shouted right after. "Am I going to have to explain these legs everywhere I go? I mean, we have vampires and all sorts of things in the Cursed faction. Heck, Logan has a Dalki arm.. I thought this wouldn’t be too strange."

Looking at them again though, even Peter had to admit it did look a little out of place. A Dalki was relatively large compared to a human, so even though it was just Slicer’s legs, it nearly was as tall as a human itself, and a lot of the Cursed faction looked scared looking at the tail.

"Legs there is with me." Peter calmly said before everyone came raiding the room any second now to take on the Dalki. He could just imagine even Bonny and Void appearing out of nowhere. They always seemed to be around when the most interesting things were happening. A slight smirk appeared on his face as Peter imagined the news reports.

"Actually, do you mind doing me a favour? Report to Sam to come meet me, and then this way he can inform everyone to not be alarmed. Otherwise, all my hard work might be for nothing if everyone started to suddenly attack it."

The guards looked at each other, thinking that Peter must have had a screw loose or something. The reason being, although they knew that Peter was most likely a V, they had no idea of his powers, and this was something that they didn’t know they could do. Due to them not knowing about the subclasses within the vampire race.

In the end, they decided to call Sam to the teleporter station immediately. They listened to Peter just because it looked like the Leg’s and tail weren’t attacking them or anything in the room.

——

A little while later, Sam was seen appearing in the room, with Linda by his side. The only reason why he had brought her was because the men on the other end sounded a bit afraid and had told him to bring some back up with him.

"Come on, what could have Peter brought with him that would be just so-"

He couldn’t even finish his sentence, as his eyes were set on the pair of legs in the room, which at this moment was sitting down, but the large tail could be seen swinging up at a height taller than a human.

"It’s cool, right. I spoke to Logan, and he made me rack my brain a little, so I came up with this." Peter explained.

For Sam, going through all the possibilities in his head, he had figured it out. It was clear that this was the bottom half of Slicer’s Body. The fact that it wasn’t attacking anyone and Peter was the one who had brought it, the most likely reason was it had something to do with his Wight abilities.

"This is good news," Sam said, carefully shuffling towards it, and stopped the second he had got within the range of the tail. When he saw Peter showing it was fine to get close, Sam moved forward, and Linda did the same.

"Her tail was the greatest strength of the Dalki. It was even able to cut through Hilston’s Demon tier armour. This has to be a gold mine. We don’t know if its strength is the same or its sharpness, but I would guess it has to be at a similar level."

Hearing this, Peter had one more surprise for Sam and started to whisper in his ears. After listening to what Peter had to say, his eyes lit up even wider than before.

"1A, is the number," Sam said, and straight away, Peter was running off again. "Legs follow and listen to Sam!" Peter ordered.

Using its tail, it gave off a salute by its waist since it had no head.

’I guess I’m going to have to prepare an announcement.’ Sam thought, looking at the thing.

——

After getting the okay from Sam, Peter found himself in the ship’s morgue. A very cold room, but for Peter, he felt no difference. There were several what looked like file cabinets with numbers in the corner of each of them.

In the very corner of the room, Peter could see the number 1A. Unlike before, without hesitation, Peter was able to pull on the handle, and a body in a glass tube-like container was seen coming out. This was Peter’s next turning target.

The only thing was that it had no head, and the reason for that was Sil stepping on it, eradicating it.

’I can only create two lesser Wights at a time, so why not have the two strongest we have ever seen before.’ Peter thought.

For the next person, he was ready to turn, was Hilston. No one, not even Sil would care what would happen to his body. In fact, the reason why it was in the morgue in the first place was so Peter could feast on it.

’I’m going to have to explain to those guys when they come back, although, without your head, I’m not sure they will recognise you.’ Peter thought, placing his hand on a healthy part of his chest after the glass container covering the body went away.

He knew turning Hilston, he wouldn’t be able to use his abilities like the others he had turned before, but Hilston was supernatural. Even without his beast gear, he had the speed and strength to match a low-level vampire lord. It was an amazing feat, something that seemed impossible.

At the same time, if Hilston turned out to be somewhat weaker, then he imagined it was no loss on their part. Peter would take pleasure in using his body as a human meat shield.

A few seconds later, after repeating the process, the body rose from the table it laid on.

"Haha." Peter chuckled. "Oh, how I would love to punch you right now for that slap, you gave me, but there’s no point. I know it’s better to use you."

With both pieces he needed, Peter was ready to put them into action, just like Quinn. Peter needed to figure out the best way to utilise his two lesser Wights in the middle of a fight while also using his powers. Still, for sure, Peter had now become a formidable foe that nobody would want to face.

This was exactly what Sam was thinking as he was looking at Slicer at the moment.

’Quinn, Leo, Erin, Layla, Sil and now Peter as well. These will be the key members of the Cursed faction in the future. Perhaps if Vorden and Raten evolve into Demon tier beasts as well. We might have a chance at winning this war after all.’

——

On Blade island, currently, Vorden and Raten were trying to do just that. They were going around hunting for strong beasts, improving their skills, and gathering their crystals. There were also the beasts that had been captured that were at the legendary level underneath.

Borden, and Sil were helping as well, but Sil not too much since the others didn’t want him to help. As for Vicky, Pai and their mother and father. The four of them had decided to leave the island and do as they had said they would.

To hunt down those Chained that had strong abilities and a chance in the future to disrupt and ruin the flow of everything. After all, without Turedream present, these were the type of ability users who had chucked the world into chaos before.

For Eno, he was in his favourite spot, looking out from the castle at the whole island staring into space. All the preparation he wanted to do and needed to do was done.

"Sometimes I think of the past," Eno said. "You know, I thought after all these years that I would learn to forget about the past, yet here I am. Brock, Do you think I’m evil?" Eno asked.

"Evil sir is subjective," Brock answered. "You should know that much by now, sir. We have both seen how history books from the humans and the vampires have been written. Sometimes people often put things in categories of good or bad, black and white. While others will say that there is a grey area. For me, I believe that there is just one colour. There is no right and wrong, there is just what people want to do, and you have always just followed what you wanted to do."

After Brock’s answer, there was silence from Eno until he finally spoke.

"It looks like he is finally making his move. We should prepare to call the others back."

# Chapter 1269 - Tired
Lately, Quinn seemed to have been travelling on a number of different surfaces. From hard barren rock, to unknown metals, snow, sand and even more. Right now, Quinn was experiencing yet another new terrain, as his two feet were in a swampy texture.

The water rose up to the ankle of his boots. If he was to stay in one place too long, he would feel like his body was sinking on the spot, so he was constantly on the move. He also needed to be careful not to apply too much pressure for that would make him sink deeper as well.

In a way, he found fighting on different terrain to be a form of training in itself. He never knew when and what terrain he would be fighting his enemies on, so it was good to have experienced all the differences.

Fortunately, this planet also had a few places where the land was more solid, allowing him to rest.

This was exactly what Quinn was currently doing. Around him were several trees that had long green vines dangling from them, so it was hard for one to see into the distance, not that there was anything nice to look at in the first place..

However, Quinn was not alone either. Surrounding him were the Marked Dalki. Thanks to the power of the Demon tier Amulet, Quinn now had a total of four Dalki under his control. Three of them had two spikes on their bodies, while the last one, who had been the most recent captive, had only one for now.

Quinn had considered marking a beast instead of a Dalki, but all the beasts he had encountered in the area were far weaker than even the one spiked Dalki, which made it seem pointless, especially since the amount of energy required to open up another slot was incredibly high at this moment. Failing to mark something, meant he would have to regather that energy once more.

They had been killing beasts and Dalki for a while now, but the fifth slot still hadn’t opened up. Quinn was starting to wonder if four slots were its limit, but the Vampire Lord believed the system would have said something if that would have been the case. Additionally, he didn’t mind the process taking longer, since all this fighting was bringing the Dalki closer to evolving as well

Thanks to his controlled Dalki, Quinn had discovered what incredible beings they actually were. Their bodies had similar healing capabilities to vampires. As long as enough time passed their wounds would naturally heal by using up their body’s energy. Alternatively, they were also able to eat the beasts in the area to acquire more energy and to speed up this healing.

However, if their bodies healed this natural way, it was also a sign that their strong energy they would get from being harmed had gone away as well, unlike when their wounds healed from bleeding out, which was something Quinn still couldn’t wrap his head around. Losing blood, yet still healing from fatal wounds. No wonder the Dalki were so hard to kill.

’Maybe it’s time we move again.’ Quinn contemplated. ’We’ve been on this planet for a while.’

Quinn had chosen not to stay on one planet too long, neither did he want to attempt to take down another one of their mother ships for fear they would retaliate or send someone after him. The problem was moving from each planet took time, and as Quinn moved to each one he was spending more and more time on them.

’The Dalki seem more spread out on this planet compared to the previous ones, so I think you should be fine to stay here a bit longer.’ Vincent shared his opinion. ’Besides, I think things have calmed down a little. That being said, this also feels like the calm before the storm.’

Looking at the Dalki, next to him, Quinn was looking at one of the two spikes, and all four of the Dalki standing still as statues around him like bodyguards, while he was sitting down with his back up against a tree.

’Hey, I was thinking. You have been a big help when fighting with my body, but you’re still not the best when it comes to making the most out of it." Quinn said. "In an emergency I will have to flee by using my Shadow link skill, which might mean I’ll be forced to leave the Marked Dalki behind or I’ll probably have to drain their energy. I won’t be fighting with the Dalki body like last time."

’I’m hoping there is a point to you saying all of this, rather than just telling me my skills are bad in your body.’ Vincent replied.

"What I was thinking, is maybe we can put you in a Dalki body? We could use Shiro’s power." Quinn suggested.

Originally, Quinn wanted to put Vincent in another Humanoid beast, but with the Dalki owning most of the beast planets now, that seemed quite improbable.

’I don’t think that is a good idea, Quinn.’ Vincent replied after a while. ’We know Shiro’s ability basically places one consciousness inside the body of another being, but the original still remains. Even if these Dalki are under the amulet’s control, I doubt their consciousness is completely gone. It only worked so well for your friends because the beasts’ minds inside had agreed to help.’

’Perhaps Shiro has a skill that can eliminate one of the minds, but even then if my mind is in the body of the Dalki, were you thinking of using one of your Marked? We don’t know what will happen to me. I might also end up under the amulet’s effect. Or think about what happens if you need to flee, and you might drain that body.’

’I’m also partly worried that moving me will disrupt the system.’Even if it doesn’t, my existence might have been a coincidence, so moving me out means there is the possibility that I might not have any no way to return to the system either, if something has to go wrong with it. I know you mean well, but I just think that if we act now there are too many risks. Let’s wait until this is all over.’

That was the problem, Quinn honestly didn’t know when this would ’all’ be over, especially with things happening in the Vampire World now. Would it be when Jim was defeated? When Arthur no longer was a threat?

Even then he still needed to worry about the Dalki, the Demon tier beast and Bryce. Not to mention his unresolved issues with Pure, who he was sure would eventually come to him since he had eliminated Agent 2 as well now.

"I’m...getting a little tired just thinking about it." Quinn sighed, which was the first time Vincent had heard him say such words.

———

Eventually a week had passed on the Cursed ship. As promised Leo had been training both Erin and Layla. Helping them use their Qi, as well as trying to unlock the soul weapons in both of them.

What Leo didn’t know was that Layla had also been doing her own separate training alongside Nate following their training sessions. After her loss with Erin, she had been more determined to work harder.

Her training with Nate had mostly focused on her being able to access those emotions again and unlock the fourth form. What Nate hadn’t realised when offering to help her was that their ’training’ had been more on the lines of a therapy session rather than using one’s fists which was what Nate was good at.

He had asked Layla many times if she was sure that she wouldn’t rather speak to someone else, who she might perhaps be closer to than him, but she had insisted that he was the easiest to talk to, for she felt like he would never judge her.

According to her judgement, the only thing Nate cared about was girls and getting better at martial arts. Someone else might have been offended by that, but Nate had just shrugged it off, even going so far as to make a joke about Layla having seen right through to his core.

One of the things the two had discussed was the warning that Leo had given on that first day. It was strange but all he had said was to be careful with the sword she was using.

However, after learning that Quinn thought it would be fine for her to have the sword, Leo thought that it would be fine for now. Especially since she had already been using it for a while with no apparent problems.

In the end though, Erin and Leo were soon to leave the Cursed ship. Their equipment was finally complete.

Arriving in the forgery room, Alex and Andrew had naturally done their classic ’covering of the items with a cloth’ trick.

"You do know that this is pointless for me." Leo said. "For one, I can already see what they look like underneath the cloth, even though I do not know the colours, not that it makes much of a difference to me."

After hearing that, Erin had decided to lift the cloth to reveal the items that they would now be using.

"Hey!" Alex pouted. "How could you steal the best part of this?! It’s like opening up a package that you ordered online! Imagine coming home and finding out that someone else had opened your package. Or opened your presents on Christmas to still give you the present. It just ruins the feeling."

Still ignoring him, Erin first went to look at the giant cover that had been built for her Demon tier weapon. It was designed to be strapped around her waist, and had straps over her shoulders while being placed on her back.

The large piece was the perfect shape for the large sword. The three holes that were in the blade, the cover also had indents to show where they would be, not ruining the design and beauty of the demon tier weapon.

"After seeing you, I chose to go with a black and yellow design for the cover." Andrew explained. "I was pretty sure the last time I saw you, you had black hair so I decided to go with that, but now I see you have blonde hair."

Andrew thought his eyes were playing tricks on him but thought Erin must have just dyed it while she was staying on the ship, not realising that it was part of Erin’s abilities. Although she could control the change at will now.

"Thank you, it is excellent." Erin was more than pleased with it. When placing the sword in the cover, she couldn’t even see its energy with her ability. The suppression powers were more impressive than the chains she was wearing.

’If the urge ever comes back in the future, I should seek out this forger to help me.’ Erin decided at that moment.

On Alex’s table was Leo’s weapon and Erin’s Katana. It was time for Leo to find out whether or not his sword had been put to good use.

******

# Chapter 1270 - Everyone Upgraded
It had been a while since Leo had received a new blade to use. He had trusted his cursed sword for so long and had always had it by his side. Although it wasn’t the best blade for hunting beasts, he didn’t need it to be, thanks to Leo’s skills and his power of Qi.

The main reason he kept the blade was due to the Curse that had been left behind in the weapon. He could feel the power of the sword rise with energy whenever he fought against the Dalki. If he had ever outright told people this, they would think he had gone mad.

No one had heard of such a thing happening before, but it worked similar to a passive skill, only when going up against the Dalki. Which was why he also knew that it might be impossible for Alex to pass on this sort of thing when creating a new weapon.

"I think it’s best if you picked it up," Alex said smiling, and Leo did just that, and when he did, he could tell instantly.

"I’m sorry to say, but if I pick that thing up myself, I think I wouldn’t be able to work for the rest of the day." Alex chuckled.. He was proud of his accomplishments.

Although he didn’t have the same ability as Leo or was as intune at sensing different types of Qi, he could tell that when creating the weapon with the Demi-god tier crystal, something had happened. Everything changed when he had melted down Leo’s old sword. The power was still strong from it, and adding it to the new Demi-god tier weapon, he had created something he had never done so before.

Leo picked it up, and it was nearly an identical weight to his last sword, but just as Alex said, the Curse didn’t weaken. Instead, it was enhanced. The sword had a complete makeover in colour, as the hilt was black, and the sword had a wave pattern going along the metal. The bottom half is a dark purple with a bladed edge.

"I wasn’t able to really touch the sword after it was complete. I wasn’t joking about what I said earlier, so I’m not sure if it has an active skill or not." Alex said.

Leo placed the sword away in the sheath he had. Since the blade was identical to his last one in size and shape, it fitted perfectly. He wouldn’t test if it had an active skill or not for now, for he didn’t know what It could do and would be afraid it could hurt others.

There was no Quinn here, where one could use their inspect skill to find out weapons’ active or passive skills. Finally, Leo had a Demi-god blade that could rival any weapon out there, and with his strength in Qi, he was sure he wouldn’t lose out to Demon tier weapons either.

The next blade that was placed on the table was also a katana style blade. It looked pretty regular for a blood weapon. Just leak a katana blade one would see any forger make. Though there were differences.

If one was to look closely, in the middle of the blade was a single line that went all the way to the tip. It was clear to see through like glass. That’s when Erin noticed there was something similar at the bottom of it as well.

"The details are due to it being a blood weapon," Alex explained. "The sword fills up as more blood is inputted into the sword, and then as you use its powers more, you will see the blood draining down from the tip. Not all blood weapons have this, but I got the idea from seeing Fex’s blood weapon.

"I think it’s a good idea in a fight to know when you need to refill it, a bit like a car."

It made Erin wonder. The sword worked from being filled with Human blood. They were informed that it also worked with Dalki blood. However, it did not empower itself with vampire blood. What about her own blood?

After all, she was considered only half-vampire, perhaps her blood was different, but she had decided not to test that out in front of Alex, not that she didn’t trust him, but she just didn’t want to feel different, even amongst the other subclasses on the ship.

’Even Alex now has another Blood fairy by his side, yet I’m the only Dhampir? What would happen if I tried to turn someone?’ Shaking her head and placing the sword in her own scabbard, she tried to let such thoughts go out from her head.

Having collected both of their weapons, they thanked Alex and Andrew for their creations. The two of them headed back to the teleportation room to finally head back to the Vampire world.

"Are you sure you don’t want to say goodbye to Layla before we leave?" Leo asked.

"No," Erin said. "I see no point in saying goodbye because I believe we will be returning soon anyway."

"Well, let’s just hope that not much has happened in the vampire world while we were away. The fact that Paul has allowed us to travel back there should be a good sign." Leo commented. Although he was thinking it could be a bad one as well. As it also could indicate that he needed their help.

The two of them stepped through the teleportation heading back to the vampire world.

——

A short while later, and Sam had learnt of the two of them having already headed back. He felt a little bad, for he had just missed the two of them. If they had stayed a little longer, they could have come on board for what he had planned next. For he had just received a bit of good news.

’I guess the two of them will be okay without it anyway, and perhaps they are needed more over there.’ Sam thought.

Still, he would deliver the news to the rest of the Cursed leaders, as a meeting had been called in the command centre for all of them. Everyone arrived promptly, compared to how they would usually.

With how things were, every one of them was prepared for an announcement that a fight was about to set off at any second. Sam could see this as everyone had a serious look for once on their face.

"Wow, I wish you guys were like this every time. You can relax, I guess you could say this is good news for you all." Sam smiled. "As you know, Quinn had ordered all the high tier crystals to go to those that were hunting on the front line. Because of this, the Daisy faction had used most of the crystals for themselves to create beast armour and more.

"Next, Quinn wanted the forgers to also create equipment for themselves to protect themselves if there was another attack on the Cursed ship, just like there was one recently. On top of this, there is a crystal shortage so nearly all crystals gathered have to be stored and rationed out to the other Shelters. Because of all of this, the Cursed leaders have been lacking in the equipment department."

So far, everything Sam had said just made it sound like there wasn’t any good news at all, but the best news was to come.

"I just got a report from Vorden, who is on Blade island at the moment. Apparently, Hilston was keeping some pretty interesting things underneath his castle. It’s been a long time since you got anything, so I thought it would be nice for all of you to upgrade. What I am suggesting is for the leaders of the Cursed group to head to the Blade island and get first pick on the equipment there."

Hearing about this, there were some large smiles on some of their faces, Particularly Nate and others. They didn’t really use beast weapons. So having a strong set of beast armour and items was vital.

"The beast equipment has already been forged. My guess is he properly also stripped some of the Chained and threw their equipment in there. So no one can complain about us keeping using crystals to make items, this is the best use for it, and then with the remainder of the items, we will hand them out to the rest of the crew."

It certainly was good news for them all. Even Layla was pleased by this. She had a great weapon by her side, and her training was bearing fruit. If she had a new set of armour on top of this, she would grow even further.

"I do have one last thing to mention," Sam said before everyone got too excited. "Everyone here will be going to the island, while Megan will be left in charge of the place."

"So you will be coming as well, Sam?" Nate asked, thinking back to the last time the two of them could hunt or fight together side by side.

"Yes, including me, but there is a reason for this. Richard Eno believes that an attack is bound to happen soon, which is why I have also decided to send all of us to the island. With the teleporters back online, we can travel from there to here, but we also have to make sure that no one gets through those teleporters.

"If everyone understands, then let’s get to it," Sam said with a smile, happy to finally be leaving the Cursed ship after a long time.

Before they left, Peter cleared his throat.

"Ah, thats right," Sam said, struggling to get his words out. "I do have to make everyone aware that you might be seeing a pair of legs and a headless man around..."

*******

# Chapter 1271 - The Calm Before The Storm
The Cursed leaders were pleased that for the first time in a long time all of them would be travelling together. It was usual for large parties to go out on expeditions, but in the past Sam had always asked for a team to stay behind, so they could protect the Cursed ship from attacks like the one just recently.

However, Sam was predicting that something big was very likely going to occur on Blade Island in the near future and with most of the Cursed ship’s former crew left behind on Caladi, it was no longer much of a target for their enemy.

On top of that, Sam wanted to reward everyone’s hard work by granting them first dibs on Hilston Blade’s secret stash of treasure, so that everyone could find something suitable for themselves.

Going through the teleporter, the group arrived. Unfortunately, the location of their arrival had already been set and it didn’t take any time at all for everyone to freeze up.

"D-D-D... DRAGON..." Wevil sniveled as he was pointing at the beast, his teeth chattering by the second.

By Eno’s will they had all arrived near the tablet, which also meant that it was next to its protector. Not all of them had the ’pleasure’ of having met with a Demon tier Beast. Wevil and Linda had been there when Quinn had fought against the giant pink tree, but this one had a completely different feel to it..

Sam wanted to tell them to calm down, but as someone who was still shaking at the mere sight of it, it was a hard message for him to convey. Eventually, after staying in the Dragon’s presence without any incident for a while, the members of their expedition started to carefully move again.

It helped that the beast appeared to be sleeping. At one point, probably reacting to their movement, it had briefly opened one of its giant eyes to take a quick look at the newcomers. Even those who had come here before, froze up when faced with the beast’s attention.

Fortunately, after taking one big sniff with its large snout, it simply closed its eye again. In total it had only paid attention to them for a few seconds, before it had chosen to ignore them. Still, it had been enough for many of them to see their life flash before them.

"Okay!" Sam exclaimed, happy that he hadn’t just ended up as a snack. However, he quickly turned around to the beast, afraid that he had just disturbed its rest, after realising that he had just shouted, but fortunately it just let out another snore.

In a lower voice he said: "Let’s do a count to check that everyone is here."

There were Peter, Layla, Logan, Fex who had a large box on his back that looked similar to a coffin, Nate, Wevil, Linda and of course Sam himself. Additionally, following behind Peter were Hilston’s large muscular body, which still had a hole in its chest and was missing his head, as well as Slicer’s bottom half which Peter just referred to as ’Legs’.

It caused the others to naturally step away from Peter. When they had learned about what he had done, even the other leaders had regarded the Wight’s action as more than a little crazy. All of them were worried about the consequences if Slicer’s bottom half could at some point overcome the loyalty she was placed under. It would be a disaster if she would turn on them at some point.

The reason for Peter’s confidence was that he knew that he would never do anything to harm Quinn, so he was sure that his Lesser Wights had to share the same feeling towards him. Still, the others couldn’t shake the uneasy feeling they got from Legs, afraid that he might have put too much trust in his ability.

"Peter, you might want to be careful when Sil and the others see... ’that’." Linda pointed at Hilston’s body, trying to caution him.

"Yeah, I wouldn’t be surprised if they attack your new creepy friends straight away." Fex agreed, keeping his eye on Legs’ tail moving back and forth. It reminded him of an excited dog that was happy to be by its owner’s side.

He was only seeing it from the corner of his eye, but it was so annoying that the vampire just had to grab it to make it stop, but to his surprise he grabbed onto nothing but air.

’What the... did that stupid tail just dodge me?!’ Even more annoyed by his failure, Fex attempted to grab it again and again, but each time the tail moved faster, to the point the vampire got ready to use his string ability to slow it down.

"Stop that, gel boy!" Peter growled at Fex. "Legs belong to me now! I can’t get another one, so don’t ruin it!"

"Alright, everyone settle down please. We’re all here now, but where is Dennis? He was meant to be meeting us." Sam wondered, looking around the place.

While they were waiting for their pickup to collect them and take them to their destination, Wevil and Linda found another interesting thing when they walked towards the centre of the open space.

"Hey isn’t that.." Wevil was still feeling uneasy because of the sleeping Dragon, but now there was another thing that he felt he should be worrying about.

"Yeah, I’m sure of it. It looks almost identical to the Demon tier beast that was on the Graylash planet." Linda gulped down hard. The two of them were too afraid to get too close, but they did notice that it was far smaller than the one they had seen.

Eventually, a gust of wind was felt on all of their faces from a distance, and quite a large one at that, and that’s when they could see a black furred creature arriving in front of them all.

"It’s good to see you again." Vorden greeted them. Currently sitting on his back was Dennis, who quickly climbed down, holding a hand to his mouth.

"How could those kids like this type of ride? I think I’m going to thro-." Before he could even finish his sentence, he hurled over.

Poor Dennis hadn’t accounted for the fact that Vorden had played with the kids before his evolution. As a Legendary tier beast his wind powers and speed had improved dramatically. Unless he held back, Vorden was sure that the kids would also be unable to handle the kind of speed he used to get here.

At first, Vorden was all smiles as he looked at everyone, until his eyes landed upon the headless body.

"What is that?!" Vorden questioned, his eyes turning to slits.

"You’re going to have to be more specific, you wanna know more about Legs, or the headless one?" Peter asked casually.

While Sam was explaining the situation to Vorden, Layla who was at the back of the group was more concerned about something else. Ever since she had set foot on the island, the black sword by her side had been violently shaking.

’What’s wrong with it? Is it reacting to the Dragon? Or is it because of the strange tree?’ Layla wondered.

Putting this to the test, she started to walk towards the two, but the second she stepped towards the Demon tier beast, the shaking of the blade lessend. She was pleased that the sword wasn’t reacting to the Dragon, because truth be told she didn’t want to get closer.

When walking towards the tree she expected something to happen as well, but there was nothing on that end either.

Then, heading back towards one last thing, she finally noticed.

’So it seems to react to the tablet? ... Will something happen if I touch it?’ Layla thought, unsure whether she should test it out or not.

——

While the Cursed faction were busy on Blade Island, Owen along with his Graylash faction were currently the busiest of the three groups in the war against the Dalki. Although they had agreed to not go on a full force attack, Owen and his people were successfully winning every single skirmish they were coming across.

This was mainly due to the planet they were on. There were dark clouds above them, which would pour constant rain on the planet. More importantly with these types of conditions it tremendously boosted the elemental powers of lightning.

On the ground, there had been news of another small camp having been set up. Owen could see it up ahead, and he didn’t have the others by his side.

’Any Dalki we take down now, will be one less we will have to worry about later on.’ Owen thought, as he struck thunder bolts into the clouds above where the Dalki had set up, and soon lightning started to strike down at the Dalki in their small camp.

It looked like there were twenty of them in total. With this first attack, he soon charged in like a lightning bolt himself, but he wasn’t alone. He and his partner entered the sloppily built small camp and immediately got to work, firing off their powers, aiming at the Dalki’s vital points, finishing them with their great strength.

The Dalki in the camp didn’t even have time to react and after ten minutes, all twenty or so Dalki had been defeated.

"If I counted correctly you got twelve while I finished eight. You really have improved, little Owen." An old man dressed in white robes said.

"I’m happy that there is someone in the family that can challenge me a little." Owen happily accepted the praise. After all it came from Grim Graylash, his grandfather and the previous leader of the Graylash family.

"I’m happy that my genes seem to have merely skipped a generation. When your father grew up and didn’t show much promise in regards to our ability, I was worried for the Graylash family, for what would happen when Hilston would take me away, but I see I didn’t have to worry at all."

It looked like Owen now owed Quinn another favour for returning someone who was important to him. With the two of them, they were able to take out camps and scout groups just by themselves, a feat that was giving a massive morale boost to those in the Graylash family.

It was then that the two of them received a message.

"Sir, this is Hermes reporting. We have spotted the one you were looking for, not too far from the Shelter, and it looks like the Dalki are ready for a full force attack. Please come back immediately!"

With their powers, the two of them could move fast, so getting back in time wasn’t a problem, but the message hadn’t ended there.

"Sir, a warning. The Dalki you fought before seems to have returned... however it appears to be a five spike now."

———

At the same time, Eno, who had been doing nothing but waiting for the Cursed faction’s arrival, finally stood up.

"Brock, it’s time for you to call Quinn. Tell him to come back immediately. Jim is making his move."

*****

# Chapter 1272 - Hunting For Treasure
Vorden led the Cursed group to the underground storage place that was located underneath the castle. Surprisingly, the beasts that would usually be loud as one would go down the elevator remained silent.

Coming down, nobody else was present at the moment, which Vorden took as a good thing, because he was hoping to explain things to the other three before they reacted to seeing a certain headless person.

When walking through the dark tunnels, they went past several large cells that used to have beasts inside them, but instead they were filled with other things.

"Whoah, are all of those beast crystals? Didn’t Sam say that Hilston didn’t keep any in his storage?" Fex asked, amazed not just by the number of them but the quality as well. Truth was, Sam was also curious about that. He had just told the others what he himself had been told.

"That’s because those aren’t Hilston’s crystals. Those are crystals all of us have collected from the beasts we’ve killed." Vorden explained.

Now Sam understood a bit more since he knew that both Raten and Vorden could evolve. They must have been gathering the crystals to use them when they had enough to evolve.

’If I remember correctly, after consuming each crystal there is a waiting period for the beast body to evolve, this is also when they are at their weakest and most vulnerable. I guess Vorden and Raten decided that they would take all the crystals in one go to minimise this risk, but I wonder if that means the time to absorb all the crystals energy will be longer as well.’ Sam thought to himself.

When they finally entered the main room, they all stood there for a few seconds as they looked over heaps and heaps of beast equipment. Just a small percentage of all those weapons, armours would be enough to make the other factions go crazy, but here they were, just sitting there like piles of trash.

To their collective surprise, the first person to make a move was Fex. He ran over to one pile and started to sort through it.

"Hey what is he doing?" Linda asked.

"I can’t believe he was faster." Wevil mumbled as he activated his transformation, turning his body partly into the tiger beetle, which focused on speed. "Remember what Sam said? Everything is first come, first serve!"

Before Linda could say anything, Wevil was already on top of another pile of equipment and started to search for the best one there. Sam just began to shake his head, elated that neither Bonny nor Void were here for this scene would severely damage their reputation.

’Why are they behaving like this? They should know that all of them specialise in different weapons! Is this really my fault for believing they would act better than wild animals?’ Sam wondered, as he watched Wevil and Fex both pull on the same armour, both of them wanting to try it out. Ultimately, he let out a sigh and decided to join in looking for new equipment as well.

During the following thirty minutes, all of them were busy testing out the loot. Even if it wasn’t their weapon of choice, many would be swinging swords, bashing other items against each other, checking for active skills and more, until a few more people had entered the cave.

"All of you’re a bunch of kids!" Raten shouted, after watching them uncontrolled. At that moment, Vorden and the others stopped what they were doing. Only Peter, and his two helpers had completely ignored who had just entered.

"Peter!" Linda called out.

Hearing his name, he turned his head, and his two helpers did the same.

"What the fu-" Raten was about to curse. but he too quickly turned his head thinking that another person would have a worse reaction. All eyes were looking towards Sil.

Strangely, Sil had almost no reaction at all when looking at the body and just... greeted the others.

"It’s nice to see you all."

They wondered if Sil hadn’t registered Peter’s Lesser Wights, but it seemed impossible. Sil had even looked over at the body a couple of times, but there was no anger, no aggressiveness or anything from him at all.

"Sil... are you alright with this?" Vorden eventually asked, coming over to him, and looking in the direction of the headless body.

"Although that thing looks like Hilston, I know it’s not him. He’s dead... I’ve made sure of it. If anything, seeing his headless body walk around, taking orders from Peter of all people, I feel relieved. It’s further proof that Hilston will never come to haunt us." Sil explained.

Raten and Vorden looked at each other, both feeling the same thing. Their little brother had really grown up. For the first time, Sil was the most reasonable out of the three, his words alleviating their own doubts.

The group continued to look through the equipment, their former fervor cooling down as they began to help each other out by looking for some treasures underneath. Borden, who was in his small form and had great strength, was especially well suited for this task.

Eventually, Sam, who wasn’t too picky in this department, decided on a mismatch of Legendary and Emperor tier equipment at which point he stopped looking. It was tiring trying all the equipment out. Sometimes it was hard to tell what tier they were at without wearing them, so Sam had just chosen the ones he had felt had granted him the best stats, rather than something with strong active skills that suited him.

While getting out of everyone’s way, he suddenly received a call coming from none other than Sach.

"Sam, I don’t have much time to speak, but I’ll be sending you a file that will update you on all the information." Sach informed the other as soon as the call had been answered. "In essence, the Graylash faction is about to be attacked by a Dalki army led by a five spiked Dalki."

"What’s more, it seems like One Horn is finally making his moves as well. This is not a message asking for your help. I trust you will do whatever is best, but I also remember Eno’s words during the meeting that he was relying on us to defend Blade Island. Unfortunately, I’m afraid we won’t be able to while being tangled up in this."

Hearing all of the information, Sam had one question on his mind.

"What about the Cursed faction planets? How are Helen and the others coping?"

"So far, theirs is the only side that shows no signs of movement." Sach reported. "For further details, please read through the reports. I’m sorry, but I have to go now." Sach ended the call.

’The Dalki...they have started to attack the other sections but haven’t attacked the Cursed faction yet. There are two things I can think of. Either one of the Dalki leaders is on their way here to Blade Island while the other two are busy, trying to hold up our forces, or that Slicer was originally meant to lead the attack but her death ruined their plans.’

Either way, Sam thought at least they still had time as Blade Island was in no such trouble at the moment. This did make him feel bad for the other groups, wondering if each one could handle a five spiked Dalki on their own.

’Should I inform Quinn? This seems like a decision he should make, whether we should help one of the two groups?’ Sam hesitated.

It was then that one more person entered the cave. Hearing the footsteps Sam immediately turned his head, only to find Brock walk in with his hands behind his back.

"You appear to have just been updated on the current situation outside." Brock noted. "I can guess what you must be thinking, but it’s not a good idea to decrease our own force at this moment. Remember what Eno said. If they get their hands on the Demon tier beast, this war is basically lost."

"Think, why would they have started attacking those places but not here yet? If I were them, I would let some time pass, pressuring my enemy to send over some help and the second they do, that’s when I would strike this place."

Sam didn’t like it but Brock’s argument made sense. In the past, they might have doubted the Dalki’s strategic capabilities, but them attacking all the planets at once, had proven that humanity had been wrong to underestimate them in this regard.

Nevertheless, Sam felt bad knowing that lives were being lost while they were just waiting on Blade Island, protecting what felt like an almighty beast of all things rather than their fellow people. The only good news was that their Cursed faction weren’t under attack.

If they were, then they would probably have to move at least some of the group that was currently with them.

"I have come here to tell you that Eno claims we need Quinn. Please contact him and tell him to come back to the island right now." Brock delivered the message needed.

Sam also didn’t like the way he was being talked to, but for the greater good he swallowed his displeasure down. Even with all of them there, Richard Eno still seemed to be worried and knowing that old man there had to be a good reason behind that.

———

"So Quinn that’s all the information I have, Eno wants you to return to the island now and by now I think he means straight away, but it’s up to you to decide what you want to do." Sam reported, leaving the decision for Quinn to make.

******

# Chapter 1273 - Risk Your Life
Quinn felt like it was a good thing he was relaxed and still sitting by the swampy tree when he had received the message, because it certainly was something he wanted to take his time to think about instead of rushing over head first.

Fortunately, although Eno seemed adamant for Quinn to come as soon as possible, according to Sam nothing had happened on Blade Island yet. Right now, only the other two groups were involved in fights.

’There are two actions I could take next.’ Quinn started to list his options. ’I could go back right now by using my Shadow ability. That way I’ll be by their side, could help them make preparations and could also find out why Eno wants me back so badly.’

’Alternatively, I could just continue training here with the Marked Dalki until the last second. If I’m lucky, it will allow me to open up a fifth slot from the Demon tier Amulet, so I can be as strong as possible when they do need me.’

It was troublesome since both options had their upsides and downsides. Especially when thinking back to how strong the five spiked Dalki were.. Quinn just wasn’t sure if he was ready yet.

Nevertheless, Quinn leaned towards heading back now, yet he didn’t exactly enjoy being on Eno’s call. It made him feel as if he was just another one of Eno’s chess pieces in this entire war.

’If you want my opinion, I also think we should go back now, so we can prepare with Eno and the others. I don’t like him either, but there is a reason behind everything he does and his goals coincide with our own.’ Vincent reasoned.

Mulling over it for a little while longer, Quinn eventually stood up as he had come to a decision.

’You’re right, I’ll head back to Blade Island, but not because of what you said.’ Quinn insisted. ’I can take the Dalki with me, by putting them in my shadow space, and then use my Shadow link, I doubt even Eno knows that I am able to do this, so I’ll keep them as my trump card for now."

’I will need to use their strength and drain them anyway, if we run into something like another five spiked Dalki, after all. Besides, Sam said that nearly everyone is already on Blade Island. If I delayed my return trying to get stronger, and anyone were to die, it would be solely my own fault.’

Of course, Vincent was happy with Quinn’s answer. Honestly both options seemed fine, but he was happy that Quinn still had kept this part of him, the one that cared about his friends more so than anything and he hoped that would never change.

It was finally time for Quinn to return to his friends’ side. Using his Shadow link, he looked for someone he could connect to. While doing this though, there was something else Quinn noticed.

’His...Shadow is activated at the moment? Does that mean he’s using it as well?’ Quinn could feel someone else’s shadow being used, and it wasn’t anyone from the Cursed faction.

This was a big distraction for him, but he decided to shake it off for now and stick to the task at hand, if anything it meant Quinn needed to be more cautious.

After connecting to Dennis, Quinn’s body started to sink in the shadow.

’I should train the Shadow link skill more and level it up, maybe then I can bring others with me as well, without having to use the Shadow lock skill.’ Quinn thought as he could only see darkness around him.

One moment all he could see was darkness, the next he was greeted by a bright blue sky, with white fluffy clouds and a certain clean smell. It had been a long time since Quinn had been on Earth, and the other beast planets just didn’t have the same atmosphere as their home planet.

Closing his eyes, Quinn sniffed the air, taking in the smell that he had missed.

"I see you are as relaxed as ever." The voice that spoke up immediately soured his mood, and when Quinn opened his eyes he could see Eno in front of him. Next to him was Brock and it looked like they were all standing on top of the castle wall.

"Quinn, you look good!"

"Welcome back Boss."

"Hey, there he is!"

Turning around, Quinn acknowledged the greetings from the Cursed group with a nod. To his surprise nearly all of them were wearing beast gear he had never seen before.

Quickly using his Inspect skill, Quinn could see the impressive gear that was on all of their bodies. That’s when he also noticed that some of them weren’t there as well.

"Where are the Blades?" Quinn asked, looking around.

Sam was the first to go up to Quinn, hoping to catch him up on what was happening so far, and what they were about to do.

"Since you didn’t reply back straight away, we thought you might have decided to arrive some time later." Sam explained as he looked towards Eno and Brock who waited for the two of them, yet the old man’s tapping foot made it clear that he wanted them to hurry up. "So I kinda gave them the go ahead to start Eno’s plans without you."

"Although Eno insists that the attack will happen soon, we have no clue when exactly. That’s why we made the decision to send Sil back so he can gather the powers he needs. We will call him as soon as the fighting starts here."

The big downsides of the Blade ability was that it required people with abilities and that the copied abilities only lasted for twenty four hours. Unfortunately, vampires didn’t count, yet one thing they wanted to avoid was bringing people over who could act like the Chained for Sil’s usage. Taking anybody to Blade Island would just be too dangerous.

"As for the other two, knowing what is about to come, Raten and Vorden are in the middle of consuming the beast crystals. You know about their bodies getting weak after doing so, which is why Borden is protecting them underground in the storage place just in case anything is to happen." Sam explained.

With Sam having told Quinn everything, Eno came forward, cleared his throat to say his piece.

"This time, I have no master plan. I don’t even know who exactly our foe will be, whether it will just be Dalki, Vampires or perhaps a mix of both. Naturally, I don’t know their exact numbers either. I could give you some estimations we have, but if you rely on that it might just backfire. As such, it seems better to not share any flawed information and just prepare for the worst, which is what I will be doing now."

"What we need to concentrate on, is the things we do know. The Dalki are after the Demon tier beast. It prefers to stay near the giant tablet. At all costs we’ll have to protect these three things in order of priority. The Dragon, the Tablet and finally the teleporter."

"All three of them are located at the centre of the island, close to each other. However, this is a good and a bad thing. Good, because our last line of defense will be here, without the need to split up. Bad, because it also means that before that we can be attacked from all directions. In essence, the whole island will be our battlefield."

"Look at the people who are here right now. I know we have requested help, I have even called for help on my side, but it’s quite possible that we will have to deal with everything with just the people who are here right now. Keep that in mind."

"Another thing we can’t really influence will be the Dragon’s reaction when it senses so many invaders coming here. If the situation arises when you’ll have to ask yourself ’Do I sacrifice my life for the Demon tier beast?’ I want your resolve to be ’Yes!’. If the Demon tier beast gets taken, then all of the human race is doomed."

The others heard this and looked at each other. They knew of the importance of this task, and every time they had fought they had done so with their lives on the line, but usually they could see the faces of the people they were protecting.

As for Quinn, he didn’t agree with this at all.

"What the hell kind of pep talk was that, Eno?! I understand that we should do everything we can to stop them from taking the Demon tier beast, but how is us dying going to help anyone?! If it comes down to it, we should live to fight again another day!"

"If that’s really your resolve, then they have practically already succeeded in taking the Demon tier beast!" Eno sighed. "How can you still underestimate the significance of this thing? You might not be ready to give it your all, but I can guarantee you, at least the Dalki will pay any price they have to, to make sure they get it into their hands!"

"Then what about you? Do you have that resolve? Are you prepared to risk your own life for once?! How dare you ask my people, my friends to risk their life if you aren’t prepared to do the same?!" Quinn shouted.

"Who says I’m not?" Eno replied, as he placed his hands together and a red glow could be seen.

*****

# Chapter 1274 - The Red Crown
Quinn wasn’t quite sure what was about to happen next. The red glow in between Eno’s hands started to get brighter and brighter, until it was as bright as a flashlight, blinding them all. They had no choice but to look away, especially the vampires whose eyes were far more sensitive to the change in brightness.

’Is this it? Has Eno finally snapped and revealed his true colours?’ Quinn was ready to protect his friends. Activating his shadow, he was ready to summon the Dalki as backup. There was one thing that Quinn worried about, he had yet to see Eno’s full strength and given his powerful ability that was free to do so many things he had to be cautious.

However, the only thing that happened was that the light started to fade, revealing Eno. However, he looked completely different compared to just moments ago. His whole body was covered in a dark red armour and on top of his head there was what looked to be a type of crown. It was a thin band that went all the way round through his hair, yet it had three red spikes sticking out. The one in the middle was the largest and resembled a horn with the way it pointed upwards.

’Is that... is that the Blood armour?’ Was Quinn’s immediate thought.. In the past, Quinn had seen Arthur in Blood armour when he had fought Hilston, although back then the Punisher hadn’t used it against his foe.

"...how? Wasn’t there only meant to be two sets of Blood armour in existence? One that belongs to the King-"

"And the other to the Punisher Arthur." Eno cut Quinn off. "I’m surprised you’re that knowledgeable about our history, but there are still things that you don’t know about this world. I was the First King of our vampire society. I was the one that decided that the Punishers should be created and I am the one that is prepared to act! If no one else will put their life on the line to stop this vampire, then I will!" Eno proclaimed strongly, his aura having taken a regal tone thanks to his new outfit.

Quinn had been paying close attention to the other’s heart rate ever since he had donned the armour, studying his facial expression to see if there was any hint of hesitation, but there had been no signs that Eno had been lying.

The thing Quinn still couldn’t understand was why someone so old was prepared to risk their life more than he himself was. Not only had Eno apparently told them the truth, but he hadn’t even shown any hesitation whatsoever than he had claimed to be ready to lay down his own life for the cause.

Nevertheless, Quinn couldn’t help but be suspicious. For someone who has lived for as long as Eno had, it wouldn’t surprise him if he had either learned or come up with some trick to hide all these signs. Years to become a good enough actor, to control his heart beat so it wouldn’t flutter, or perhaps lying on the spot was something that was just second nature to him.

’A third Blood armour set... I never heard of such a thing. How I wish I could have studied it in my time...’ Vincent noted. As a former researcher whose passion it had been to look into things, his passion about the vampire’s past had blessed him with great knowledge. Yet even he had never heard of such a thing. ’Say what you will about Eno, but I have to admire his ability to have a backup plan for everything.’

Point in case, Quinn had never been part of Eno’s equation in the first place. The Vampire Lord was someone completely outside his expectations who had continued to defy common sense and any expectation the Original Vampire had for him.

He could have easily left everything to Quinn and the Cursed faction, something he had done often enough in the past, yet Eno was now ready to risk his own life. Still, Quinn couldn’t agree with the words that were said before.

"I’m sick of it. I’m tired of it." Quinn shouted again. "I’m tired of people who think they know better, who are stronger, making decisions for others. We have our own lives, the people we care about our own decisions. Eno, you might think differently because of how long you have lived. You look at not just humans, but even me who is a vampire like a child. A child who is naive and hasn’t lived through what you have so they need to listen to what you have to say."

"I won’t deny that." Eno shrugged, before shaking his head. "How can I not, when after all this time that has passed, everyone keeps making the same mistakes? It’s my job to correct them."

Not having any more words to say to Eno directly, Quinn decided to leave the area to calm down. He could tell that there were no amount of words that would change how the other would think. At the same time, he didn’t know why he had gotten so frustrated.

Was it because he was tired? Quinn felt like not just him but the whole Cursed faction had already been pushed to their limit far more times than should be reasonable. Or was it the fact that Eno was right, but he just didn’t want him to be?

Eventually walking away, hoping to calm down, no one knew what to say. They had felt Quinn’s frustration many times during the war.

"Quinn..." Sam murmured, but decided that now was not the right time to approach him, and wanted to hear if Eno had anything else to say about the enemy or this plan.

However, there was one person that hadn’t thought about her actions, instead chasing after Quinn as soon as he had left and that was Layla.

Following him through the castle, down to the top floor, and was now in the throne room, she could see Quinn up ahead mumbling to himself under his breath.

"Quinn, wait!" She shouted, yet the Cursed faction leader seemed to be in his own world. He continued to go down the floors, making his way out of the castle.

’Quinn, you can’t be the perfect person all the time. You have to let your frustration out sometime.’ Vincent tried to pacify his grandson. ’I was frustrated for many years, living in the vampire society, seeing other people not acting, thinking everything was okay when it wasn’t, but you are not that type of person.’

’You never have been, that’s why you decided to act. I think your frustration comes from seeing no end in sight, but trust me all of this will be over at one point.’

Eventually, Quinn had left the castle. Without any plan where to go, he just headed straight. Vincent’s words helped, but Quinn didn’t know why Eno was just able to rub him the wrong way.

’It’s that look, that look in his eyes whenever he speaks to us. Like he doesn’t care about any of our lives. Does he not care for anyone, but then why....why does he risk so much for humans if he doesn’t care. I just don’t understand!’ Quinn thought.

"Quinn!" Layla called out again, and this time he had heard, turning around, seeing her slightly out of breath from chasing him. Luckily Quinn wasn’t really running otherwise Layla would have never been able to catch up to him.

"Finally." Layla stopped next to him, huffing and panting.

"I just wanted to say, thank you." Layla said, once she had caught her breath back. "I know you said those words because you care about us. You don’t want any of us to risk our lives and trust me we don’t. I’m not sure about the others but I’m sure their thoughts are along the same lines as mine. "

"Even though we are tired, even though we don’t want to risk our lives, at the end of the day, we decided to pick up our feet and continue on. Because if we didn’t then who would take our place. If we don’t protect Blade Island, then who else is there?"

These words were exactly the thoughts that Quinn had time and time again, after making his own faction. It was what kept him going in. If he didn’t change the way the system worked then who would. Who could take his place, and who could stop the Dalki race.

"Thanks, Layla." Quinn smiled. "You know, from the very beginning you have always been there for me, even when I was scared after just having turned into a vampire. Sometimes I need help, and not just with things to do with fighting, and you seem to be there at the right time to pick up the pieces."

Layla smiled back as she started to remember those days. Things seemed so complicated even back then, but now they looked like child’s play in comparison. She would have done anything to go back to that time and just spend some leisure time with each other at school.

As the two of them looked into each other’s eyes, the scabbard that Layla’s sword was in started to rattle. It did so much that Quinn could even see it shaking.

"That sword..." Quinn looked at it. He then remembered something. When he had used his inspect skill on the sword it had triggered one of the Quests.

"Ah this thing, I actually want to ask you about it." Layla remembered, taking it off her side and holding it in her hand. She then pointed it in the direction of the tablet and the sword started to shake even more. "It seems to be reacting to the tablet."

’That’s right, the tablet and the words both activated the quest to learn more about the Talen family. What will happen if I bring the sword to the tablet?’

"Do you mind, if I borrow the sword for a second?" Quinn asked.

Seeing no problem with that request, Layla handed the sword over to Quinn and the two of them headed towards where the tablet was. Hopefully, Quinn would learn more about his Talen family which he still had no clue about. He knew about his vampire side, but what was so special about the Talen name?

However, when Quinn had reached the area where the Demon beast and tablet lay, he saw something else that shocked him even more.

"What the... is that from the little seed I planted?!"

Seeing the tree, the amulet around Quinn’s chest started to react.

*****

# Chapter 1275 - Roseus Tree
When Quinn had defeated the Demon tier beast, he had not only received the crystal from the beast but also other rewards alongside it. One of them had been a little seed. Unfortunately, the system hadn’t told him what the seed was, or what it could be used for.

Due to the lack of that knowledge, Quinn had been cautious about the seed. His first association had been that it was very likely a seed of the tree itself, hence why he had refrained from planting it where there were plenty of people such as on the Cursed ship.

’Calm down, even if that really is a sapling of that damn tree, that’s a good thing, right?’ Quinn tried to stay positive, just like the last time. ’Although I’d rather not have to go through such a tough fight again, I have become stronger since then, so I should be able to defeat it. With another Demon tier crystal we’ll be able to make another Demon tier item.’

However, looking at the Dragon that was snoring not too far from the tree, a horrid thought entered Quinn’s mind. What if the tree was already marking Beasts around the island? The parent tree had the ability to further enhance the power of those Marked. What if it could manage to mark the Dragon? The Demon tier was already strong and with the power of another Demon tier, it would practically be unstoppable!

’Come to think of it, could that really happen? I’m sure the Dragon’s power is far stronger than the tree and if it tries to take over, wouldn’t the Dragon just destroy it?’ Quinn wondered.

Regardless, at the end of the day, Quinn had planted the seed on the island and whatever was to come would be his fault. The tree itself was currently around the same height as two humans stacked on top of each other. It was nowhere near as grand as the original, so Quinn was confident of being able to get rid of it, in case it showed any signs of making trouble, before it would fully grow.

And there was one more concerning thing, the amulet around his neck. Moving forward, Quinn walked out towards it, and just like Layla’s sword that would rattle now his amulet was shaking as well.

’Before I get any closer I should do that.’

[Inspect]

[An incomplete Roseus tree]

[No other information found]

Other than the name of the tree, it looked like the system wasn’t going to help him out now, but he had learned one thing, that it was incomplete.

’Why does the system classify it as ’incomplete’? It can’t just be because it isn’t fully grown. It has to be missing something... has it yet to grow a crystal perhaps? Wait... could it be that it’s somehow unable to?’

Having warned Layla to stay back for now, Quinn handed her the sword back, while he himself inspected the tree from top to bottom. Unable to find anything, he went forward, but since nothing happened, Quinn eventually placed his hand on the tree.

At that moment, the amulet was no longer shaking, rather it lit up. Using his Qi energy, Quinn tried to sense its energy. Unsurprisingly it had the energy of a beast running through it. It was clear this was a beast like the last one, yet he could sense no beast crystal inside.

’The amulet is reacting to it pretty crazy, but maybe it’s just because they both came from the same source.’ Quinn contemplated, yet there was another thought in his head. ’Shouldn’t this be a reward for killing the Demon tier beast? This tree came from the seed I planted, and up until now the system has never given me something that could harm me directly.’

Thinking things through, Quinn used his Inspect skill again, only this time he did so on the Demon tier Amulet. It gave him the same information about the skills and its uses as before but there was one additional line that hadn’t been there previously.

[The Demon tier Amulet can also be used as a key]

It had only come up now after discovering the tree, putting this and the fact that the seed was meant to be a reward, Quinn took off the amulet and was ready to press it against the tree. When it was a few inches away his hand stopped.

’What if I can’t get the key back after putting it in the tree? What will happen to the Dalki in my Shadow lock? Will I no longer be able to use its abilities?’

Considering that scenario, Quinn also thought about the five spiked Dalki that had defeated him. Even if he were to suck all the Marked Dalki dry, the power boost alone would not help him defeat that one. As impressive as Eno appeared in his Blood Armour, Quinn doubted that teaming up with him was enough, either.

With these thoughts he pushed the amulet in, and soon he could feel the amulet being sucked out of his hand, and burning into the tree.

Letting go, the amulet started twisting and turning and lighting up with the tree, and the leaves on the very top started to sprout even more. In front of Quinn’s and Layla’s very eyes the tree was growing wildly, the ground cracked underneath as its roots were digging in, but the amulet could still be seen.

’Damn it, I seem to have made a mistake!’ Quinn bit his bottom lip, but finally the growth spurt stopped. The tree had doubled in size to what it was before, yet it was still inferior to the original.

Turning around, he was worried about the Dragon’s reaction. It had apparently woken up, but for now, he just curiously looked over the tree.

’The Dragon, I woke up the Dragon! Do I have to deal with that as well now?’

After its curiosity was sated, it laid back down and started snoring once more.

’Is that all that thing does?’ Quinn thought. Thankfully the tree had stopped growing and the Dragon was no longer interested in it.

[Inspect]

[Complete Rosesus tree]

[Linking with Amulet is now complete, amulet may be removed]

Seeing the last message, Quinn felt relieved. Jumping up, he reached halfway to the tree, and grabbed onto it with one hand, before pulling out the amulet with the other, and jumping back down to the ground.

With the Demon tier Amulet back in his possession, he noticed that it was radiating with even more energy than before and a system notification on the screen had popped up.

[The Demon tier amulet has successfully been linked with the Rosesus tree]

[The Rosesus tree has become a permanent Marked]

’Permanent Marked? Does it mean it’s different from the Marked Dalki?’

Straight away, Quinn activated the powers of the amulet and he could feel it, just like with the Dalki Quinn could take full control of the tree in front of him. In doing so, he was witnessing a view he had never seen before.

The tree itself had roots that had been implanted not just in the ground beneath them, but the roots spread through the entire island. Using the power of the amulet Quinn could feel what the tree could do, he could control these roots so they would sprout up on the island.

Controlling those roots, Quinn made one of them sprout somewhere in the jungle. He had chosen a thin one which sprouted from the ground in what appeared to be a Basic tier beast’s burrow. Slowly creeping up to the bunny like creature, the root quickly wrapped around the beast.

This was a completely different feeling from controlling the Dalki, as they had at least been humanoid, yet for some reason it felt easier to Quinn. However, controlling several at the same time proved to be a completely different story. The vision of the tree itself was as wide as its roots would go, but to focus on small details was a headache, as he had to try and ignore the rest of his vision which wasn’t something easy to do.

With the roots wrapped around the bunny, Quinn was about to let the beast go, until he could feel something else, that it wasn’t the only thing the tree could do.

’No this feels the same... it feels just like when I mark the Dalki with the Amulet!’

Putting it to the test, Quinn attempted to mark it, and a surge of energy went though the bunny. A few seconds later the same marking appeared on the rabbit’s underbelly. Through the tree, Quinn could control the Marked just how he would when he was using the amulet.

In a way it was like having a second amulet, only better, for there was no need to store energy, it was using the energy of the tree itself.

After a few more tests with the tree Quinn realised something else. The tree could do essentially everything that the Demon tier beast had been able to. Mark beasts, send energy from them and take energy away. The beasts wouldn’t die either when energy was taken away.

Still, he had quickly noticed that with every marked beast, the energy of the tree would lessen a little. The way this worked, it would have never been able to take over the Dragon, not that Quinn would ever dare to do so, afraid of its retaliation.

Eventually, Quinn returned to himself, having discovered that the tree worked pretty much the same way as all his other Marked. The only downside he had found was that he couldn’t use the amulet to directly control those that the tree had Marked. However, he could still give the bunny basic instructions like he did with the Dalki. For now, he just gave the tree the command to try and take over as many strong beats as it could on Blade Island.

’Whoever comes here, will now be in for a huge surprise.’ Quinn grinned, as he imagined the invaders having to face an army of wild beasts!

# Chapter 1276 - A Mistake
Underneath the Blade castle, both Vorden and Raten were sitting inside one of the cells. At the moment, the two Blade siblings were busy consuming crystals, one by one, impatiently waiting for the energy to be consumed by their bodies that would hopefully allow them to evolve to the next tier.

Both of them were sitting on the ground, and had a small mountain of crystals next to them. According to Muddy and Tails, the easiest way for their bodies to absorb the energy inside those crystals was just to eat them. However, the downside was the drowsy feeling they would experience as their body was using that energy to grow.

This was why they had decided to do it underground, away from any distraction of beasts or others and even if someone did come down, they would have to go through the cell doors first. To do that, they would have to pass Borden, who acted as a bodyguard for the two of them.

Since there was no sign of anybody, Borden had just watched the show of Vorden and Raten seemingly competing in an eating contest. After consuming a crystal, both had their eyes closed, making it seem as if they had gone to sleep after overeating.

Technically, evolution wasn't the only way for the two of them to get stronger in their current form. Although beasts were unable to activate most beast gear because of their body, there were some special crystals that could be made into beast gear for beasts… Unfortunately, they were so rare that the group hadn't come across any so far.

Still, around Tail's waist there was a pouch that would allow Vorden to carry a few things around. The only thing currently inside was the green injection for little Borden to use his full strength whenever it was needed.

It was almost impossible for Borden to carry them himself so he did need to rely on others for that part. Still, he was happy that he could help out. Walking up to Vorden's pile of crystals, Borden grabbed onto one of the crystals.

'Dalki are half beast, right? So if I eat this thing will it help me grow stronger as well?' Borden wondered. He quickly disregarded this thought, despite how much he wanted to take the bite of the crystal for two reasons.

The first was that it was his job to protect the other two. If the crystal worked on him in a similar fashion like it did for the two before him, then he would enter a weak state like them, so now wasn't the time to be testing things.

The second reason was just common sense. If crystals really helped the Dalki race evolve, then they should have already been consuming them by now, Borden was sure they would have done the test for it.

'I better just give this crystal back to them.' Borden thought, as he went to put the crystal in Vorden's hand so he didn't have to grab another one from the pile.

It was at that moment, that he could see something coming from above the cave slowly moving. Most wouldn't have noticed, but Borden did.

'What is that?' Borden thought, and immediately started to go for Vorden's pouch, carefully grabbing the injection.

"What's going on?" Vorden asked in a sleepy tone.

Injecting himself, the green energy was rising inside of him and his body started to grow until he was as big as his sleepy brothers. Reaching his full size, Borden quickly threw out both of his hands, and grabbed onto the objects that were moving.

'What are these? Hang on, are these… tree roots?' Borden was confused.

Surprisingly, the roots were not only durable but also very strong. Borden had only just finished his transformation, yet they were easily able to lift him up, swinging him to the ground right into a pile of crystals.

This caused both Raten, and Vorden to come to their senses, and they both stood up.

"You little twerp, I thought you were meant to stop anyone from coming inside!" Raten shouted in anger.

"They're coming from above!" Borden shouted, as the two looked up, they could see several roots hovering in the air, yet Borden noticed that they seemed to be ignoring him, instead they seemed focused solely on the direction of his siblings.

Quikly, Borden jumped up, and grabbed on to two of the roots again, hanging like a monkey on the vines. Using his strength, he tried his best to pull on the roots as hard as possible but no matter how hard he was pulling it didn't seem like it was breaking.

'What the hell kind of tree is this?!'

———

Meanwhile, Layla had just handed over the black sword to Quinn once again, who stood a few steps away from the tablet. Before he could reach the tablet, he suddenly felt the amulet around his neck connecting again.

'I can feel the tree… is it struggling with something?' Quinn wondered. Curious what could have happened, Quinn decided to take Full Control over the tree again. Since the tree was busy in more than just one place, it took the Vampire Lord a while to find the reason for his amulet reaction.

'Crap, stop, stop!!!' Quinn thought to himself. The underground roots retreated, as he made them go elsewhere. Exiting his Full Control, he went back to Partial Control and made sure to convey that the two of them were their allies, forbidding the tree for marking them.

'Well, that was definitely a big mistake on my part.' Quinn blamed himself as he put on a guilty face. It was his own fault for giving the Rosesus tree the simple command of trying to take over as many strong beasts on the island as it could. With the Dragon next to it, he had kept in mind to exclude it from that list, but he had forgotten about Vorden and Raten.

'Look, I didn't do it on purpose. It's just because I never saw those two as beasts in the first place, I just always thought of them as people like the rest of us.' Quinn thought, speaking to Vincent who he imagined was judging him at this point. Just to be on the safe side, he also designated Layla and the others as allies to prevent something like that happening in the future.

Putting this short episode to the back of his mind, Quinn walked the last steps forwards, until he stood directly in front of the table, the black sword in his hand. Layla wasn't too far behind him, curious to see what would happen.

Unafraid of the tablet, Quinn pressed his hand against it.

"Hey… hey are you there? You can still hear me, right? Last time you just stopped speaking to me, but I know something is up with this sword. It seems to be reacting to the tablet, or probably you and I know that it's also somehow connected to my Quest…" Quinn continued to mumble, in the hopes of receiving an answer.

The tablet started to light up brightly once again, just as it had done in the past when Quinn had touched it before. Finally the voice inside said something.

"Yes, I can hear you. It appears that you have brought something that is quite troublesome with you." The voice didn't seem too pleased about the sword in Quinn's hand. As for Quinn, he wasn't in a position to overly care about yet another disembodied voice, he just wanted to complete the Quest, if only to learn more about his Talen family line.

"A quest, you say? Now, that's something I haven't heard in a long time. What type of quest are you on? Who has told you to bring this sword to me? I mean, with the way I am now I can't exactly do anything about it. …was it that damned woman again?" The voice on the tablet started to ramble.

When learning that all of the abilities came from the tablet, and it was from this great being that lived in the tablet, Quinn thought that perhaps he was some type of god, but the more he listened to him the more it sounded like a normal person like everyone else.

He also thought there was a simple misunderstanding. Quinn was referring to the Quest his system had given him, but it sounded like the one in the tablet thought someone had sent him on a quest.

"Look, I really don't know how long I can speak to you for. Last time we were cut off before I could even ask you the questions that only you might be able to answer, so we need to hurry this up. I can tell this sword isn't a beast weapon, so just what is it? What does it have to do with my Talen family?"

There was silence from the tablet for a while. Quinn was starting to worry that the connection had disappeared once more.

"Can you hear me? I need to know more about the sword, or at least about my family. Please, you might really be the only one to help me with that." Quinn pleaded, since that person had been the only lead he had in that direction.

"Yes…I know about the Talen family… and I know about the sword as well… I suppose it's better if I start from the beginning. My original name was Sen."

Quinn was happy that the voice agreed to his request, but he didn't have time for any long winded life stories, not when he was worried that any second now the connection would break off just like it had done the last time. To be frank, Quinn could care less about the name of the one inside the tablet? He just needed to get answers to his questions, so why start from the beginning.

"I say my original name, because my story is a bit special. To be more precise I was reincarnated into a human and I bore the name given to me by my parents. A name that reminded them of a ray of sunshine…"

'Come on already!' Quinn was about to shout in anger.

"They gave me the name of Ray Talen."

*****

# Chapter 1277 - Ray Of Hope

Layla was left standing there not really knowing what to do as strange things were happening around Quinn. One moment she saw the amulet light up around his neck and the next second the tree started to grow in size, without him explaining anything to her.

However, judging by his reaction it was only because Quinn was just as surprised by the consequences of his actions as she was. The next moment, Quinn seemed to be concentrating extremely hard.

"Don't worry about Quinn. He's just playing with the tree for a little bit and should probably be back soon." Vincent turned around, informind Layla: It had become a natural thing for the two of them to switch whenever Quinn would use his Full Control.

'There he is again, the same person as last time. I can tell that's not Quinn, but then just who is it? I doubt Shiro planted someone else inside Quinn's mind, so does that mean there has always been someone else inside his body?' That thought saddened Layla, not because it would mean that Quinn was in a situation similar to that of Vorden, Raten and Sil, but the fact that he had decided to keep it a secret even from her. Even though she couldn't have helped him in any way with it, it would have been nice if he could have confided in her.

Layla was about to ask that mysterious person who he was, but then the real Quinn appeared in front of her asking to borrow the sword once again.. Not having any reason to refuse him, she handed it over and without explaining anything he started to walk towards the tablet.

'Quinn, why do so many strange things happen around you? There're many people who believe the world revolves around them, that only their life is important, but when I watch you… it's as if I realise how unimportant my own life is in comparison. At the moment, the whole world really does seem to be revolving around you.' Layla thought, as she rubbed her elbow up and down with her hand.

A few moments later, the watch around her wrist started to vibrate, indicating that there was an incoming call.

"Hey Layla, thank God, you answered." Sam said from the other side. It was clear he was worried about something, making Layla think that the attack might have started, which would probably be the worst timing with Quinn out of it once more.

"Are the two of you okay, have you been attacked as well?" Sam asked.

"Huh? No, we're both fine, we're just by the tablet at the moment. What's going on, who was attacked and by whom?"

"It's the Blades. They came back to report that while they had been underground they had been attacked by some roots. I tried to get in contact with the others, but fortunately they seem to be the only ones who have been attacked so far."

When hearing the words roots, straight away Layla's mind went to the giant tree in the middle. The timing of the attack, and when Quinn was messing around with the tree seemed to be quite similar.

"Are they okay now, they're not being attacked anymore, are they?" Layla asked.

"No, but they have decided to move away from the underground cells and into the castle. So their session has been delayed a little." Sam explained.

"I think it might have something to do with Quinn.' Layal saad thinking back to the time before the tablet. "There should be no need to panic, but I'll ask him once he's done." Layla said, hanging up the call there.

Layla's answer had only added to his confusion.

'When he's done? When he's done with what exactly?'

———

Listening to the voice in the tablet speak, Quinn was sure of it. It had just claimed that its name used to be Ray Talen, the same family name that Quinn currently had himself. Now, the Quest was starting to make sense, but the only thing was, nothing else was making sense to him.

"Ray Talen… so that means we're related, right? But how? I thought you were some sort of God that gave all the world their abilities? How is that possible? Is my father a God? Does that make me a god as well? But I'm a vampire!" Quinn's reaction to this sudden information was to blurt out a bunch of questions.

In all honesty, he had been through some pretty crazy things before as he learned about his vampire side of his family, learned about Eno's past, learned about Arthur and Vincent, but this information was one thing that made no sense in his head at all. In the first place, his family carried the Talen name which had come from his father.

Not the Eno family name, which most likely meant that Quinn's vampire side had come from his mother, but he had no clue that his non-vampire side would also be so special.

"Calm down, boy. Has it been so long that you've forgotten what I said to you last time?" Ray questioned him. "I was a being that was even more powerful than the Gods. Still, the fact remains, that before I reached that point, I did live my life as a human."

"My parents, although I carried their blood, my own existence and powers continued inside of me, my body changed and I eventually passed that on. It must have eventually reached you. When I asked your name last time, I realised that this had to be the most likely reason as for why the two of us are able to talk."

"Please take note that we are talking about a few 1000 years between my generation and yours, so don't ask me if I know your mother or father, I can already predict your next question."

If Quinn and Ray really were related in some way, then it would make sense why his family also had no clue about this. His mother or their mothers for so much time had passed. Still there was one thing that was on Quinn's mind. If this person wasn't a god, then what was he?

"What… exactly were you? It's already hard for me to even imagine how great a God would be, but then what is greater than that?" Quinn asked.

"I was once feared all over the land. Humans would tell their children about me, the Unstoppable Great Red Dragon Sen! Ga,ga,ga!" Ray started to let out a weird laugh, one that sounded as if it belonged to a beast more so than a human.

'What the hell is going on, Vincent?' Quinn asked, hoping that he wasn't just going crazy.

'Unfortunately, I'm as lost as you on this one. Perhaps you should ask Ray for a bit of context.' Vincent suggested.

"So, you were something above a Demon tier beast? Should I picture you like a red version of the Dragon guarding this tablet then?' Quinn asked.

"Please, do you really think I was that weak?" Ray replied in disdain. "Not to belittle my scaly friend on the outside, but do you really think someone like that could grant nearly all the abilities that exist today?"

"Alas, as powerful as I was, I had been tricked. I was taught a harsh lesson, you see. Someone had wished for me to help the humans but as Sen I had remained stubborn, so they made me live life as a human and through that I learned to care for them. Ultimately, I ended up doing just what was wanted of me, and to my shock I did so out of my own volition."

"I am happy to hear that even so many years later one of my descendants is also helping out the human race. I fought hard for this planet, and while I know how heavy that burden is, I'm happy that with you humanity should be in good hands."

For all his newfound enthusiasm, a lot of Ray's words went right through Quinn who he was busy trying to wrap his head around what he really was. If he had Dragon blood and Vampire blood inside of him… did he even have any human blood running through his veins? However, as crazy as everything sounded, Quinn felt like the tablet had no reason to lie.

Dragons, just like vampires were things that should belong in fairy tales, yet they had to have come from somewhere. If the existence of vampires were real, then why couldn't he believe in real dragons as well. Not just some Demon tier beast that stood behind him. He just never thought that he would be related to them.

"So about this sword... it definitely is not a beast weapon, but did it belong to you?" Quinn asked, trying to change the topic to something easier to understand.

"No." Ray answered and this time his voice became more concerned and less playful. "That sword belonged to a dear friend of mine. It helped us on our journey, and it looks like it found a way to help you out on yours as well. However, that sword doesn't have anything to do with our family line."

"Truth be told, I do not know much about it, but I do know that there is someone who might. There is a being that I knew back in the past during my time. She should still be prancing around even today. You might have even met her since she loves to meddle in things."

"During my time she went by Bliss. Seek her out… or wait until she seeks you out. Since you have my blood it should happen sooner or later. I'm sure she will tell you more about the sword."

[New quest received]

[Meet with the Divine being]

'Divine being…is this the Bliss person he was talking about?'

The light on the tablet started to fade again, and Quinn could tell that the time to speak was running out.

"It looks like our time is coming to an end. You have my blood running through your veins, and if you really are a Talen, then the Dalki won't even be worth your time. Just continue to grow, get stronger and evolve. As one of my blood there will be no cap for you. The Talen family is able to go even beyond anyone's expectations, trust me on that."

Hearing these words, Quinn thought of another quest he had received.

[Become something beyond a Vampire lord]

For some reason, after his little talk with Ray, Quinn was feeling more confident than ever. The tiredness he felt before, the defeats he had suffered, he realised that a small part of him had started to give up hope.

It had started to doubt if we could manage to get strong enough to stop them, but now there was a new ray of hope.

*****

# Chapter 1278 - Planned Or Not?
The light from the tablet started to dye down, and Layla could finally see Quinn removing his hand from the tablet. She expected Quinn to look half defeated as so far he had been. Especially based on the faces she had seen him pull while his hand was on the tablet, but instead, she saw a smile on his face.

'Did he find the answer he was looking for?' Layla wondered. Seeing Quinn's smile gave a warm feeling in Layla's heart as well.

'My emotions, they are all over the place. Is it because of the subclass?' Her vampire subclass caused her emotions to be more heightened than usual.

She had experienced this before, sadness, anger, and happiness. All of these emotions would be multiplied compared to before she was turned. But it was also what allowed her to evolve into her other forms. The stronger the emotion, the more strength she had. .

On top of this, she also noticed that the sword she had given to Quinn was no longer rattling. When she was next to the tablet, Layla had attempted to touch it herself. While holding the sword, there was no such effect for her.

'You are a special one, aren't you?' Layla thought, and before she knew it, Quinn was directly in front of her, handing the sword back over.

"I didn't really find out much about the sword", Quinn said. "Just that it used to belong to someone else a long time ago. It looks like you can keep on using it with no worries. Speaking of, have you ever heard of anyone named Bliss?" Quinn asked.

He knew it was a long shot, but Layla and the others did live a life before him, and there was a time when she was at Pure for a good while. Perhaps she had met this person at some point, but soon seeing her shake her head, Quinn realised that this wasn't going to be an easy task.

"Maybe the Divine being?" Quinn asked again, referring to the name the system had given her rather than the one Ray had. Still, Layla shook her head.

Layla found it a bit strange that Quinn was looking for someone after touching the tablet, and she wanted to ask why. Still, he seemed to be in deep thought.

He was thinking about how to complete the next part of the quest. While also a little annoyed that he hadn't received anything for finding out about his Talen family bloodline.

'Is it because I received another quest straight after? Maybe this is like a chain, and I won't get the real reward until I complete the whole thing.' Quinn wondered. More importantly, he needed to figure out how to find this person.

Although Ray said there was a chance she would come to him, why hadn't she done so far? Everyone knew who he was. The Blade's could get to him, so he was sure if someone was looking for him, they would have been able to find him.

"You know, if you're looking for someone, maybe she should ask Logan," Layla suggested. "He has access to military files and more information than we can imagine. I would guess he could find whoever you are looking for, but with just a first name like Bliss, I don't know how much it would help."

It was a good suggestion to make, and Quinn certainly would ask Logan, but he had a feeling it wouldn't work either.

'I have never heard of this Bliss character either.' Vincent said. 'But you have to remember. The person in the tablet said he had lived 1000 years ago. If this is a friend of his, or someone that knew him, then maybe many don't know who this person is.

'However, there are those that have also lived for 1000 of years that might know the answer, and one of them is on this very island.'

'Please.' Quinn almost begged Vincent, hoping that he wasn't suggesting what he was suggesting. After his mood had just picked up again, was he really telling him to see if Eno knew who Bliss or the Divine being was?

'Alright… I guess I can't help it, and I need to talk to him at some point anyway.' Quinn sighed. 'Even if our views or morals are different, our goals are the same for now.'

"Layla, I just wanted to say thanks for being by my side this whole time. Why don't you meet up with Sam, catch up on whatever plans he has at the moment, and then come back to me? There's something else I need to do." Quinn said.

Not wanting to waste any more time, Quinn ran off, heading towards the castle's direction. Judging by the fact that Quinn was heading that way and not speaking to Sam himself, Layla could tell who he was going to talk to.

'I just hope nothing happens between the two of them.' Layla thought, making her way towards the castle herself.

——

It didn't take long with Quinn's speed to find Eno, and it wasn't hard to find him since he had remained at the same place Quinn had last seen him, on top of the castle. His back was facing away from Quinn while Brock was looking towards him.

He knew that Eno knew Quinn was there, yet still didn't turn around, and seeing the red blood armour, Quinn had many thoughts running through his head.

'The blood armour, Eno had it all this time, and the other vampires didn't even know about it. I guess this is someone who even tricked Arthur, someone who he allowed to call him friends even knowing what he did.

'I also can't help but think that this isn't the only thing that Eno is hiding.' Quinn thought.

What stood out to Quinn as well was the crown-like figure on his head. He hadn't seen that before, not even on Arthurs set, and he was sure it wasn't just for show.

"I hope you haven't come back here to give me a lecture because if so, you are better off continuing what you were doing before", Eno replied.

From the castle, Eno had a clear view of what Quinn was doing, and perhaps he had even figured out what was happening, but Quinn knew that he couldn't hear the conversation he had just had. Otherwise he would understand why he was here.

"I wanted to ask you something, something about-'

Just as Quinn was about to ask his question, he saw Brock turn around and look the other way. Quinn also stopped mid-speech because he could hear it as well. He quickly ran to the edge of the castle wall and looked out far in the distance, where the vast blue sea could be seen.

Large giant circles were opening all over the place. They looked similar to the portals that everyone used, but there was no device to activate them. Seemingly they had just opened up out of thin air over the ocean floating there. Not just one but around twenty or so.

The real worry was that they weren't small portals for humans either, and before they knew it. Several spaceships, around ten from each portal, had come through the teleporters. There were so many ships that Quinn couldn't keep count of them, and they were now all moving towards the Blade island.

What stood out about them was they didn't look like Dalki ships.

"How many……how many have they sent to this island?" Quinn said.

"I had a feeling he would go all out," Eno said, looking out still unmoving, but his fist was tense.

"Jim, why do this much?' Vincent thought.

Those in the castle weren't the only ones that had reacted to this. Unexpectedly, even though the ships had yet to reach the island. The Demon tier beast finally looked like it had decided to wake up.

Its heavy feet hit the ground, shaking it slightly as it stood upright, then looking to the sky, it opened its mouth wide before letting out an almighty roar.

Beasts in the trees and birds flew out, scared of staying on the island, and everyone who didn't know what was going on, now knew something was happening.

The roar was so loud that Quinn had covered his ears, and when the sound had calmed, he looked over at the beast.

'No…no, no no!' Quinn thought.

Looking at the teleporter, Quinn could see that it had been smashed into small pieces. He didn't know when, but he could see the giant Dragon's tail moving back and forth next to it, but still a little distance away. He could only imagine it had collided with the teleporter near the tablet.

"That was not what I expected. The beast has never gotten within a certain range of the tablet before, so I thought it was safe even from the Demon tier beast." Eno said. "However, it just means that there is no retreat for any of us. If we want to survive this, then we have to fight all out. With our lives on the line."

There was something inside Quinn that believed, after hearing those words, that the teleporter being destroyed wasn't accidental at all. Eno wanted to end it here, whether the Cursed faction wanted to or not.

# Chapter 1279 - Beast Tamer
In the grand universe where the beast planets were located, the Cursed ship was currently making its way towards the Cursed faction planets. They had been informed that the Earthborn group as well as the Graylash group were already under attack, so they were worried that the Cursed faction would be next.

Unlike in the past, when the Dalki had owned one half of the beast planets circulating around the solar system's sun, while humanity in the other, the balance had shifted to the point that the latter were down to a total of nine planets.

It was hard to decide where it was exactly safe for the humans to travel. In one half of the solar system, the planets that the humans used to own were split into the three sections belonging to the three groups.

The Earthborn planets were situated directly in the centre between the planets of the other two factions. The Cursed ship had left from Planet Caladi, which was located in the Earthborn section and was now heading over to the Cursed faction section, but would have to go past planets that had already been taken over.

They strayed widely from the other planets and wanted to make it so they were a reasonable distance both from the Cursed faction planets and the Earthborn planets.

However, not too long after setting off on their journey, the Cursed ship had been put to a halt, as it had received some devastating news. .

"Miss Megan, we have terrible news!" One of the Cursed members shouted from inside the teleportation room. "The teleporter you told us to keep watch out for, it has gone offline! It's not activating at all. We have performed all the tests to check if it's something on our end… but the result was that whatever happened to the teleporter had to have occured on the other end!"

"Worst case scenario, judging by how abruptly the signal has cut off without any prior warning, the most likely scenario is that it was destroyed!"

Just as the Cursed faction member had reported, the teleporter had gone offline. Just seconds ago, it had been glowing brightly as the portal had been designated the highest priority. Everyone had been instructed to do everything in their power to keep it active, so they could use it as soon as the fighting would start.

Hearing this news, Megan was biting down hard on her nails inside the command centre.

"What do I do? What can we do? Does it mean those guys are in trouble?"

"I'm sure Sam will give us an update on their situation any second now. Let's wait for his response before we decide on what to do next." Chucky tried to calm Megan down, while Shiro nodded in approval.

The two of them got on with each other, since they had seen each other around the school, and they were also currently the ones helping out Megan take care of the Cursed ship while the others were away.

"Even if their teleporter is broken, aren't there other ways to reach them? Like maybe we could ask to use one from the Earthborn group? They should have one that leads to Earth, and then we can fly to Blade Island from there?" Shiro suggested.

"No, we can't." Megan shook her head. "Supreme Commander Sach has put out an executive order that no one is to use that one. Even though Logan had created the jammers, he deems it too risky. Right now, no one is allowed to have active teleporters leading to Earth. The one on Blade Island was meant to be the sole exception to that rule."

"The only way to head back to Earth is through the space station… which is offline."

Even though they might be able to reason with Supreme Commander Sach under normal circumstances, right now he was busy with his own set of troubles. This was also the reason why Megan hadn't called Sam straight back, after all signs pointed to the teleporter being destroyed.

She couldn't risk distracting any of them, if they were in the middle of fighting. Still, Megan did send out a message and if all things were still okay then Sam should hopefully be giving her a reply soon.

"What about Sergeant Nathan?" Chucky asked. "He used to be a Head General, right? Don't you think he could perhaps still pull some strings for us and get that Earth station working again? Besides, depending on how large the forces are attacking Blade island, we could use Nathan's and his group's help anyway."

It was a good suggestion, so Megan got ready to call Nathan, but one thought passed through her head. What about the Cursed faction planets? For now they had working teleporters on their planets, but who is to say the Dalki didn't find a way to outright destroy those teleporters?

Wasn't there a good chance that whatever happened on Blade Island would happen here again? Would it really be alright to have the Cursed ship head to Earth? It would be a long time before they could arrive…

"The decision is up to you. Sam trusted you, so we will go with whatever you say." Shiro tried to encourage her and Chucky also agreed with that.

————

After the almighty roar from the Demon tier beast, everyone was already running towards the top of the castle. It was the perfect vantage point to allow them to see where exactly the enemy was coming from and how many of them there were.

To everyone's surprise, their numbers far surpassed even their wildest speculations.

"I thought that we might have had some time to prepare more." Sam sighed, looking out into the distance. The ships were far away and moving slowly towards them, but it just meant they would soon face an organised and coordinated attack.

Everyone had believed that things would go down just like it had happened on the other planets when the Dalki had invaded, namely that a mothership of some kind would have appeared and sent down Dalki.

However there was one person who was not with the group. Mona stood far out on the sandy beach of the island, looking into the sea.

"Thanks for the little warning." Mona grinned, as she lifted up her pointy hat a little to be able to have a better look. Finally the ships were starting to make their way towards the island.

"These guys really seem to think that taking over Blade Island will be that easy." She smiled, soon throwing off her hat to the side revealing her long braided dark purple hair that almost looked black, apart from when it moved in the sunlight.

Running out on the sand, Mona looked fearless and not for a second did she slow down her pace. Eventually, she leapt into the air, jumping several feet, a height no regular human would be able to reach without top tier beast armour.

After she passed the shore line, there was only the sea below her and it looked like she would crash into it at any second, but then a dark shadow from underneath appeared. Moments before her toes could touch the water Mona landed on a solid white surface.

In the giant sea of water, a small white piece of land had suddenly appeared, and it slowly started to rise higher and higher, and that's when those from the castle could see what it was as well.

"That looks awfully similar to the giant creature that attacked us when we first arrived here… only a little different?" Logan did not remember the beast having white skin, and at the same time its eyes were almost glowing blue. Not only that, but now that it had revealed itself its overall size seemed to have increased a little as well.

Four ships that were headed out front tried to quickly avoid the giant octopus and attempted to go around the side of it. Soon though, they could see large tentacles in its view. Two of them were slammed out of the air, and their ships sank into the sea.

One of the other spaceships had managed to fly out further to the left of the beast, allowing it to notice the creature before the others. Being further back it had managed to avoid the attack, but soon a jet of water, that spiralled out and shot out like a laser hit the ship blowing it up on the spot.

The final fourth ship seeing this was thankful that the beast had chosen not to use its attack on itself, and was hoping to land upon the planet soon. However, that's when he noticed at the last second, running on one of the tentacles, was a female looking human.

When Mona got to the end of the beasts' tentacle, it soon grabbed her, and threw her towards the fourth ship. Using her great strength, she grabbed on to the back, and lifted both her hands. Activating the power of all her beast gear she slammed down causing an explosion by the engine, and quickly jumped back off, allowing the octopus beast to catch her again and place her on the head.

"Unfortunately for you, I owe that Cursed boy, and his grandfather a favour." Mona spoke, seemingly to herself. "As the only one of the former Big Four present, I will make sure that you pay a heavy price if you intend to reach that island."

It was at that moment, Quinn used his Inspect skill, noticing the octopus had clearly demonstrated a speed, strength, size and skills surpassing its former self, yet it looked too similar to the last one to be a different beast.

"Did you really think you were the only ones that knew how to evolve beasts?" Quinn didn't need to turn around to be able to imagine that smug smile that was sure to be on Eno's face.
