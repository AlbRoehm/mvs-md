# Chapter 1960 Astro Man




Seeing how much vampire aura this strange creature had produced was putting Agent 4 on edge a little. The fact was that the drawing for the magic circle was incomplete and if part of it was destroyed then Agent 4 would have to start the process all over again.

'Actually, I don't even know if I could, does it have to be at this exact spot or just this area. I'm sure an attack like that could destory this whole mountain top. I have to be careful.' Agent 4 thought.

Aiming his hand out towards Laxmus, Agent 4's arm started to transform. It broke apart and robotic parts could be seen through the skin. The entire arm soon transformed into what could only be described as a type of electrical canon.

'I was the great creator who invented those Qi guns in the first place, of course, I would keep the best tools for myself.'

What Agent 4 had was similar to the Qi canon that was used at the Pure base, only it was portable, lighter and ingrained in his body. Lighting up, a blast was emitted straight from Agent 4's hand.

It came out in a yellow ball like form, but not just one blast, but several had been shot out at great speed towards Laxmus, who covered himself with his wings as he was hit by each one in the air.

'Time for me to make a move.' Agent 4 thought as he slid down the side of the mountain and leapt off to another ledge. When the smoke from his attacks had disappeared, Laxmus could be seen fine and in one piece.

'Not a scratch on him, but these blasts are made from condensed demon tier crystal energy and Qi. How can it have next to no effect at all. Who is this vampire?' Agent 4 thought.

Several more shots were fired out towards Laxmus, but this time he stretched out his black hand, which started to be encased in red aura. Then with a flick, he hit one of the energy blasts, which was flung away and exploded in the sky.

Now both of Laxmus's hands were covered in the vampire aura, and swinging them out he knocked each of the blasts from Agent 4 away, and started to flap his wings once more.

Instead of going for Agent 4 like he thought, Laxmus dived straight toward the red heart.

"So that's what you were after this whole time!" Agent 4 jumped and his feet started to transform into a similar shape to what his arm was now, and jets of energy came out from the bottom of his legs.

Getting close to where the red heart was, Laxmus reached out with his hand ready to grab the crystal, when a person stood in his way, his skin bright red, and the jets from his legs, burning the rocks underneath him.

Laxmus's hand slammed into the wall pulsating the red aura once again while the crown on Agent's 4's heads started to light up, and blood dripped from his arm and shoulder.

On top of that, all of his skin was now a dark red like colour as the fourth stage of Qi had been activated.

"Although I have exchanged most of my useless human body parts for more useful mechanical body parts, I am still human. Blood is what runs through my veins!" Agent 4 exclaimed, as an unexpected battle for his life was now on the line.

Letting his hands down, his right hand had transformed into the blaster once more, and Laxmus's body continued straight ahead. Bursting forward with the jets from his legs, Agent 4 collided straight into Laxmus's body using one of his hands to hold his shoulder tight and still.

The burst of power from using stage 4 Qi was strong, and in terms of Qi, Agent 4 was nothing to laugh at. He had received his number four position not just because of his brains, but his strength as well.

"Lets see how you deal with this!"

Agent 4 knew that one hand, and the power of the jets coming from his legs, couldn't hold Laxmus for long, but an attack from this distance should be able to do something.

Holding the blaster arm directly underneath his chin, Agent 4 blasted Laxmus from point blank right underneath his chin. His face was completely covered in energy and his hands seemed to weaken as they let go, dangling by the side.

After that, Agent 4 boosted the speed of his legs with the jets as he kicked Laxmus right in the head, sending him crashing into the mountain below.

'I'm not sure if that was enough to take that type of beast out, but after using the stage four Qi, it's incredibly hard to use it again in the same day, let alone in the same fight.'

Flinging rocks up in the air, a disfigured, half melted face of what was already an ugly looking creature, had emerged from the mountain. Agent 4's fears were true.

Changing his other hand, now Agent 4 had two blasters and started to fire away at Laxmus, one after another. Using up all the energy of the demon tier crystal he had stored inside him.

Instead of aiming for his head, trying to finish off the creature like before, Agent 4 was aiming for its wings and legs.

'I don't have to kill this thing, in fact it might be impossible for me to kill it. All I need to do is slow it down, slow it down just enough so I can finish the magic circle, there's only a few more symbols left and I will be done!'

Continuing to fire away, using every bit of energy Agent 4 had, his skin started to revert back to its normal colour, the red was fading and his body felt heavily drained.

There was nothing else that Agent 4 could do, but hope that this was enough to stop it.

———

Before Zero had gone over to the other side where Erin and Peter were, the marking on his head had lit up. This would often happen when a certain someone had chosen to communicate with him, the one that had given the marking in the first place, Immortui.

One of the abilities that Immortui had was the ability to communicate with his dedicated followers, and when doing so the marking would light up.

Due to the marking being on the head of Zero, in the past he decided to wear a cover up, a fake face which covered the marking because it would be obvious when something was going on.

And moments before Zero went over to Erin, he had made contact.

'You have done well so far.' The voice rang in Zero's head. 'But remember my deal has two parts. You have gathered enough souls over this time, and I will soon come over to your side, thanks to you, but there is one more thing you must do.'

'I know… and don't worry, I was already planning to.' Zero replied back as he looked towards Erin.

One of the tasks that Immortui had given him was to kill the one known as Erin, the leader of the dhampirs. However, even if Immortui hadn't asked him, it was something that he would have done anyway.

Because for a while now, Zero had been eyeing up Erin's strength. A lot of Erin's power wasn't just due to her dhampir self, but due to the large amount of Qi she had refined in her body.

With the Qi drain skill, if Zero could get his hands on that, he realised that no one would be able to stop him. At the same time, there was a chance that whatever power Immortui was afraid of, he would come closer to it.

'You always have to be careful with these things, after all, there could be a chance that Immortui will back out of his part of the deal.'

While walking over to Erin, it made Zero think back, think back to when he had first met Immortui. After all, Immortui was a being that was not of this world.

He was stuck in another realm. Although the vampires had made contact, that was due to Richard Eno opening up a portal to the other side a long time ago. Which was why the meeting between Zero and Immortui, the way he had become a dedicated follower was a unique one. Seeing what had happened to him, experiencing what had happened, was why Zero was sure of it, Immortui was able to bring back those that he cared about.

'I will complete the task without fail!' Zero inwardly screamed in his head, as he thought back to that day.

# Chapter 1961 Aftermath Of The First Dalki War




A long time ago, during the first Dalki war, disaster had struck, changing Zero's life forever. Living peacefully at the top of the temple, Zero had continued the traditions of his family.

Teaching all those that came to him the power of Qi. This was where one of his students had been abandoned by his parents. Leo had been abandoned, and just like with all his pupils, Zero had brought him into part of his family adopting him, and he too had taught him Qi.

Looking back, he was unaware that this would be the turning point in his peaceful life. With the Dalki war starting, Zero wished to remain hidden in the mountains away from it all.

However, a mistake, a grave mistake from one of his dearest students had changed everything, showing the world his powers, and allowing for the world to discover them.

That was the point where those that were part of the temple, had been forced to join the war. They had been placed on what was called an orange portal planet to gather crystals from the beasts.

Their life was rebuilt on the planet, but all of that was short lived, when the Dalki had come to attack. There was no help from the government or from the military and in the end, everyone had perished apart from Leo and Zero himself.

At this point and time the peace treaty had just been announced, having been signed with the Dalki. As for where Zero was, he had returned back to the temple, the original temple that was up in the mountains.

On the way to the temple, there was a bridge, it looked old and worn. Walking, Zero dragged his feet.

"A treaty... a f*cking treaty. Force us into a war, and then sign with the ones that killed them!!!" Zero shouted, dragging his feet across the bridge.

As he finally made it to the other side, and pushed the doors open so hard, that they slammed to the side, nearly breaking. Yet there was no one to complain, no one to say anything because the place was completely void of people.

"Luke, Charlie, Sarah, Mantis, Happy!" Zero shouted, and with each name his voice was getting quieter and weaker, eventually falling to his knees.

Tears ran down his face and onto the ground, and with his two hands he started to slam them down.

"What did I expect, that if I came back here, that they would just come back to life! They're all gone, and not a single one of them will be coming back!"

For a second, Leo had flashed into his mind, but he quickly disregarded that person, he wanted to forget everything about him.

Standing up, Zero continued to walk the halls of the temple, the rooms where he would see their smiles. After images of them being so young, then growing so old and learning Qi, the large smiles on their faces, all of it was coming into his head.

For a second, Zero was having a peaceful moment smiling through his tears, but soon after, the images of the very people he was thinking about flashed in his head again, but they weren't happy memories.

It was of their bloody bodies, their lifeless eyes, limbs with large cuts, and some of them, so badly hurt that one couldn't even recognize them.

"My children, all of them, all of them were killed, murdered and what for! For this Treaty?! Why does everyone get to live in peace now, why does everyone else get to enjoy the time ahead, while their lives were cut short, and then there's me. Who is still here doing what? Wasting oxygen on earth. If they're not here then I might as well, I might as well!!" In the hall of the temple, Zero picked up a small blade and placed it at the side of his stomach., Ready to pierce himself and slide it across, spilling his guts and killing himself.

However, as his hand was on the handle, he couldn't move it. At that moment, everyone, he could see them all in the hall, smiling toward him, and reaching out holding onto the blade stopping him.

"Why... why won't you let me be with you, what do you want from me!" Zero shouted once again, and remained in the same position until the sky went black.

In that position several thoughts did come to his mind, and he had finally come to a conclusion, he couldn't leave this world because there would still be regrets, things that he needed to do.

Picking up his sword, and wiping his face away, Zero's face had changed. The deep wrinkles on his head could be seen, and the focus in his eyes were different.

"I know what I have to do."

,m ----

The treaty had only just been signed and a lot of structures on earth were still destroyed, many buildings and such. Causing the military and the people to have temporary accommodations in tents and more.

At the same time, although there were those with abilities that could help. Their abilities hadn't developed much and there weren't so many that it was widespread to everybody.

The headquarters of the military was currently being built, and the military base at the moment was nothing but a large group of tents because of this.

They were to help the builders, scientists, and more with rebuilding the city. The military felt like it was part of their job to do this for the people after they had helped them through the war, everyone had played their part to survive.

The place was well known to the public, as many would come and line up for daily supplies.

The day before, it had rained, causing the ground to become incredibly muddy. Most were wearing boots to combat this. The army was giving out supplies as there were several queues at the stalls set up to give supplies.

However, one person stood out, as they walked through the mud in sandals, ripped clothing and with a sword by his hilt.

"Get to the back of the line and queue up like everybody else!" One of the soldiers shouted.

Lifting his head, Zero's eyes were still the same as before. Focused as if he wasn't looking at the person in front of him but at someone else.

"I want to see the leader, I want to see the Supreme Commander. The person who had decided to send me and my family to that damn planet, bring him out now!" Zero shouted.

It was starting to gather the attention of those around, but they had seen this sight before. It wasn't the first time someone had blamed the military for the many deaths.

They looked at Zero with pity and sorrow, especially seeing him in his current state.

"The Supreme Commander will not just come out to meet someone like you. There is a procedure. You can make your complaint and if there is a need for him to see you he will." The soldier explained.

Not listening, Zero continued to walk forward and as he did he was mumbling. "Bring him out, bring him out!"

"Stand back!" The soldier said, pointing his gun right at Zero. "I will shoot."

Taking a step forward, Zero pulled the sword out of his sheath and slashed the gun, causing half of it to fall into the ground. The next step he kicked the man's leg, popping out the knee and grabbing his head as he fell to the ground, now placing his sword by his neck.

"Bring out the Supreme Commander out now, otherwise, a lot more than him will lose a life, and trust me I have already lost everything that matters to me, so there is no threat you can make that will make me stop."

The soldiers looked at each other, and with no choice, they ran inside. A few moments later, a large muscular man who looked nearly as big as the Dalki had walked out.

"What is this, you are not the Supreme Commander. Do you soldiers not even care about the lives of your own?" Zero asked.

The large man lifted both hands to show that he was no threat.

"The Supreme Commander is currently not present, but I have been sent in his place. I am second in charge around here while he is away."

Looking at the man closely, Zero started to recognise him, someone who had appeared on the TV a few times, as one of the heroes of war, Oscar.

"Please let go of the man, and I promise you, we won't harm you and will listen to what you have to say, I am here for you," Oscar stated.

Hearing this, Zero was inclined to believe him, so he let the man go, who scurried and ran off to the other side.

"Thank you, for doing that, now please tell me what you want, and your name?" Oscar asked.

"My name." Zero replied. "I guess I was once known as Sabre Hunt, but a name is meaningless for me. I am worthless and there is n no one that needs me anymore in this world, I am... Zero."

The words had come out of his mouth unexpectedly, but that was how he felt, like nothing.

"And I have come here, to kill the Supreme Commander."

*****

# Chapter 1962 Zero's Rage




﻿1962 Zero's Rage
The words that had come out of Sabre's mouth, or more correctly Zero's mouth, made Oscar shake his head. He truly was going to listen to the man in front of him, try his best to comfort him, but these words were a direct threat, and that was why the people by the side all lifted their guns pointing them now at Zero.

"Wait!" Oscar lifted his hand. "Put down your guns. There are many that come here, angry, sad and in pain. We shouldn't just disregard it."

Looking at the sliced up gun and how the person was able to take one of the men hostage. Oscar guessed that this man was a talented fighter. Most likely someone who had taken part in the war and had survived just like him.

Sure, there were many people who threatened to kill the Supreme Commander, but not many that had the strength to and this person most likely had the strength.

"Why the grudge, why do you want to kill the commander?" Oscar asked.

"He… He forced my family to fight. He was the one that made the order, and never sent any help when we were under attack! We helped the world, but where was the world when we needed help!" Zero picked up his sword and directly pointed it at Oscar.

"Do you think you were the only one that suffered loss?" Oscar replied back. "Look around you, look at all these people here, who lost family members, lost everything they had.

"This may sound like an excuse, but if the planet you were attacked on was attacked by the Dalki, then probably over 10 other places were being attacked at the same time as well. We were trying to save everyone, everywhere making the best decisions when possible.

"Even I… in this war lost those close to me. We didn't ask for this war, no one did."

Oscar's words resonated with a lot of the people that were queuing up, and looking at the person to the left and right of them, some had missing limbs, or had hardly any clothes on at all.

On top of that, even the soldiers were thinner than some of the people in line, because they had been skipping meals in order to feed those around them, feeling guilty that they didn't do better.

"That makes sense in a world where everyone provides for each other." Zero replied. "But we never asked anything from the world. We lived on our own accord, provided food for ourselves, protected our own, never once asking anything of the government, or of the military.

"But then you forced us, my family, to help you! Then on top of it all, you stopped everything and signed a peace treaty with them, that is something I can not forgive."

Zero moved his blade slightly to his side, and it looked like he was about to make a strike. The soldiers by the side weren't so nervous because Zero was quite the distance away,  but there was a big worry in Oscar's mind.

This man in front of him reminded him very much of one of the Hero's of war, the Blind swordsman, and he had seen the things he was able to do.

Immediately, Oscar placed both hands on the ground, and pillars surrounded Zero like a prison, but with a swing of his blade, the pillars had been slashed in half and now he was running directly toward Oscar, at a speed that looked inhuman.

'My guess was right, he's the same, is there a relationship between the two?' Oscar thought. "None of you get involved, this is my fight! And bring me that!"

The soldiers listened to Oscar and a group of men ran back inside towards the tents, following his orders.

Lifting his hand, Oscar had made a wall of mud, and then out from that wall, solid bricks of earth were being shot out toward Zero.

Seeing these, he started to hit them away, slicing them in the best motion possible, but one of the bricks had hit his thigh, hurting him quite a bit, but Zero continued onward, reinforcing his body with the first stage of Qi.

Rather than striking at the bricks he decided to run around the side instead, but like a turret, Oscar was moving the mound of mud, continuing to fire bricks out and once in a while, they would hit Zero, hurting him but not slowing him down.

'These bricks are coming out at a fast and heavy speed, just getting hit by one usually sends a person falling to the floor. This person is strong.' Oscar thought.

At the same time, Zero was struggling for a number of reasons, one of them being the fact that he had never gone against an ability user before. During the war he had fought just beasts and Dalki.

Sure there were times where he would see an ability user or two, but fighting against one was strange to say the least.

"How will I ever get my revenge, if I'm just running away all the time!" Instead of running around the side, Zero went straight forward moving his hand and slicing the bricks and allowing those to hit him in non-vital areas where he was reinforcing his body.

Eventually reaching the mound of dirt, Zero slashed it twice, cutting up an x shape, then seeing Oscar there, Zero thrust the sword forward, attempting to stab him right in the chest.

At the same time, Oscar had slammed his foot on the ground, and raised a pillar right underneath Zero's foot, creating a platform and raising him high in the air, making his sword hit nothing but the air.

"Crumble." Oscar said touching the earth pillar, and it started to break into tiny pieces. In doing so, Zero was now falling through the air, as he lost his footing. Spinning his body in the air, it looked like somehow Zero was able to slow his descent, making the fall not impact him.

However, Oscar had expected something like this from him. Which is why he had created two giant hands of earth, which were coming to gather for a large clap. The giant earth hands clapped, squashing Zero who was in the middle.

They had hit each other so hard that the earth they were made from started to crumble and fall to the ground, leaving a fallen Zero, to hit the muddy floor.

"Man, I wasn't expecting to see that. Oscar really had to use all his strength." One of the soldiers commented.

"Yeah, and he just showed why he is the best earth user that the military has."

"What about the other guy though, he was clearly strong as well. He said he took part in the war, right? Surely someone like him would have had their name spread and known."

The reason for that was because Zero had never been as flashy as Leo. Leo had taken part in the war, making an impact before the rest of them were forced to fight, and after that incident Leo had stayed in the military fighting the Dalki. As for Zero, he had gone into hiding, not wanting to take part in the war that took everyone away from him at all.

While lying in the mud, Zero's hands were still wrapped around the hilt of the sword, he never let go. Recirculating the Qi around his body, he was causing his cells to go into overdrive repairing what injuries he had.

Then stabbing the sword into the ground, Zero had gotten up once again.

"You're the one I have to beat right? If I beat you, I can get to the Supreme Commander. So I wont lose."

Summoning up all his strength, Zero threw out his sword, and tried to move his Qi with it, as he did a visible strike came out from his sword, making a Qi slash. This was unexpected for Oscar, who lifted an earth barrier but it had cut right through it, only slowing it down a little.

Using the earth he could find, he tried to create a type of armour, but the slash had still hit him, going through the armour, and cutting part of his chest but not killing him.

Oscar, was on one knee, and looked at the man in front of him, the look in his eyes, it was still there, not for a second had the fight been over.

'This man is dangerous, if I don't get rid of him here, he could be a problem for the whole world in the future.'

Just then the men from inside the army camp had returned, and as they did, they were carrying a bag in their hand. Placing it on the floor they opened it up and a large grand sword with three circles was seen inside, it was the demon tier weapon.

'For the sake of the world, I must get rid of you here. I hope you will find peace in your death.'

*****

# Chapter 1963 Never Lie




Immediately, Zero could sense that there was something about the sword in front of him. An energy that he had never felt before that was causing his body to shiver slightly. Even the air in the area had gotten slightly colder.

Now, Oscar had picked it up and it was in his hands.

"I'm sorry to say that I'm not much of a swordsman." Oscar stated. "Perhaps something like this would have been more suited in your hands, but this thing, it chooses its user. Those that it decides to reject, it decides to freeze, and with the way you are right now, if you attempted to touch the sword, I'm sure you would become nothing but a block of Ice."

Holding his sword firmly, nothing had changed for Zero. He still needed to complete the task at hand, and if he was able to produce the strike he had done before again and again, there was a chance he could win this.

Zero ran forward brave and confident, looking out for any use of the earth ability, ready for anything to come his way, apart from Oscar himself, who was suddenly directly in front of him with the large sword.

He had it held above his head, and swung it down crashing right into Zero's.

'I'm using Qi to reinforce my strength. I knew beast weapons improved the user strength by a great deal, but I didn't know it was by this much.'

Zero had no choice but to deflect the energy by skimming the sword and spinning to the side of Oscar, but with the power of the demon tier weapon, Oscar was a step ahead, already swinging it towards Zero again.

The sword barely was able to block as Zero was hit and skidded through the mud. Looking at his own weapon, it was now slightly frozen as well.

'He doesn't even need to be skillful with the sword, nor use his ability, because that weapon does everything for him. He is faster and stronger than me… and this… special property.'

"Now do you understand what I meant?" Oscar said. "I'm sorry but I hope you find peace."

"Why!" Zero shouted. "If a weapon like that was in my hands, were in the hands of my people, we would have been able to protect more. Why didn't the military give us this power!"

Once again Zero swung his weapon and a line of Qi came out, his attack was filled with anger and was stronger than the one before it, but with a swing of his own weapon, it had completely smashed and cut through the Qi attack, causing it to have no effect at all.

Before Zero could say anything else, Oscar used his enhanced self to run directly in front of Zero and slashed diagonally, breaking the sword in half and creating a deep cut on his body.

'It didn't go completely through, it didn't feel like I was completely cutting flesh?' Oscar thought. This was all because of the reinforced Qi that Zero was using. In a life and death situation he was able to summon it more than he imagined.

Still, the blood loss was great, the injury was bad, and he was unsure if he could recover. Most, if not all, of his Qi was used to stop the attack from slicing him in half. For the first time in the fight, Zero realised something, it was impossible for him to win.

With that said, there was no choice for him, with the broken part of the blade, he threw it towards Oscar who had blocked it. It gave him a few seconds but Zero was seen running away, trying to head back into the woods.

"I'm sorry, but as I said, I can't let you live." Oscar pointed the sword toward Zero, and the first ring started to light up. Out from the sword, a tunnel of ice shot out heading towards Zero.

Hearing the destruction it was causing, Zero attempted to step to the right, and the ice tunnel had skimmed past his hand, just brushing him ever so slightly. As that happened, the ice started to spread from his hand, growing quickly, now covering up to his elbow as he continued to run away in the distance.

"Should we keep chasing him sir!" the men asked.

"No, the important thing we need to do is clear the area until the ice melts and make sure no one touches it." Oscar replied. "Besides, once someone has touched the ice it will grow and bind their entire body."

Zero continued to run through the woods, but he was noticing that the ice was slowly covering his entire body. He was feeling faint and weak as his wound hadn't healed up either.

In the end, it had covered his entire arm, and eventually Zero had collapsed to the ground, even before the ice had covered all of himself.

'Is this it… is this how I die in the end? Not being able to do a single thing for the people I care about. I wasn't even brave enough to take my own life.' Zero started to sob in place.

Honestly, with how much his vision was fading, he wasn't sure which one he would die of first, the blood loss or the ice, and in the end he had lost all of his vision.

As that had occurred though, a voice had reached out to him.

"A strong willed soul is a rarity among you humans." The voice said. "It seems that you truly still do not want to come to this side."

"Where am I… who are you, what is this voice, am I dead?" Zero asked.

"Dead… it is hard to say. I would say that your body has already died, but a part of you remains stuck on the plane of earth. However, no matter how hard you try to resist, after people die, they always will come to this side… and come to me.

"Tell me why do you resist so much?"

"Why… I… I want to see them." Zero replied. "I want to see their faces again, I want to be with them. I'm their father, their teacher. I should have never died before them!!!"

"You wish to see people who are already dead… I see now, you don't wish to be with them, you don't really care about that, otherwise you would have taken your own life, but you wish for them to live on and live a fuller life.

"What if I told you I can help you?"

"Then I would say that you were just a delusion, something my brain has created in my final moments."

"Even if you believe that is the case. What if there is a chance that this isn't all made up? That everything I'm about to tell you is real, that I can bring them back to life, bring them back to earth."

Zero was almost certain that this was a dream, a dream before his death, and he was just hearing things he wanted to hear, but there was a small spark that had been ignited, a 'what if this was real'?

"Go on, humour me, tell me what you want?"

"I will save you first, but in return you will be a follower of mine. There are a number of things that I will need you to do, and as long as you complete them, I will bring them back for you."

Zero started to laugh, of all the times to be offered such a thing.

"Where were you before, why are you only speaking to me now?"

"Because, I can only speak to those that are in your situation. Those that are practically dead already."

"You sound like the devil." Zero claimed.

"Haha, I have heard of this devil you humans speak of, but trust me, I go way beyond what you can imagine. The world isn't as small as you think."

"Fine!" Zero shouted. "I don't care what you are, but I will do as you ask of me, and no matter what it takes, or how long it takes, I will bring them back. You better keep your part of the deal."

"I never lie."

These were the last words that Zero heard, and opening his eyes his vision had come back and a rush of strange energy was felt inside him. A burning sensation could be felt on his forehead.

Looking at his arm, the ice started to crack, breaking completely and falling to the ground. The wound on his chest was healing up. Not only that but something he hadn't noticed until now, his heart was starting to beat.

"I… my body… it was really dead. That means I came back from the dead. That wasn't a dream, a delusion… If that's the case then it means the deal I made was real. I can really bring them back!"

Standing up on his two feet, that was when the real Zero was born.

******

# Chapter 1964 The End Of Zero's Story




For some reason, the past had resurfaced in Zero's mind. Maybe it was because he was close to achieving his goal, maybe it was because he could see that dreaded weapon in the ground.

The one that had nearly taken his life, either way those days were soon to be behind him, as he had one last thing to do. There were no more requests, this was it.

Pretending to swing the sword towards Peter, Zero then swung it behind him, as he aimed right for Erin's neck. He knew about her ability, because he knew a lot about Leo as well. She was able to sense any kind of energy fluctuation, allowing her to predict when an attack was coming before it did.

Which was why, with this strike, the only thing Zero used was the first stage of Qi to enhance the strength of his muscles and only that. He condensed his Qi down, focusing on not making it move a tiny bit, and swung the sword.

A fast swift movement with no hesitation, a move that was detached from Zero's mind. That was the type of sword strike he had made. It was perfect, the move was done so well that Erin hadn't even noticed the sword coming toward her.

As it inched closer and closer to her neck, Zero had to make sure to contain his excitement, because Erin had her demon tier armour that allowed her to phase through any type of attack.

As long as she wasn't startled or it was too sudden, she wouldn't activate it. When the sword was brushing up against her skin, it stopped.

'Why… why has the blade stopped!' Zero didn't understand, he could see no reason why his sword would be stopped, he couldn't sense any Qi from Erin, but a moment later, purple sparks started to appear.

With no choice, Zero had to put Qi into his blade to push through whatever it was stopping his sword. The purple sparks grew larger, still not allowing his sword to move an inch.

"I didn't expect any less from you." Erin smiled.

A sharp pain could be felt from below, and when Zero looked down he could see large claws from something that was out of this world having pierced right through his stomach.

'My Qi… I suppressed it… and didn't keep it up, all in order to do my surprise attack.' Zero thought.

Before pulling his sword away, he felt something land on his head, and was soon on his arm. It was a black cat, which erupted into flames, and in doing so it started to burn Zero's right arm.

Standing up and grabbing her sword, Erin took two steps away, far enough so Zero would have to move if he wished to strike her, and that's when, from her shoulder, something started to grow. It was a black and purple dark skinned turtle that started to grow in size.

The black cat was on her shoulder, and the Boneclaw with blood on its claws was standing next to her as well.

"When agreeing to work with you, I thought this might happen," Erin said. "Which is why I had already summoned the Kings. To protect me if any dire situation were to occur."

The familiar kings had acted on behalf of Erin, protecting her life. The Turtle Genbu had shrunk so small, staying on her shoulder. It had blocked the sword strike from Zero with its hard shell.

The Boneclaw had teleported behind Zero, stabbing him right through the stomach, doing more damage than Erin could have hoped for, all because Zero was doing his best to sneak an attack on her.

"Without them your attack probably would have worked, or maybe not. I can tell you are already extremely tired from the two fights from before. There was a reason why I didn't get so involved when fighting that, what were they called, celestial?"

Both of them had been doing the same thing to each other, trying to weaken the other one down. The only thing was, Zero didn't realise that Erin was doing the same thing, he had underestimated her power and strength.

The wound on his stomach was quite bad, and Erin was right, a lot of Qi had been used up in the fight with the celestial and Chris, who was a harder opponent than Zero had imagined.

"You think this is the end!" Zero shouted, as his head started to light up and a black substance started to appear from the marking.

In that moment, the Boneclaw teleported right to Zero's side and using its large claw, it slashed his wrist, causing Zero to drop the sword. It was laying there on the ground, but what was worse, was the fact that Erin had already stabbed the large great sword right through Zero's chest.

Ice was starting to form around the wound, but blood also filled Zero's mouth. The marking on his head started to fade and the black substance that was coming out, began to retreat.

Standing by the side, AJ had captured everything on camera, it was all being filmed live. He couldn't believe the turn of events and had to explain to everyone that just moments ago these two were working together. For this to suddenly happen, he didn't understand why.

What was the reason behind it? It was clear that Zero was the one that had attempted to attack Erin first.

"What is happening!" Vannesa asked. She looked to Flora, who was still a prisoner by her side.

"Erin always thought this would happen." Flora answered. "She told me, before we went on this trip, to be prepared. Why else would the leader of Pure ask just us and him to go on this trip?

"That old man, he probably thought his tricks worked on everyone, but Erin can't fail. She has more determination than anyone to complete her goal!"

"To rid the world of all vampires." Lucas quietly said. "Honestly, I don't know who I would rather have lived in this situation."

——

Zero, had felt this feeling once before, his body feeling weak, his vision fading, and the wound around his chest was cold. Looking down he could see the same dreaded weapon as before. The one that had nearly taken his life before, was taking his life once again.

'I… know I can't go on anymore. Everyone… I failed you again. I just wanted to see all of your faces, one last time. I just wanted to do anything possible to spend an extra second with you.

'And now… I've failed. What does that mean? All of the lives I had taken, all of their faces, all of the people's lives I ruined, were all for nothing in the end. I became a monster… and all for nothing.

'Leo… I'm sorry for blaming you, I'm sorry I was unable to step in back then, and most of all I'm sorry I couldn't kill this b*tch that took your life. I… might see you, but in truth I don't deserve to see you, I don't deserve to see any of you after what I have done, but maybe that is just the sin that I know I have to live with.'

Turning his head slightly to the side, his vision nearly completely gone. Zero could faintly see Chris.

'Live the rest of your life how you want, following what you believe… don't become like me.'

With one hand firmly on the sword, Erin then used her other hand and placed it right on top of Zero's head.

"I don't want to kill fellow humans, but I will get rid of anyone that tries to stop me, and I want to let you know, you are going to help me."

Suddenly, Zero was a feeling something from deep within his stomach get pulled out from him. His skin was started to shrivel up. Everything was flowing and moving out from the top of his head and was being passed onto Erin.

Zero knew straight away what this was, it was the Qi drain skill, the skill that he used on many people before. A skill that drained the life Qi out of someone, adding his inherent power to hers.

With this, not only was Erin getting all of the Qi that Zero had, but all of the hundreds of thousands of lives that he had taken. With this, without a doubt, Erin would now be more of an unstoppable monster than before.

Letting go of Zero's head, he fell to the floor, a shrivelled up corpse, unrecognisable compared to what he was.

"This is where your story ends Zero."

# Chapter 1965 Acting When Necessary




The energies in the celestial world were quite literally all over the place. Those watching from the space all had conflicted views at what they had just seen. Those that knew the one killed was a follower of Immortui, thought that he might try and act out against this god slayer.

The problem was, how would Immortui do such a thing in the first place, since he was restricted from crossing over?

Others feared something else, that the god slayers from Earth were becoming a bigger problem. That they might be utilised to fight against them and there was a chance that they would have to start a reincarnation cycle.

A lot of celestials enjoyed controlling the lives on their planets, some were even doing so in a happy way. However, they would have to listen to whatever the request was in the end.

"What do you think?" Yongbu asked. "It was strange that a dedicated follower and god slayer were working in the first place, so I predicted this might have happened, but for the god slayer to win and obtain the other's power, isn't this a really big deal?"

The one Yongbu was asking, was the trustworthy or untrustworthy at this rate, Xox. He had been getting a lot of predictions wrong lately and this was even causing his ball to spin.

"Why do you keep asking me for my opinion?" Xox complained. "I mean I have many theories, I just don't speak them all. So I am right some of the time."

Yongbu was looking around to see if there was anyone else to talk to, when he leaned in.

"I'm not so comfortable talking about the god slayers from earth." Yongbu whispered.

Because he had helped out one of them. It was a fact that if got out, he might get killed by his very own fellow celestials.

"Fine, my guess is we still have nothing to worry about yet." Xox answered. "I think… unless we see Mundus act, which he hasn't done yet, then we have nothing to worry about… he has things sorted."

The truth was, Mundus was watching everything carefully, debating what to do, but because he was so focused on the fight that was going on, much like the other celestials, they had all missed something large happening on the planet.

———

Agent 4 had used up all of his energy and Qi shooting towards the strange creature that had suddenly come out of nowhere at him. He thought his task was an easy one after reaching the mountain and not getting attacked by beasts on the way, but it proved incredibly difficult.

'The demon tier crystal's energy ran out as well. I have a demi-god tier crystal as a reserve, so I can still use that.' Agent 4 thought as he flew over with his legs jets to where the red crystal currently was.

With the special chalk in his hands, Agent 4 was ready, and started working away, writing the last few of the symbols. He was being as quick as possible, when suddenly he could feel the mountain shaking slightly.

"No… I knew it probably wasn't enough, but what am I meant to do… Do I just run away and leave the crystal? That is what it's after, right? So I will be fine, but if Zero ever found out, then he would have my head rolling off this mountain quicker than I could think.

"Right about now, he should be going through with the plan and absorbing that Dhampir Queen's energy, and then he will be unmatched in this world. Even if he was to go up against that damned Hero Quinn."

Blasting through the rocks, and up into the air, was Laxmus, but there was some success to what Agent 4 had done. There were a few holes in his wings making it difficult for him to continue hovering in the air.

In fact, Laxmus had quickly fallen back onto the ground as he could no longer use his wings properly.

"That will slow him down, but I know that thing won't give up. It's like a damn unstoppable zombie!"

With the piece of chalk, Agent 4 was making sure he didn't do any of the steps wrong. Otherwise, it would all be for nought, yet he was rushing at the same time. Two things that didn't tend to go well together, not in his line of work anyway.

The sound of footsteps was getting louder as Agent 4 continued the very last steps.

'Just don't look up, just focus on what you need to do!' Agent 4 said to himself.

When Laxmus reached the top of the mountain, seeing Agent 4 and the red crystal, it opened up its mouth, and started to gather the energy to fire off a beam. It got larger and larger

"That's it… done!" Agent 4 said, lifting his head up and seeing Laxmus about to blast him to death.

"Imprtui desunta!" Agent 4 said, hoping that these words would do something with the circle complete, otherwise he was done for.

The red beam of energy left Laxmus's mouth, as the stream of energy continued, the magic circle started to light up in a red glow. Then from the lines that were drawn, a great energy burst up from them.

Laxmus's attack had hit this energy, but it was doing nothing, and when the attack ended, the mountain, the crystal, everything remained intact.

"It worked… These markings and drawings worked. I can't believe this, just how is this possible?" Agent 4 thought as he looked at what was happening.

The red crystal that was in the centre was starting to shake, left and right, until it was lifted off the ground. In doing so, it stopped moving left and right until it was roughly two metres off the ground.

Then from the Red Heart, a strong beam of energy shot right in the centre of the ground. The light that was being emitted from the crystal was getting larger and larger, until the energy reached the edges of the magic circle.

The power that was coming from the Red Heart was so intense that Agent 4 could even feel his armour reacting, and same with the crown. Without him knowing about it, both of these pieces were breaking down into small little red particles.

When he finally noticed, it was too late, half of the crown had already been absorbed by whatever energy was going into the mountain.

'This armour, is useless without the crown, and it looks like the armour is done for as well.''

The beast that was attacking Agent 4 until moments ago, also didn't seem to be moving closer to the energy as if it knew that it would consume him as well. Right now, Agent 4 didn't know if it was best for him to run away or not, but he was fascinated because right now, he wanted to see whatever it was that was going to come out of that magic circle.

———

At this point and time, the energy had been recognized by one that was watching the fight go on. Sitting in his chair till this moment, Mundus stood up, he started to move his hand and with it the vision he was seeing on the planet started to move as well.

That's when he came across the red heart and could see what it was doing.

"An opening… is this what Immortui planned this whole time? Is that what the dedicated follower was doing? Creating an opening between the two planes. It's... too late to stop this, but why would he do this, is he trying to kill every life on Earth.

"He needs life to be born and to be taken at the same time. Opening a direct path between the two will get rid of all life unless… Immortui, did you not learn your lesson from the last time? Do you really wish to start another war!"

Mundus closed the screen he was looking at, and soon his body was disappearing from the celestial space, because it was time for him to act directly.

*****

# Chapter 1966 Take Your Hands Off




The red heart continued to produce massive amounts of energy and all of it was directed to one spot… where the magic circle had been made, but it was clear that the energy wasn't going through the mountain. Otherwise the whole mountain would have been destroyed.

This amount of energy, Agent 4 wouldn't have been surprised if it managed to hit the planet's core, destroying the whole place, but instead it was going somewhere else.

That's when there was a slight change, the red crystal itself started to break down, now turning into nothing, and sparks started to appear from the outer circle. The red barrier that came from the light of the magic circle had disappeared but the energy beaming from the crystal was still present.

Seeing this, Laxmus started to move in, because there was no longer anything blocking his way like before.

'Should I stop him? Whatever is going on, whatever is happening, it doesn't look like it's done yet.' Agent 4 chuckled at the thought, because there was no way he could stop that monster now.

When getting closer and reaching a hand out though, coming out from the circle was a large tentacle that had several circle marks running on it. The next second, the circle marks opened, revealing eyes. There were hundreds of eyes on the tentacle alone. They moved about looking at everything around it, and suddenly stretched out from the circle, and wrapped right around Laxmus's arm.

Using his great strength Laxmus tried to pull away but it was still able to drag him. Seeing how this wasn't working, it started to flap its wings and finally Laxmus was winning in the tug of war, as he was pulled back partly.

However, two more strange tentacles came from the magic circle and grabbed onto Laxmus. It was able to pull him in again, closer to the circle.

Seeing no other option, Laxmus opened its mouth and the red beam attack started to gather. Looking down it unleashed the red beam, burning the entire circle with the vampire energy.

Moving his head, he managed to burn off the other tentacles that were attached to him as well, and he was finally free, or at least he thought he was. Moments later, the tentacles that had been burnt and partly cut off, were regrowing, and strangely even more eyes had appeared on these parts.

Then, more tentacles started to grow from the tentacles, branching out like some strange tree, and monster. Each one of them latched onto Laxmus, covering every part of his body, wrapping around him completely.

'I think I've made my decision, it's best to get out of here for now.' Agent 4 thought.

———

Looking down at the person in front of her, Erin couldn't believe it. How much energy she was feeling going through her entire body.

"This old man, he stopped relying on his skill, improving his own powers and just relied on absorbing others, but I can see why he did so." Erin thought as she closed her eyes, feeling every bit of Qi in her body, it was beyond amazing.

While using her ability, she sensed that there was another powerful Qi energy that was on the field. With a single jump off her leg, she soon landed right in front of Chris. Who was still breathing and his heart was still beating but he appeared to be passed out still.

However, the presence of someone next to him had jolted him awake as his eyes opened wide, and of all people he didn't expect to see her in front of him.

"What… happened?" Chris faintly asked.

"I did what you couldn't." Erin replied. "That old master of yours is now gone."

Due to his groggy state, it was taking a while for Chris to process what Erin was trying to say, but he soon realised that if Erin was here, then it meant his companion Peter had also lost his fight.

Turning his head to try and see if he was okay, there was another sight that Chris saw instead, a shrivelled up corpse that somewhat resembled his old master. He didn't know why, but tears and a strange pain could be felt In his chest as he saw this.

"I can't believe you still have feelings for such a person still. Didn't you already resolve to kill him, I guess it just wasn't strong enough." Erin said as she got closer, but Chris was unable to move his body.

Other than his head, nothing else seemed to be listening to him and now that Erin had grabbed onto it, he was unable to move that as well.

"Wait, don't tell me, is she going to do the same to Chris as she did to that Zero guy!" Vanessa shouted.

"I think your right, we have to do something?" Lucas said, still holding the blade. With the sword, he thought he might be able to stop her, but his legs weren't moving. Although the thing that stabbed Zero was no longer on the field, it seemed like it could appear as it wished.

In the end, all of them were far too afraid to act, and they all thought it was pointless.

As expected, Erin had started to use the Qi drain skill on Chris as well. Just like before, energy was being transferred from him to her through her hand. Not only that, Chris was one that had a large amount of Qi, bigger than most and as she was draining his life away, she felt almost like a god.

'I don't need to fight against vampires anymore to get a boost. The amount of power that I have received from these two… is enough to take on anyone.' Erin smiled as she let go.

Although the same thing had been done to Chris, his body was intact, he looked weak, his muscles smaller than they were before, but he was still breathing.

"I have taken almost all of your energy, you may never fight again, but you will live. Be thankful that you're not a vampire, and I wasn't the one you fought." Erin stated, as she looked around again.

That's when she noticed that there was a third Qi source, not as large as Chris's or Zero's, but still large enough to make her power grow even more. Jumping up again, she landed directly where Peter was.

He was lying on the floor on his front, just like Chris he could move his head and looked at Erin.

"Your life will not be spared. You are a spawn of the vampires, so there is a high chance that you will act just like them." Erin placed her hand on the back of Peter's head and then lifted him off the ground.

He was unable to move, his energy also having gone, and his hunger at a point beyond what he had felt before. Still, in this situation, Peter smiled.

"Look at you," Peter said. "I can't believe we went through so much trouble trying to protect you from Jack Truedream. We should have just let you die back then."

With all the strength Peter could muster up, he spat out a bit of blood that was in his mouth landing right on Erin's cheek.

Activating the Qi drain skill once again, the energy could be felt moving from Peter, into Erin. Unexpectedly, for someone who didn't know how to use Qi very well, he had quite a large amount.

"Yes… yes, yes."

Looking at Erin, AJ was clutching onto his camera so hard it nearly broke, but it was a good thing he hadn't done it. Out of nowhere, something could be seen in the back of the camera, and it all happened in an instant.

Erin felt a powerful force grab her right by the neck, and the next moment she was slammed into the ground. A large eruption had occurred, shaking the entire planet. Everyone was nearly thrown off their feet and a volcano of red aura had erupted where the two were.

For Erin, that wasn't the extent of it, as she was being dragged through the ground, her back, arms and everything being pushed through so hard that rocks from the ground were breaking off.

A sudden reaction was occurring in Erin, as her eyes started to glow an intense yellow, and she could see who was the one holding onto her throat.

"GET YOUR FILTHY HANDS OFF HIM!" his eyes glowing an intense red, his whole body covered in a red aura, baring his large fangs, Quinn shouted.

*****

# Chapter 1967 The Power Of A Vampire God




A little while ago Fex, Minny and Quinn were on the same ship heading to the location where Chris and Peter had reported finding both Erin and Zero. They weren't far away now and the ship was travelling at full speed.

For some reason, as they got closer, time felt like it was moving slower, and in doing so it was just making Quinn more restless. Because of this, Quinn was already wearing the celestial red fang armour, ready to fight at any second.

"Quinn I know you are worried, but there is nothing that we can do right now." Fex said, trying to calm him down. "Besides, you said it yourself, Peter is incredibly strong and Chris is one of the toughest people you fought."

Quinn continued to tap his foot away.

"Peter already lost to Erin once he said. So I have no doubt in my mind that he will attempt to fight her again. If that happens, then Chris will get involved as well, because that's the type of guy he is."

There was good reason as to why Quinn was extremely worried. For one, Bliss said that Erin's growth was one that would be able to outmatch his own. A person that would become so strong that they could deal with the one that created the vampires. Then there was the celestial Mundus as well.

From their short meeting, Quinn could tell he was a powerful god. One that he wouldn't want to step on the toes of either. The fact that he even requested for Quinn to take out Erin meant that these powerful people thought that she was a problem.

The ship had finally entered the planet's atmosphere, and the planet looked to be going out of control. Lava was spewing from some areas of the planet, while tornadoes were spinning wildly destroying the rocks and ground around it.

The planet seemed to be in pain from whatever was going on.

"Fex, fly it northeast." Quinn ordered. "I can feel an energy, but it's really weak."

Worried and concerned, Quinn's fangs were already baring out, and he was grinding his teeth with worry. Which was why, the second that Quinn could see people in the distance, he didn't hesitate.

"Minny stay with your uncle Fex, he will look after you." Quinn slammed his hand on a button of the ship a little too hard smashing it to pieces, lifting up the glass. Then using the ship as leverage, he pushed off it, causing it to move backward as he flew off into the distance.

While going through the air, and getting closer, Quinn could see it, he could see Erin holding Peter by the head. His whole body was pulsating with his heart beat as it got faster and faster.

Ripples of blood aura could be seen in the air as he travelled. Quinn was unable to contain his anger.

'I won't let you kill anyone else, no matter what!'

Using blood control, with the blood aura pulsating around his body, Quinn was able to superspeed himself right to where Erin was and grabbed her by the neck before she could do anything else.

He then slammed her into the ground, and like a meteorite hitting the ground, the two of them were skidding across the floor causing damage to the ground.

"GET YOUR FILTHY HANDS OFF HIM!" Quinn shouted.

Erin's eyes started to glow with power, as she felt a presence like she had never felt before. Her natural instincts as a dhampir were kicking in. Giving her an immense rush of power.

However with Quinn's rage at a boiling point, it didn't matter, as he lifted her by the neck where the two were and slammed her into the ground, causing cracks to appear in the whole area.

'What is this!' Erin thought. 'All the Qi I gained, and the Dhampir power to go against my natural enemy. I still can't match the strength around my neck. I'm having to use all the Qi to just stop him from crushing my neck.

Quinn was unaware of what he was doing, but when holding Erin by the neck he was attempting to squeeze. Due to the reinforced Qi it was being difficult, but covered in red aura, these two were acting out his killing intent.

A strange red mist that would float around Quinn's gauntlet, was creating small little daggers that were moving trying to also rip out Erin's neck.

Regardless, Erin wasn't on her own as a large claw, went to swipe toward Quinn, but with his other hand free and quickly turning his head he had grabbed it. Quinn was holding onto the Boneclaw's hand, away from his head.

"I was told about you… so you found someone better, but you made the wrong choice."

Using the blood aura that was around Quinn's body, he had shaped it quickly into weapons, and sent them straight towards the Boneclaw who started to teleport away, making the blood swords hit nothing but the ground.

They continued to appear and move to where the Boneclaw was chasing him. As Quinn was distracted, the black cat appeared, summoning a spiral of flames towards his face.

That's when a shadow had appeared, covering the entire flames, extinguishing them and turning them to nothing. The shadows had also soon turned into a hand that had grabbed one of the four kings holding it in place.

The cat struggled, unable to break free from the shadow hand's grasp. This was a new and improved version of the shadow that Quinn had learnt to use. He could strengthen his shadow, giving it a more physical form, by adding his second stage Qi to surround it.

It was something that was incredibly hard to learn, but with his own celestial space where he could slow down time, Quinn was able to learn a number of things and now right above the cat's head was a sword, ready to fall down on it.

As it did, the cat suddenly disappeared into nothing, and Quinn could no longer feel something in his hand. Erin had somehow managed to escape from his grasp, and was quite a distance away on her horse.

As Erin ran away further, she turned around on her horse, summoning the cat and the Boneclaw back to her side.

'What is this, the power inside me is still rising, and it's to a level beyond Laxmus. Is this how powerful the vampire right now in front of me is? Is this how powerful Quinn is?'

After absorbing all the Qi, and now this as well. Erin was growing in strength by the second.

During the small confrontation that was going on, the spaceship had caught up with everyone and had landed just behind AJ and the two vampires. In doing so Fex had jumped out along with Minny and could see Erin in the distance.

'I wish I could be the one to finish you off, but I can tell you have grown too powerful for me. I will just have to rely on my blood brother to do the job, and for that he needs no distractions.'

"Who are you guys?" Vanessa asked.

"No time to explain." Fex said as he summoned his red string from his fingers. He could still use his ability but not so much with his vampire aura, as he now only had mainly celestial aura.

Stil it was enough to tie up both Peter and Chris, and bring them through the air, towards them.

"Catch them!" Fex ordered.

Both Lucas and Vanessa jumped, catching both Peter and Chris, bringing them back down to their side.

"Wait, who are you guys, and who is that fighting right now?" Lucas had to ask, as he checked on how Peter and Chris were doing.

"There's an emergency supply of flesh on board our ship, feed him that. You can trust us, we are here with Quinn." Fex answered.

As Lucas was running to the ship, he had a sudden realisation as to what the old vampire had said.

"Holy Crap! Quinn!"

Back out on the field, the distance between Quinn and Erin were around fifty metres away. Over his right side Quinn had gathered his vampire aura, forming a shape of a wing, and over his left side, he had the shadow in a condensed form, forming another wing.

What the others were looking at right now, didn't look like any vampire or human, it looked like a god that had descended.

"Tell me Erin, if I hadn't arrived, were you planning on killing him?" Quinn asked his head down.

Erin was still basking in the rising power she had.

"Ha ha ha, not just him but I'll kill you and all the vampires!!!"

Shadow started to form around both of Quinn's hands.

"I've decided then."

When the shadow disappeared from Quinn's hands, in its place were two large handguns.

*****

# Chapter 1968 Doing Something Better Than Nothing




When Quinn initially crashed into the planet, it was so strong and forceful that the planet shook, causing AJ to fall onto his knees. He held the camera steady as best he could, but all he was filming was dust and the ground.

"What happened?  Is AJ okay?"

"There was just a large explosion out of nowhere and now he was suddenly filming the floor."

"Come on, can't he hold the camera properly, all he has is one job, it's not like he's the one fighting."

"These guys in the comments, you talk like you're tough but I don't see you out there filming war and fight scenes."

AJ had eventually managed to catch his footing and in doing so he started to film what was happening. He caught red aura being formed into swords piercing the ground, and zoomed in on Erin, who looked to be struggling for her life as she had a hand around her throat.

"Sh*t who is this person? I feel like I'm watching a movie, did someone really come out of nowhere and grab the dhampir like that. Wasn't she talking a load of crap about how powerful she was now that she had all this Qi?"

"I wish this was a movie, but remember what we are watching right now are real lives. I hope the zombie boy is okay."

Due to how fast everything was going, it was hard to get a clear shot of who had arrived. At the same time due to the angle that AJ was at, it was difficult as well, that was until Erin had escaped and the person was now standing there with his two large wings made out of shadow and blood aura.

Panning up from his feet and zooming out, AJ was able to get the whole view of this person, and there was a striking resemblance as he looked at him, and he wasn't the only one that noticed it as well.

"This is the person who is fighting the dhampirs… I guess he's a vampire, have I seen him from somewhere before?"

"In your dreams how would you know somone like him that can face up against the dhampirs."

"No,  I recognise him as well. I guess he must be famous. Especially if he is strong enough to go up against someone like this."

"A famous vampire."

"Hey, I think I might be mad, but isn't that the great Hero Quinn? I have a statue of him, and the armour nearly matches up perfectly; it's just a different colour."

"Quinn, that's it, he really does look like Quinn. The facial features, the armour."

"Wait you might be right, that wing, isn't that the shadow power. He looks like Quinn, as well it has to be him. He probably is the only one strong enough."

Seeing the comments, it had clicked in AJ's head as well.

"I didn't want to say anything before." AJ started to give his live commentary. "But Quinn is back, and has been for awhile. These people that are fighting against these powers, are all here to help Quinn.

"He has been helping out the world once again for a while now. Even helping the vampire corps. There were reports of what he had done. Those rumours weren't just rumours."

Taking a deep breath, AJ was ready to say his next few words.

"THE HERO QUINN HAS RETURNED!"

There were those that wanted to deny it, thought that it couldn't be true, but in the end, the similarities and the show of his power were too much of a resemblance to be a fake. Once again Quinn had returned and he had done so to stop a great calamity,  just like he had in the past.

AJ thought this was fate, his ancestors were the ones that had filmed Quinn fighting the leader of the Dalki back then, and he was now filming Quinn once again.

Inside the celestial space, they had also recognised the figure that had appeared. The one that had fought side by side against the god slayer to defeat Athos.

"BB… BB is here, and is fighting against the god slayer, but I thought he was attacking us. Didn't he come in here not too long ago and cause a rampage."

The celestials were certainly left confused, not understanding the full situation because they didn't care for it.

However, Yongbu's whole body was shaking.

"It's him again… and he looks stronger than before." Yongbu mumbled to himself.

"I see now!" Xox said with excitement. "The reason why Mundus hadn't acted and wasn't so worried is because he struck a deal. He must have gotten BB over to our side to take out the god slayer."

The others nodded their heads in agreement, they had seen how strong BB was, had suffered from his attacks themselves, and thought this was a good choice of celestial. This one would not fail.

——

Back towards the ship where the filming was going on, Chris had been awoken by the surges of energies that were rampant and about everywhere. As he took a peak, seeing Quinn standing there he had a smile on his face.

But soon, Chris remembered something else as well.

"Agent 4!" Chris weakly shouted out.

"No, that's Quinn." Fex repleid. "Did you lose your brains."

"No." Vannesa chimed in. "He's talking about Agent 4. He ran off somewhere in the middle of the fight."

"Agent 4… has the red heart." Chris stated. "We have to stop him… I have to stop him."

Chris still was unable to move, no matter how hard he tried, and he felt even weaker than before which he didn't even know was possible. Having 90 percent of his lifeforce taken away, would be tough on anyone.

"The Red Heart, that was the item that everyone was looking for back then. You mean it fell into the hands of Pure. I remember that the red vampires wanted to turn everyone into vampires using its power, but what does Pure plan to do with it?" Fex thought.

Either way he knew that something needed to be done. Whatever they were planning, it couldn't be good, and for Chris to worry about it in this state.

"Right now, I don't think you could even win a fight with a fly. You're just going to have to stay here and leave it to me." Fex exclaimed. "Minny, it's best if you stay with the others. I know your father told me to protect you, but where I'm going, it could be more dangerous. With your father here, I'm pretty sure you'll be safe."

"Don't worry I am strong, I can come with you. Besides I think sometimes father worries about Minny too much, he needs to focus on the fight." Minny replied.

Fex wanted to argue against her, but there was a chance that the fight between Quinn and Erin could get pretty violent, and knowing who she was. He felt like she wouldn't hesitate using a hostage.

"I'll come with you as well." Lucas answered as he stepped forward. "I saw the direction he was headed in, I can be your guide."

Vanessa wanted to come as well, but she knew someone needed to look after these people, and also protect AJ if something seriously bad happened again.

"Fine, let's hurry. I don't want to miss Quinn killing that b*tch!" Fex answered but his eyes lingered as he noticed what Lucas was holding in his hand. "Wait a second is that what I really think it is."

Lucas happily handed it over to the old vampire. Since he was travelling with the great hero, which he still couldn't wrap his head around, he thought that this person had to be someone of great importance.

Fex looked at the sword, up and down, and ran his hands across it.

"This is without a doubt, Arthur's sword, but what is it doing in a place like this?"

The old man seemed to be a little crazy to Lucas. Constantly mumbling to himself and just doing whatever he wished. Now, he was even saying names that he had never heard of before.

Holding it firmly by the hilt, Fex gave it a couple of swings through the air, the sound was magnificent as it cut through it with ease.

"This is perfect. I will be using this as mine. I know Arthur won't mind and neither will Quinn. With this sword, I should be able to help out quite a bit. Even if my old self is gone I won't be useless."

With the sword, Fex had walked over to a person that was with them and pointed the sword right at her throat.

"You are coming with us, and if I don't like your answers, I will kill you." Fex said to Flora.

# Chapter 1969 A Portal To Another World




There was a little bit of a problem with taking Flora along, for one her legs were still broken from what Peter had done earlier, and at the moment there were no signs of her legs healing anytime soon.

However, Fex had a solution for that, using his strings he was able to connect them to Flora's legs with a needle at the end. All of this was muscle memory for Fex as he was a master at using others as a puppet to fight for him.

Using the strings Fex ran along, Flora, Minny and Lucas were all off as a group and took a wide step around where Quinn and Erin were to do battle.

However, as Lucas ran out in front toward the location where Agent 4 had gone, he couldn't help but turn his head towards Quinn and Erin.

"What is going on, why aren't the two fighting? Both of them have just been standing there for a while." Lucas asked.

Seeing them just stand opposite each other made Lucas stay on top of his toes, as he felt like the shockwaves from these two fighting would sweep them away at any moment. It was why they were taking the long way around the fighting area, rather than cutting through in the first place.

"What you are looking at right now is a high level fight between two incredibly powerful beings." Fex explained, as he continued to run along with the others. "Right now, they are probably waiting for the other to react, so they can react to it. Moves are perhaps being played out in both of their heads.

"The thing is, these two haven't fought before, they don't know each other's strength or skill sets."

As Fex was saying this, Lucas imagined that even Erin didn't know the extent of her strength after absorbing the Qi of the others.

"With these types of things, one of two things tend to happen. The fight ends extremely quickly, or it's drawn out until they use up all their energy, with one managing to trump the other."

Lucas had seen the latter happen twice now, and both times, their side had lost, he was just hoping this time, the side he was rooting for would win.

"Quinn… if this really is the hero of the old. I hope he can pull a miracle out for us all again. Otherwise I fear our existence as vampires will be over before we know it." Lucas said quietly to himself.

"My dad is stronger than anyone, and will beat up anyone. No one has to worry about anything." Minny said smiling.

Seeing Minny keeping up their pace, for a young vampire Lucas thought it was pretty amazing, but he soon smiled to himself. What did he expect from the little girl who called the Hero Quinn, her father.

——

At the location where the others were heading to, things weren't completely calm there, as two creatures were fighting it off against each other.

Several tentacles had latched onto Laxmus, wrapping around each part of his body, and they were overpowering him as it was attempting to drag him into the strange magic circle.

For Agent 4, he had thought about running away, but when he made a few steps, he could see that the strange eyes that were on the tentacles turned toward him. Whatever creature was coming out of the thing, it was now aware of him, and its eyes told Agent 4 to not try to escape otherwise it would attempt to come after him.

Due to his weak current state from the fight, Agent 4 decided to go into hiding instead, taking cover by one of the large rocks that was on the same level as the peak of the mountain.

Several red beams were seen coming out from Laxmus's mouth destroying the tentacles, but the same thing would happen again and again, as the tentacles regrew. Taking a peak around the corner and looking at the magic circle, now Agent 4 could see more of the strange beast's body, or a more correct word would be, the demon's body.

A hand was seen as it pulled itself out of the magic circle. The hand itself looked similar to that of a human's hand, apart from the fact that the fingers were slightly longer and had less fat on them.

This looked more like the hand of a skeleton, but coming out from the fingers itself there were small long parts wiggling off it. It looked similar to the tentacles, only smaller all over its hand, like worms.

The top of its head could be seen, and there were no eyes in sight, at least not that Agent 4 could see. To him it looked more like an opening of a flower, with a strange red part in the centre while the rest of the skin was a strange darker grey.

Finally, it had managed to push itself completely out of the portal, revealing animal-like legs that only had two toes split wide like a dinosaur of old, but once again, the large and small tentacles all around it could be seen.

The large tentacles that were attached to Laxmus, seemed to be coming off from mainly the creatures' back. It was just as big as Laxmus as well, but looked far more horrendous.

"I thought the first one to attack me was menacing, but this is something from children's nightmares." Agent 4 said to himself. "What is happening though. Zero stated that doing this would open a portal for his master to come through.

"Is that his master? It doesn't seem to have enough intelligence to be Zero's master and on top of that. The circle, despite what has come out… It looks like the circle is still open."

Agent 4's guess was correct as he soon could see something else, start to rip through the magic circle as he could see thousands of razor sharp teeth come out.

"This… it feels like it's a portal to another world, a world with demonic creatures… Did Zero's master trick him?" Agent 4 thought.

The strange creature picked up Laxmus, and with the tentacles and started to slam him into the ground breaking the rocks everywhere. Laxmus had opened his mouth again, producing a vampire aura blast out of it. This time, after it ripped through the tentacles, it was going for the strange plant-like head.

When the attack came close, the plant head started to open up, spreading wide. The attack hit and caused the demon to move back an inch or so but that was it. The attack looked like it was being gobbled up, and when the attack eventually stopped, there looked to be no damage on the demon's head at all.

Instead, all ends of its head, the leaf-like parts started to vibrate, and the eyes that were on the tentacles all started to open up. The next second they began to glow red. With the strength of the tentacles, the strange creature had thrown Laxmus off the edge of the mountain.

It jumped to the edge, seeing Laxmus still in the air, falling down the side, and with all its tentacles pointed towards it, it unleashed a red power similar to that which was dealt to itself. The only thing was it had come out from all of the hundreds of tentacles that had been formed.

All points of red energy hit Laxmus, sending him far off into the distance. The attacks continued to hit, they continued to be fired even though Laxmus could no longer be seen, at least no longer be seen by Agent 4.

"I have to say, my odds of survival in this place are slim. If the one I struggled against had just been dealt with like that, then what am I to do?" Agent 4 sighed, almost accepting that it was the end of his life at that moment. "You would hope that the one that summoned him would at least not get killed."

In the distance, on the way to the mountain, Fex and the group could see the beams of energy through the air. They shined brightly and the energy was similar to that of vampire energy.

They picked up the pace as they ran ahead and saw something crashing in the distance.

"It looks like Chris was right." Fex said. "It looks like something really is going on here."

When they finally reached the location of the crash, they could see a barely recognisable Laxmus. Several holes were in its body, its head and all over. There were no signs of life whatsoever from Laxmus.

Although the others had no idea who this was, Flora had recognised the vampire's form, and now looking at the mountain she was starting to fear for her life.
