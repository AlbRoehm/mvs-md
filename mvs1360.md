# Chapter 1360 - The Castle Reward
Arthur laid on the ground, while Quinn stood above him. He was still in his Shadow overload from standing strong, while the Punisher was bleeding from the open wounds, further exhausted by the multiple explosions from his sword.

"Why won't you get up?" Quinn asked Arthur in a growling tone.

"Why don't you just finish me?" Arthur questioned back, continuing to just lay there.

"Because you haven't gone through the same pain as I did back then!" Quinn answered immediately. "Do you think I don't know? I know what your blood armour can do! That damned Richard Eno had it on file, so Logan told me about it."

"Every set of blood armour has a different skill. Eno's allowed him to block any attack head on no matter how strong, the King's can destroy anything it touches and then there's yours, the power of the armour itself acts like blood."

"You can use it to power your weapon whenever you wish but that's not all. It also acts like blood for the user, meaning you can consume it to heal your wounds, but it looks like you haven't done that even once during your fight with Bryce or me."

"You might be unable to use your shadow because of that crystal, but if you used that armour you would have been able to continuously fight me at your full strength no matter how hurt you got! Alternatively, you could have used your blood powers to the max without getting hurt if he wasn't there."

It was true, Arthur's friendly smile after Quinn pointed out those facts, said it all. If Bryce hadn't had the crystal he could have used his shadow, if the other didn't have the Absolute Blood Control he could have used his Blood powers, but that didn't stop him from using the armour's power to heal.

As Quinn and Arthur were in the middle of conversing it looked like Bryce had gotten up again, ready to use his Blood powers on the two of them, but something strange had happened at that moment. He fell to one knee and blood started to pour out of his mouth.

Quinn turned his head, because it had become apparent that for some reason, Arthur had no intention of harming him anymore. Feeling something similar about the tenth leader, the Punisher lifted his head to look up.

"You've used the Absolute Blood Control for too long." Arthur explained with a light chuckle. You were already an old vampire in the first place. If you keep it up, you will die… but I bet you knew that already. Is that really what you want? The kid is already too strong for the both of us."

"Shut up!" Bryce shouted, summoning a singular large Blood blade, throwing it out towards Quinn. At that moment, Quinn lifted his hand creating a Shadow portal. As the sword went into the shadow it appeared through another pointing at the King.

Seeing this, Bryce tried to control the sword but he could feel the strain of his body. Instead of using his Absolute Blood Control, he moved out of the way, just in time before the sword pierced the floor. Moments later it lost its solid state, turning into blood.

"How?!" Bryce shouted as he punched the floor out of anger. "How can you still use the shadow? Why can't I get rid of you?"

It was at that moment, they all could feel the strong energy from the vampire settlement again. In the first place, the battle was happening in the pooling area and they were in the fourteenth castle inner castle area.

It wasn't too far away from where they were, and it was starting to concern Quinn as well.

"I've lost, Quinn." Arthur admitted. "It turns out I bet on the wrong horse. When attacking this place, I was sure that there was no one but them could stop me, that's why I agreed to work with them. I won't stoop so low to use excuses like I wasn't able to fight at my fullest, since in a fight to the death only the outcome matters."

"You want to save them, right? That's why you trained so hard to get this strong. Then it looks like there is something that you need to stop over there."

A strange power could be felt rising, that they all could feel but none of them were familiar with it.

"Bryce!" Arthur called out. "The one, we're feeling… Don't tell me you released the Original King?"

Hearing this, Quinn was surprised, he had learned from Arthur's memory about the Original King, that person was who Arthur had gotten his shadow powers from in the first place. Bryce himself looked to be still in the middle of recovering from using all of his Blood powers. If he pushed himself further there was a good chance that he would go beyond the point of return.

"That damned Tempus must have gone behind my back to wake him up!" Bryce cursed. "He doomed the whole settlement!"

"Here I thought you didn't care about any of them." Arthur teased the other as he got up from the ground. Quinn looked at him, afraid that either the two of them were going to fight again, or he would have to possibly fight himself.

It was the reason why he still hadn't gotten rid of the shadow overload, despite him using it for longer giving him a larger drawback.

"Quinn, I'm sorry about what I did, but at that moment it seemed that to save vampires and humans, there needed to be someone beyond me. I was wrong about that person not existing. After I found out that I wasn't strong enough to beat the Dalki, I gave up hope."

"Before you ask, no, I didn't beat you expecting you to get this strong. I admit that I beat you mostly out of frustration, seeing in you a younger me who wouldn't have given up… yet somehow that has created the current you. For all my sins, I'm proud to have played a part in that and I have a feeling that you can grow even stronger…"

"As your reward for showing me another light, I will help you face whatever is there, and after that…I will continue my business with him. That's what we both want, right old man?" Arthur shouted.

Bryce didn't want to agree with what Arthur was saying, but in the end the King actually did care for the vampires, at the very least his own family. It was just that revenge had been the major reason for his continued existence, yet he knew that with the Original King, things were more dire than even under his misguided rule.

Unlike him, the Original didn't have a need to hold back. The Original King especially might choose to eradicate them all, if he deemed them to be unworthy subjects, because at any point and time, he could create an infinite number of vampires under him, something not even the vampire leaders could do.

Bryce decided to hold off on his revenge. He knew that Arthur was a man of his word. If he promised a fight after this mess, then it would happen, provided both of them would actually survive of course.

"Will it be possible?" Quinn asked. "From what I've heard, he's supposed to be the strongest vampire in existence and it took all the other Originals to merely seal him.

"I'm afraid even with the three of us, we might not be able to take him on." Arthur stated. "But with my help we have a chance."

Quinn was worried about what to do, because the truth was his armour was on cool down. Meaning his armour was useless and he no longer had the speed that he had used to overcome Arthur and Bryce.

He had never expected there to be a fight with one that was even stronger than them.

'Wait… the Quest! If those two leave, won't I complete the Quest and get a reward? The system usually gives me exactly what I need, so could it have something that might help me with the fight?'

"You two…if he is really that strong, then there is something I need to do before that. Both of you leave and just wait for me." Quinn said.

Arthur looked at Quinn and nodded, then looked towards Bryce.

"Try not to get too hurt. I don't want to use it as your excuse for losing to me afterward" Arthur taunted the other before escaping in the shadow. At the same time, Bryce got up from the ground, and ran forward stopping right by Quinn. He looked at him, and said nothing as he went off again.

[Cancel Shadow overload]

[Total MC points are now being calculated]

[ - 1120 Mc points]

'HUH?! Why has it taken so many points? Is it because of Bryce's crystal? This doesn't feel like the normal payback from the system.'

[Total MC 240/1520]

'I was able to use the Shadow overload skill for a long time thanks to all of the MC cells I gained on Blade Island. I still have plenty but I will need all my shadow and the cooldown if I want to fight at my strongest.'

The problem was, the cooldown for the armour set was one hour. The two vampires buying him minutes of time would already be great, but an hour was too much to ask for.

[Congratulations Quest has now been completed]

[You have successfully defended the fourteenth castle]

[You deserve to keep your title]

[The castle wishes to reward you]

*****

# Chapter 1361 - Quest Update
[You will receive your reward in the fourteenth castle]

[Please proceed to the throne room]

'This is different?' Quinn thought.

In the past, he had received rewards from the system itself. The only time Quinn remembered something somewhat similar happening, was when he had entered the tower that Arthur was in. Still, Quinn was happy to take whatever gifts he would receive in order to make himself stronger.

Right now, Quinn wasn't only thinking about this fight that would happen soon but also about the battles that would take place after. After all, the Dalki even at this moment, were still at war with the humans.

'I'll have to head there straight away.' Quinn thought as he ran towards the castle.

While going through the floors, there was something else that Quinn was curious about.

'Vincent, do you have any idea what that Crystal that Bryce had was. It was able to absorb the shadow from Arthur and me. It even created those shadow people. Not even I can do that with my shadow. At least not yet anyway.' Quinn asked.

Hearing this question, Quinn could have sworn he heard Vincent sigh.

'It seems these days that I am less of a genius than I imagined. In the past, I thought I had uncovered a lot about the secrets of this world, but you… Someone who hasn't even tried has discovered things that people will never know about.

'It is the same with this crystal. I have never heard of a crystal that was able to stop powers. It also seemed to only work for the shadow but…' It was then that a thought had hit Vincent.

Going through all the things Quinn had been told about abilities, he remembered that a certain someone had said something that stood out.

'Do you remember when your ancestor spoke to you about the different abilities coming from himself? I mean, Ray was it? Well, he stated that not all of the abilities we know today did come from him, just most, and that included your shadow power.

'If we take this into account, then perhaps your power had come from something similar to the crystal. If that is true, then it would make sense why he could store powers into the crystal in the first place.'

After hearing Vincent's explanation, he had a horrible thought. At the moment, Bryce still had the crystal. Quinn was sure that if he had asked to take the crystal off him, he would have fought to the death with both him and Arthur there and then.

It was his biggest advantage over Arthur in the first place.

'If…it can store shadows and give shadow powers to those dead bodies, doesn't mean that a certain someone could get the powers again. Someone who had the powers once before?' Quinn asked.

Now Vincent himself realised what Quinn's worry was.

'Let's hope it doesn't come to that. Truedream took his power, so he shouldn't be able to learn a new one, but as I said, I am learning new things every day, and if this thing can give powers, we have to expect the worst.'

Quinn had finally entered the throne room. Here he could see the throne made from blood crystals in front of him and the hole in the wall behind it that contained the techniques of the shadow.

[You have successfully reached the throne room]

[You will now receive your first reward]

'First reward?' Quinn's inner self was smiling.

[Full restore x3]

[This reward will allow you to reset the whole system to full recovery every time you use it. It will restore MC points, all skill cooldowns of weapons, as well as abilities and skills. However, it will not heal the user or restore blood. Each use only lasts one time, so be careful.]

'This…is just what I need. If I use a full restore now, the hour cooldown on my armour, and my MC points will go back to normal. I can fight again. I should try and not use all three. This can be a really big trump card in the middle of a fight.

'I would be able to use Nitro acceleration twice in a row, and Shadow overload twice as well!' Quinn was excited, and the best part yet was the rewards weren't over.

[Please head over to the throne]

Doing as the system said, Quinn was ready for another reward. The system was the answer, the answer and help he needed to beat all his enemies. When reaching the throne, nothing happened, even after Quinn touched it.

So he did what one would naturally do if they came across a throne, and sat down on it.

[The power of the blood crystals can be felt through the throne]

[It has chosen you as the castle leader. This power now belongs to you]

[Would you like to absorb the blood crystal and power within the throne?]

The whole throne was made of blood crystals that looked to have been mashed up together. Quinn couldn't imagine how many vampires crystals had been used to create such a throne.

Now he was finding out that just like with his gauntlet that allowed him to consume beast crystals, he could consume the crystal from the throne itself.

'Does this mean I will get more blood control or more blood aura in my body?' Quinn wondered. Regardless he couldn't see it as a bad thing and selected the only option in his mind.

[Yes]

The throne started to light up, and a few seconds later, Quinn could feel the chair channelling energy through him. It was strange. Rather than one's energy being sapped, it was as if someone was force feeding power into him.

At first, he felt a rush of energy better than ever. The feeling was greater than when he had consumed blood for the first time. But soon, he realised that his body seemed full, as if it was hitting its limit.

'Damn it, I didn't think the system would give me a reward that my body couldn't handle. I have to control this somehow.' Quinn thought.

The only thing he could think of was controlling the power as he had done with his Qi. He closed his eyes. At the moment, he had more Qi energy than blood energy, but with all this extra red aura inside him, he needed to make room.

He emptied out the Qi in his body. Using the second stage as much as possible to keep it on the outside, he would be able to move it back in when the process was over.

Then, he allowed the red energy to flow into his centre. However, he also needed to make sure to not fill it. If he did, that's what would change his body into his Bloodsucker form. So he needed to spread the aura all around his body.

After flowing it around him for a while, he could feel his body getting used to the power. The strain wasn't there as much anymore as his body tried its best to adapt. Then he slowly could enter the Qi back in again.

It felt like he was scratching his body, and he could stretch it a bit more bit by bit each time. Eventually, the glow on the throne had come to an end. All of the energy from the blood crystals had entered his body, and Quinn opened his eyes.

He stood up and looked at the palm of his hands.

'Haha, I can't believe it. One moment I'm struggling with the amount of Qi, that's In my body, and the next, I'm now overflowing with the red aura. Will my body ever be in balance?' was Quinn's thought, but he couldn't complain.

Having too much of one or the other didn't make him weaker. It was just if he wanted to combine the two, he would have to make one output weaker, which took a little getting used to.

Checking his system, Quinn wanted to see if his blood control had improved. It still showed the same number, which meant although he had more red aura and power to play with, his blood attacks would be stronger, but he wouldn't be able to control it better or do things similar to what Bryce could do with blood.

The messages from the system didn't stop there, and Quinn had gotten a surprise message from a quest that he hadn't seen in a long time.

[Update of quest]

[Become something beyond a vampire lord]

[Update: Your getting closer]

After levlling up to level 70 Quinn had resvied no such messge. After unlocking the full power of the system, nothing had come up. Finally, after absorbing the blood crystals, Quinn had been given a hint to the quest.

'Does it mean I have to increase my blood power even more? Will that finally complete the quest?' At that moment, Quinn gulped. 'Do I even want to find out what is beyond a vampire lord? What if it's something like the Bloodsucker form, and I can't change back. Right now, I can still live an ordinary life.'

'Quinn!' Vincent called out.

'I don't know if you know this, but you were absorbing that energy for quite a while. You need to hurry and help the others now!' Vincent warned.

*******

# Chapter 1362 - The Strongest Form
Erin had been placed out of the way over to the side with the other vampires, and now both Arthur and Bryce were walking towards Laxmus. Arthur no longer looked exhausted. This was because he had decided to use the effect of the Blood armour to heal himself, consuming blood for the first time in a while.

'I did promise not to consume human blood, but this can be considered a work around, can't it?' Arthur thought.

Seeing this, Erin wanted to charge in as well. She had strong weapons and the skills to back them up, but there was one person who stopped her before she could move, grabbing onto her wrist.

"Don't." Leo shook his head. Looking at him, Erin could see that he wasn't in the best of conditions. The Blind Swordsman had been hurt pretty badly internally and that was just after suffering a single hit of Laxmus' wings.

After spitting out a little more blood, Leo was able to speak clearly.

"That being is something beyond a normal vampire, I fear that even if all three of you went up against it, you wouldn't survive. Even if you did, you need to consider your own situation.

"All vampires, including their leaders, have seen you use that yellow Aura. We can no longer hide what you are. Out of gratitude they might let you go today, but eventually vampires will start coming after you, fearing what you are.

"If you help them fight, I guarantee that you will not be able to get out of there intact or with your strength. Head back to the tenth castle, wait there and I promise…I promise if we survive this thing that I will be there."

Erin looked around the area, and all of the vampire's eyes were on the battle that was about to begin at any moment. Ultimately, she listened to her teacher, and decided to escape to the tenth area while no one else was paying her any attention.

"I'll help block anyone from seeing you." Timmy offered as he had the power of mist, making such a thing an easy task. With that the two of them were gone, while the rest of the settlement weren't safe at all.

"I don't know why these two have suddenly chosen to cooperate, but now's not the time to ask any questions. Their strength is exactly what we need. I have hope." Muka said.

At that moment, the Blood swords floating in the air headed straight towards Laxmus.

While this was taking place, Arthur quickly moved over to Bryce's side using the shadow, and he had the shadow power constantly on his back, ready to use.

"I felt a bit of his power when I blocked that attack just now. Thank you for not using that strange power of yours, but I fear if I take a few more of those attacks, even my shadow won't be enough."

"Take this." Arthur said, grabbing the other's hand before the King could react, placing it on his armour. Bryce could feel that an energy surging through him, similar to when he consumed blood.

"What are you doing?!" Bryce swung his cane sword, yet Arthur was able to block it in time with his own.

The leaders seeing this wanted to slap their hands against their faces, at a time like this the two of them still couldn't get on.

"Arghh!" Laxmus shouted, and out of his body, a red aura expanded. The blood swords that Bryce had created fell in an instant, all hundred of them.

"I think you're going to need a lot stronger of an attack then those swords old man!" Arthur explained, as he himself condensed his shadow into a shield again and charged in.

'That beam of power, it takes a few seconds to charge up, so I will have to face him in close quarter combat instead. Still it looks like it packs quite a punch.' Arthur thought.

Before Arthur could set up an attack, he could see Laxmus, suddenly dash forward and throw a punch of his own. This speed, it reminded him of someone he had recently thought. Just in time, Arthur lifted the shield. He could feel the other's strength through that hit alone, sending him back a few feet with each hit.

Arthur couldn't find the right time to retaliate, but he didn't need to because he wasn't the only one fighting. From behind, Bryce had gotten in a perfect position and his regular sword was now covered in a vortex of blood. He thrust it forward towards Laxmus' back.

Aware of the situation, Laxmus stopped his attack on Arthur, and curled up into a ball by making his wings cover his entire body. A clang was heard as Bryce's Blood sword hit the wings, yet the vortex continued.

It was unleashed and had trapped not only Laxmus but Arthur as well. The only way Arthur could get out was by using Shadow travel to get him out of the area. The vortex of blood went up ten meters high, it was the same as experiencing thousands of Blood slashes at once.

When the vortex started to fade, they could see Laxmus still tied up in his ball-like shape. Arthur, seeing this, charged back in.

'He didn't get hurt by any of that, his wings must be one of the strongest parts of his body!' Arthur realised.

At that moment, Laxmus released his wings and a red aura could be seen slashing from all directions. Arthur blocked it with his Shadow shield and continued moving forward, while Bryce was able to control the blood moving it away from himself.

However, the attacks continued to where the people were, and the leaders had to jump in. At first they used Blood slash of their own, but it did nothing against Laxmus' strike. Knowing this, all they could do was help clear a path.

The swipe that had come off from Laxmus had hit a few stray vampires who were unable to move in time, while also tearing the ground apart.

'Is he really that strong to contend against Arthur and the King?' Sunny thought.

Arthur continually charged in, and blocked an attack with the shield again, another claw, then when the second hand was ready to move, the shield expanded from a round one, into one that was large and square shaped blocking the view of Arthur himself.

He then jumped, somersaulting over Laxmus' arge body, leaving the shadow behind, and swung out the sword with the string as hard as he could, looking for an open spot. He wanted to hit anything but Laxmus' black covered hands and wings, as those seemed to be the hard parts on the body. The winged creature managed to turn around and grab onto the sword.

'That's perfect.' Arthur thought, activating one of the abilities, he caused a large explosion. This time, the explosion was far larger than when Arthur had faced Bryce or Quinn. It had sent him flying backwards as he was hit by the recoil despite him using it with the string ability.

Arthur was quite hurt by the explosion. He had never used it at this level before, but now he was using the armour to heal himself. Still, Arthur could soon see that Laxmus was completely fine. Once again, the wings had wrapped around the front of himself.

'What is the man doing?' Arthur thought, but could see that for some reason, Bryce hadn't moved. The vortex had taken a lot out of him, and to top things off it hadn't injured Laxmus at all due to the strange ball form he had taken.

'I need to somehow get past those wings, or past that armour!' Arthur thought.

As if someone could hear his thoughts, an object could be seen coming from the sky. It was small but as it got closer they could see it more clearly, and finally it had landed in the middle of the field, crashing down and shaking the ground beneath them.

"It's… a Bloodsucker?" Arthur thought, looking at it strangely.

The next second, it moved, and was instantly where Laxmus was, a punch was thrown and it was avoided by the Bloodsucker. A puch that Arthur could barely block. The Bloodsucker jumped on its back, and pulled on the large wings holding it in place.

It looked like Laxmus was struggling to move them, as all the muscles in the Bloodsucker's body were used.

"Now, attack him with everything you got!" The Bloodsucker hurried them.

'A Bloodsucker that can speak? It's so fast and can overpower the strange being?' Arthur was confused about the situation, but still did as he was told.

"That's Quinn!" Muka shouted, recognising the other. The tenth leader had done something similar in the past, only this time he seemed to be far stronger than before.

*****

# Chapter 1363 - Save The Settlement (Part 1)
After reaching the rewards from completing the quest, Quinn had a few options he could do. One of them was to use one of his full restores, allowing him to activate his Nitro accelerate again, rushing towards the battlefield.

However, although it might only be a few seconds, he feared that those few seconds would be vital in a fight. With the new red Aura in his body, Quinn had come up with another idea.

'What if I use the energy to turn myself into a Bloodsucker? I usually fill my body with the red energy anyway to turn. Will it make it so I become even stronger than I usually would? Becoming a Bloodsucker double's my stat points, giving me twice my speed and strength, but I'm unable to use blood skills or the shadow.'

Quickly thinking about it, there was no harm in trying, and Quinn had decided to fill his body with the red Aura changing him into his Bloodsucker form. His body quickly started to change, and it felt different from the times when he would usually change.

'I haven't used this form in a long time, but is this normal?' Quinn wondered.

Once his body had finished changing, Quinn immediately decided to use the strength of his legs to jump. Doing so, he had gone so high up he broke through the castle ceiling and had landed in the inner area.

It had worked, Quinn could feel that he was stronger than before, and perhaps this was more than double his stats. He started to sprint on the ground running as fast as possible, and then leapt at the last second. In doing so, he jumped right over the fourteenth castle walls and landed right where he needed to be.

He could feel the energy from the fight, and it didn't take Quinn long to figure out that the strange-looking vampire creature was the one that needed to be dealt with. Quinn had no idea how strong his strength was in his current form, but he did know that if he was hit, he might very well lose his life.

——

'That's Quinn?' Arthur realised after hearing Muka shout. 'You really did go through a lot. You even learnt to control this dangerous Bloodsucker form. Well, I won't let this opportunity go to waste!'

Arthur dashed forward and, at the same time, threw his sword out directly towards Laxmus. Only unlike all the other times, Arthur did something else as well. When leaving the palm of his hands, he had done so giving it a boost of power with his red Aura.

The sword was covered in red Aura that it was now twice the size of what it usually would be. This didn't just increase its strength but also its speed as well, and one more person was giving it an extra push.

Glancing over his shoulder, he could see that Bryce had his hand held out, using absolute blood control, to push it so the sword would move even faster.

'Looks like you can come through when you're needed.' Arthur smiled.

Everything was happening within a fraction of a second. With Quinn holding back his wings, and despite the extra speed, Laxmus was still ready.

Quinn could feel the strength of his wings trying to shut and defend itself. It took all his strength to hold them back that there was nothing else he could do.

Seeing the sword coming towards him, Laxmus decided to use his two hands to catch it instead. His hands that had the black blood hardening touched the weapon, allowing him to remain uncut. Still, for the first time, the power was something that even Laxmus couldn't stop.

His legs skidded across the floor, and the sword continued to push forward. Even with his great muscles, the sword was moving closer and closer until it pierced through Laxmus chest, but it was only an inch inside.

'Why, even though I've stopped the sword's momentum, it feels like it's still trying to push forward, and it's so powerful.' Laxmus thought.

Looking around, he could see that the king still had his hand held out. The veins on his hand and head showed as Bryce held his breath with a smile on his face.

"You…are not so strong after all!" Bryce said, weakly but still loud enough for Laxmus to hear.

"ARGHHH!" Shouting in a rage, Laxmus started to push back even more, and the sword that was inside was being pushed back. Everyone watching was now praying that somehow these three could defeat Laxmus here and now. Seeing this, they were starting to lose hope.

"We have to be ready," Muka said. "We can't be sure that they can beat him, and if they don't, it is up to us to protect the others."

The leaders nodded in response, ready to jump in at any moment, even if they felt like they had no chance of defeating such a being.

However, Quinn wasn't going to let this happen. Jumping off from Laxmus' back, Quinn then pushed the back of his sword with all his strength. He hit the hilt, pushing it in deeper and deeper. With Bryce helping move the sword, the tip went in even deeper until a clang was heard.

No matter how hard Quinn continued to push the sword, it wouldn't budge any further.

"Quinn, get out of there!" Arthur shouted, seeing this.

Listening to the advice, Quinn quickly moved, and fearing that he might get hurt, he felt like it was time for him to revert from his Bloodsucker form. In doing so, he could use the shadow powers once again and sunk in trying to appear by Arthur's side.

In that brief moment, while the sword was still in Laxmus' chest, Arthur activated the explosion power, creating the largest blast possible, and at the same time, had used the shadow to cover the area around him, so the explosion wouldn't hurt any of the vampires in the nearby area.

A few seconds later, and red beams of energy could be seen hitting the shadow. Arthur could feel this and decided to take his shadow back to where he was currently.

'The attack is too strong to redirect it elsewhere.'

They could then see Laxmus standing there, blood dripping from his chest, but he was still alive and well.

"Do you really think I wouldn't try and protect one of our weaknesses?" Laxmus asked.

What he meant by this was his heart. The strange black hardening blood that Laxmus had wasn't just covering his wings and arms. It was also covering his heart and the inside of his head.

"If you want to kill me, you're going to have to do it properly." Laxmus flew in the air suddenly and threw the sword to the ground. He looked around as if he was looking for someone in particular, and he then found his target.

He started to dive down at an angle heading straight for Bryce. Who had fallen on his knees once again.

"Because of you, you were able to give them that push, and the people still see you as their king, so it's time to change that!"

Jumping in the air, between the two of them, Arthur was there swinging his sword. Still, it was quickly blocked by one of the black arms, and then with his other arm, Laxmus hit Arthur straight in the stomach, sending him back to the ground.

Seeing this, Quinn was thinking about what to do. Arthur couldn't stop him, and if he attempted to do the same, it was possible that the same thing would happen to him.

'I only have one choice.' Quinn thought.

[Full restore activated]

[Cooldown have been reset, and MC points have been restored]

While in the air, Laxmus could see Bryce not moving. He started to gather blood aura in both hands. It looked similar to when he had done so with his mouth, only these balls were smaller. The blood gathered looked darker than what the vampires would typically use.

So no one else could try to interfere, Laxmus then threw one of the balls of red Aura towards Arthur and Quinn. While the other was thrown towards Bryce. As they left Laxmus' hands, they started to expand, getting bigger and bigger.

'I don't know how big that's going to get, and if I block it, it will just be a waste of my MC cells.' Quinn thought. The ball of Aura would soon be upon both of them.

'I could use shadow lock, but the attack will hurt all the others if I do. I need to stop this attack!' Quinn thought.

[Shadow overload skill activated]

******

# Chapter 1364 - Save The Settlement (Part 2)
[Shadow overload skill activated]

Shadow started to surround Quinn's body, giving him the shadow body. Now, with unlimited use of the shadow, Quinn raised it, hoping to block out the attack.

At the same time, the other ball of red Aura was heading towards Bryce. His body was weak. He could still use his blood powers, but moving was straining his body all over. Still, even using absolute blood control would do nothing to move the attack coming from Laxmus.

"It looks like this might be my end," Bryce said. "At least I got to see that damned punisher hurt."

As both of the balls of Aura came towards Bryce, all he could see was red until a figure stood in front of him. She placed her hands on the ground creating a blood wall, using all the power she could, and then stood up, spreading her arms.

"KAZZ! DO NOT WASTE YOUR LIFE HERE, GIRL!" Bryce shouted.

A tear could be seen falling from her face.

"They still need you to defeat him. I am just doing my duty, to protect the king. Goodbye…father." Kazz said, closing her eyes. Ready for her life to disappear.

"He's right, don't be stupid; you should leave this to the old fools like us." A voice said, now standing in front of Kazz.

"Get behind me, and stay still!" Paul shouted. He unleashed all of his red Aura and the poison from his body. Creating almost a second barrier between the two of them. The red Aura hit them, and the power looked to have nearly consumed them whole from the outside.

Those from the outside could just see a giant ball of red Aura. As for where Quinn was, he had summoned the shadow. It was holding out, but Quinn was wondering for how long.

'Is this going to take all my MC cells after this, after this attack?'

Finally, both balls of red Aura started to disappear, and Laxmus had landed back on the ground, laughing where he stood.

"Look at that!" Laxmus said. "Just two attacks and the strongest vampires in the whole settlement have practically come to an end."

Laxmus' laughing had soon stopped, when he could see that a young man stood in front of Arthur. Shadows were covering his body, and Arthur was standing well by his side.

"Well, looks like at least some of you have some strength, and I would expect no less from my own power," Laxmus said, turning to look at how the others had handled his attack. Here he could see that Bryce was hurt, but he wasn't dead.

The skin from his face had partially peeled off, but he was standing just fine.

"You stupid girl!!!" Bryce shouted out in anger, but he could hear the sound of crying.

"Why…why did you save me!" Kazz couldn't stop crying. The sounds of her cry were partly muffled due to the person who had completely covered her with his entire body. It was none other than Paul.

He had hugged Kazz, forcing his body to cover for her in the attack, but that left Paul with his whole body destroyed from the Aura. The Aura was so strong, and with each passing second, his body was breaking off into pieces as if his body had turned into ashes.

"Why…why!" Kazz cried on her knees and tried to hug Paul back, but as she did, her hands went through his body, and the remains of him fell to the ground.

Kazz wasn't free from injuries either, her outer skin was burnt, and everyone imagined it must have hurt, but she couldn't feel the pain on her body. She could only feel the pain in her heart. She didn't realise it, but Paul had become someone dear to her.

Memoires start to flash through her head, of all the lessons he had tried to teach her when she was part of the Cursed faction. He was also always looking out for her back then, and even in the vampire settlement.

"You…were like a…like a…" Kazz couldn't even finish her words. It hurt so much as she grasped at her chest.

Ashley, who was next to Paul before he had decided to run in, had heard his last few words at the side.

"I'm sorry for abandoning you all like this," Paul said. "Please look after them all. I know Quinn will do a good job, but they need you as well and please…when you get back, tell my daughter I love her. Sorry I won't be able to see her face again."

Ashley's tears couldn't stop, and it was the same for his men, who had decided at that moment to all salute their head general. For the time they had served with him and to show respect.

[A family member has died.]

The notification screen had appeared, and seeing the peoples reaction by the side and how he was unable to summon one of his knights, he knew who it was.

'Paul…Paul…'

"Paul!!!" Quinn shouted out.

Seeing how Laxmus' attack had failed to kill the one he was aiming for, he was annoyed. He had decided to try and go for the one that had gotten in his way. In doing so, Laxmus sprinted forward and headed straight towards Kazz, with his hand held out.

Kazz had turned around, and she could see Laxmus' long fingertips almost reach around her neck.

"F*ck you!" Quinn shouted as he threw an overhead strike, with the power of his Qi and Aura mixed in. It had a similar strength to a blood hammer strike, but this was far more powerful than any punch Quinn had produced.

'When did that kid…'

It landed, hitting Laxmus' arm, and to his surprise, the strength was great moving it out of the way. Before he could react again, Quinn had already kicked Laxmus to his side, hitting him away from the two of them, but not far enough.

Before Laxmus knew it, his body had fallen through a shadow, and he was now sent back towards where the king's castle was. To others, it would have looked like a strange move. Quinn was already right next to Laxmus, so why move him away?

However, Arthur knew the reason why. Right now, Quinn was using the skill Nitro accelerate, and to make his hits were hard enough to do damage against Laxmus, he needed to build up his full speed.

With him being so close, the strength and power he would get from the speed had lessened. Laxmus, being confused by where he was, almost saw Quinn next to him in an instant.

"Why, why do you have to kill people just because you have power!" Quinn shouted, throwing both fists forward and hitting Laxmus in the centre of his stomach, sending him through the castle behind him.

The next second Laxmus could be seen coming out and throwing out a punch towards Quinn.

"That hurt!" Laxmus shouted back.

Speed comparison wise, Laxmus wasn't that much slower than Quinn, but there was a person ready to protect him, as a condensed shadow shield had blocked the attack.

Seeing this, Quinn quickly ran in a circle, building up speed, and jumped, spinning his body, throwing out a kick that hit Laxmus straight in the head. It sent him tumbling back into the castle again.

Flapping his wings, Laxmus was able to catch himself before he went further in, and now beyond frustrated, he had opened his mouth. In doing so, the Aura started to gather, creating another ball. It was the exact same attack that he had used against Erin.

The next second, his mouth opened wide, releasing the attack.

"I'll kill you all!"

This time, the attack had spread out wide, rather than in a single destination as if it was aimed to kill everyone in the whole settlement.

Seeing this, Quinn raised the shadow everywhere he could behind him. With it hitting the shadow, the attack was stopped but continually poured out from Laxmus' mouth.

"Can his shadow hold?" Sunny wondered.

"We can't just rely on him. Everyone move into the inner castle area!" Muka ordered.

The red beam from Laxmus lasted far longer than when it did against Erin, but it gave everyone enough time to move out of the way of the far range attack. Apart from a couple who were still on the field.

"Kazz, just leave me!" Bryce stated, but Kazz refused to listen.

A few seconds later, something devastating had occurred.

[Your shadow overload skill has been used up]

[Calculating total MC points 0/0]

'What?'

******

# Chapter 1365 - The Perfect Combination
It looked like Laxmus' red beam attack was coming to an end, but a few seconds just before it faded, Quinn's Shadow overload skill's time had run out. The Vampire Lord knew that there would be a possibility of this happening, but he had seriously hoped that it could have occured at another time.

Since he had fought against Arthur and Bryce the time the Shadow overload skill would last had drastically decreased since his overall MC cells had lessened. He thought the same thing would happen this time, perhaps taking half of his MC points as a drawback, then he would simply use another full restore, but the drawback had taken away all of his MC points.

'What do I do now? I can't block the rest of this attack, I don't have any more shadow!' Quinn thought in a panic. It was strange but while looking at the system it looked like he couldn't use any of his Shadow skills even those that required no MC points.

Quinn did the only thing he could do in this situation and covered himself with the second stage of Qi, praying that it might reduce the intensity of the attack. Meanwhile, Arthur, who was also being covered by Quinn's shadow, started to get hit by the red beam of aura.

The Punisher gritted his teeth and held out his hand towards the tenth family leader, and the next second, Quinn was placed in the Shadow lock, appearing in a dark room, before Arthur joined him.

"Arthur!" Quinn called out as he saw how badly hurt the ancient vampire was. Unlike him, Arthur didn't have the second stage of Qi to protect him.

"I wanted to use this earlier, but I refrained in case I needed to protect the people." Arthur explained with a weak smile. "That attack of his is a nasty one, I don't know how you managed to protect yourself, but I don't even think blood can help me know."

Arthur coughed and a wad of dark black blood came out pouring from his mouth. The blood armour set could be seen activating, but it didn't look like it did anything to the wounds on his skin nor his internal wounds.

"Apparently this attack is more than just a 'mere' Blood aura attack." Arthur tried to joke. "Quinn, it seems that this is where my journey ends, but I believe that there is a way for you to beat Laxmus. Your attacks from before, they were internal strikes, right? I think the reason why he resorted to an attack like that is because he is a lot more hurt than he wants us to realise."

Quinn was wondering why Arthur was speaking in such a way, but soon he saw Arthur spewing out even more blood out.

"If I had known that I would have to save the vampire settlement I would have started healing myself a lot earlier. A big part of me must have wanted to die along with Bryce to end that ancient feud and so that I had an excuse not to complete the Dalki's task." Arthur mumbled. "Anyway, that Shadow body of yours that you used to hold both of us down should be the key to victory."

"Arthur, I-I… I can't use my Shadow powers anymore. That Shadow body has a massive downside and I didn't stop because I wanted to, but because I had to pay the price. I don't think I have a chance of winning without it." Quinn explained dejectedly.

Hearing this, Arthur stood up and placed his hand on Quinn. Since he sensed that there was no ill intention this time, Quinn didn't stop him. However, he remained vigilant, since the time he had lost so miserably against the Punisher had been in this exact room.

"Take my Blood armour, Quinn. Don't refuse me, it's obvious that I won't be able to fight. What use is it to me in such a situation? You are the only one we can rely on in this fight. This particular set will grant you unlimited access to blood and also lessens the strain on the vampire's body due to its effects."

"However, Richard Eno or whatever his real name was, had decided to make a different set of blood armour for the King. He was afraid that such a dangerous combination would give them too much power."

It did seem odd to Quinn. When he heard about its effects and the Absolute Blood Control he thought they were the perfect combination, but the thing was how would it help Quinn. He wasn't the best when it came to Blood powers.

"Just take it, Quinn because after my next request you will understand."

Quinn, used his shadow, to take the blood armour placing it in his dimensional space. He still had the blue fang set on, but could use shadow equip to change when he wished.

"Now… I have one last thing I want to give you. We don't have much time, so let's do this." Suddenly, Arthur's shadow started to appear from his back and moved over to his hands. It then prung from him, and entered Quinn's body. The Punisher's eyes filled up with darker shadow, and so did Quinn's. Both of their bodies were lifted into the air as the shadow was being moved from one person to another.

[The will of the Punisher has started.]

[All powers are being transferred.]

Quinn had felt like he couldn't do anything as the shadow had forcefully entered his body, but then it had eventually stopped.

[Transfer complete]

[50,526/112,345 MC cells]

Although Quinn had read the system message, what he was seeing didn't make sense. Had Arthur really amassed over 100,000 MC cells? No, the even crazier thing was during his fight against Bryce, Quinn and the Original King he had merely used up half of his total.

'Here I thought I was close to catching up to him with a measly 3,000 MC cells. I can see he has used a lot, blocking those attacks. Now I understand why the Shadow overload had run out of MC cells.'

"I have given you my power, now go-" Arthur ended up coughing a few times and the black blood started to stain part of his now armourless upper body. The room they were in also started to crumble breaking away.

It was then that Quinn and Arthur found themselves outside once again. As they looked around them, the scenery had completely changed. All the buildings in the pooling area had completely vanished and only the ground could be seen with small traces of rubble.

Looking in front of him, Quinn looked at Laxmus, who looked to have only just finished his attack, and he had fallen to the ground holding himself up with his arms.

'That attack must have exhausted him greatly, but I'm no fool to attack him in his situation just because he looks weak.'

"You idiot!" Quinn could hear someone shout from the right. When turning around to look at what had happened he could see Bryce on his knees, yet seemingly unhurt.

'That's right, my Shadow overload skill ran out, so other than those that had run into the castles, Bryce was still around.'

That's when Quinn could see that he was holding someone in his arms, the only female that could elicit any emotions in the King, Kazz Cane.

"You colossal fool of a daughter, who gave you permission to die?! How dare you disobey a direct order from your King, from your own FATHER!" Bryce continued to shout at the lifeless body, tears of blood running down his face.

It was a strange sight to see, for not too long ago, Paul had risked his own life to save Kazz, and yet still she had risked hers to save her father's. It was clear that Bryce was weak and he had no way of continuing the fight, but looking at Laxmus he wanted to do everything in his power to end it, getting revenge for his daughter.

"Old man!" Arthur called out. "It looks like both of us are down for the count, but the young one can still fight. Don't let your daughters' sacrifice be in vain. You know what needs to be done!"

Quinn was wondering what Arthur was talking about, why was he trying to taunt Bryce now of all times. More importantly, he thought that the two of them should be getting out of there. Especially since Laxmus looked to be recovering, if not getting a second wind.

Bryce tried to stand up, he did so weakly and at the same time, Kazz's body similar to Paul's started to blow in the wind, turning into nothing but ashes.

"Kid, get over here!" The King shouted at him.

Quinn was confused, what was Bryce trying to do now of all times.

"I said get over here! I'm going to help you kill that bastard, so come over here!" Bryce shouted again and Quinn quickly did as he was told, going to his side. "I will see him dead, and if it's the last thing I do!"

Bryce didn't say anything, just placed his hand on Quinn.

"I…have done many stupid things, but the one thing I was proud of, was her… I…I…always thought about myself, and even now, I am only doing this, for myself."

[A source of energy is being infused into your body.]

[Your Blood control is increasing]

*****

# Chapter 1366 - My Way
Just like a moment ago, Quinn could feel something strange happening to him, but it wasn't just a feeling this time, it was almost as if knowledge was also being implanted into his head. At the same time, his system informed him that his Blood control was going up.

'Did you just say Absolute Blood Control? You mean the power that only Kings are allowed to use. He's passing it on to me?' Quinn questioned.

'Exactly. It's supposed to be in a special book, but the King is the one that is meant to transfer the knowledge and power out from himself and pass it onto the book for his successor. However, Bryce has decided to pass this power onto you.' Vincent explained.

Quinn could feel it, and it wasn't like the raw energy he had gotten from the tower. This was different, what the Vampire Lord was obtaining right now more than anything was knowledge. He was understanding how the power of the vampires worked, how they were able to use the red aura and how they were able to control blood.

'But if he is giving up this power, doesn't that mean he has also given up on revenge? He won't be as strong as he was before and there is no chance for him to fight against Arthur?' Quinn thought.

It was then that Quinn realised something, his conversation that he had with Arthur not too long ago. When he had given him his blood armour set he had talked about it being the perfect combination.

Arthur couldn't' have known that Kazz had died while the two of them were in the shadow space, but it was as if he knew that Bryce would make this choice in the end. The transfer had been complete and Bryce, fell to the floor once more, finally having some sort of rest in this fight.

"Don't disappoint me… Quinn." Bryce .

[Blood control: 10,000]

Before Quinn blood control was near the 200 hundreds but after obtaining the Absolute Blood Control he could control every aspect of it. Shadows quickly covered Quinn's body and replaced the blue armour fang set for Arthur's red Blood armour.

"This is just bloody brilliant!" Laxmus bellowed out in scorn. "You, this generation's King were unable to defeat me, your so-called Punisher couldn't beat me, and I already beat that kid once. Have you gone completely insane to think that someone who hasn't even lived a fraction of my life is going to best me?! You're unable to do anything against me, so you've chosen to insult me?!"

In his palm he had a ball of red aura. It was the same one that he had used before and they all saw it expanding in size.

'I can feel it, I can feel the Blood energy from it? But why didn't Bryce just…' Quinn then held out both of his hands. The aura suddenly stopped, before it started to get smaller.

"What are we witnessing right now?" Muka asked as he couldn't believe his eyes. The leaders understood that Bryce had given the Absolute Blood Control powers to Quinn, but what they couldn't understand was how Quinn was able to do things that Bryce was not, especially in such a short time frame.

The dark red aura had been condensed and was now the same size as a small ball. The same size as it was when it was initially when it was in Laxmus' hands, and it had come to a complete stop now being held in Quinn's hand.

'I can control it, I can feel the energy of all of it, but why can I do this and Bryce didn't?'

Vincent, who was able to witness everything Quinn had done so far, only had one explanation. Quinns blood power must be far greater than Bryce's. The Absolute Blood Control book did give Blood energy to the new King, but it was mainly a technique on how to control it.

However, Quinn had obtained a mass amount of energy from the fourteenth castle, and he also had his own after going through so many different experiences. Holding it in his hand, the Vampire Lord ran forward and threw it out back towards Laxmus, but the Original King was unafraid and instead charged forward as well. The ball started to expand, but with his special hardened black hands he held onto the aura, and threw it up in the air, for it to slowly diperese.

"So what if my Blood powers won't work on you? I will just have to personally beat you to death!" Laxmus shouted.

Quinn's blood armour started to charge up. He got ready to throw out a swipe towards Laxmus. It was larger and more powerful than any of his previous ones and the best part about it was that it hadn't taken any Health due to the armour's effect.

Still, Laxmus seeing this, just knocked the swipe away.

'His power… he is still stronger than my own Blood power.' Quinn noticed.

'Using the Blood power in the same way as Bryce did won't help me. According to his imparted knowledge, every user had their own way to control it. And I feel that for me to use it most efficiently… is like this…' Quinn thought, as he avoided swing from Laxmus' clawed hand, and threw a punch towards his open side.

As his hand was moving, Quinn had gathered blood around it, creating a drill-like shape. The speed of the drill was spinning faster than anything else thanks to Quinn's control. When it hit Laxmus, it continued to spin, piercing the side of his skin.

Blood splattered out in all directions.

'This attack is the same as that Eno bastard!' Laxmus thought, remembering the old days. 'How is this person managing to hurt me! I have received more power than before. I was stronger than when I last thought about them!'

Laxmus had no choice but to move away from Quinn using his wings. Escaping into the air, but as he did he soon found himself losing his enemy's position, only to find him appearing behind him in the air, with another Blood drill.

This time, Laxmus was able to cover himself with his wing, but he was still hit and sent through the air. Quinn then could be seen in the air with a pair of wings on his back, using the shadow to allow him temporary flight.

Annoyed by this Laxmus opened his mouth once more, shooting out a small beam of red energy. Quinn then proceeded to do the same, covering himself with the shadow wings.

[-3,420 MC]

'That red beam was smaller than the other, no wonder Arthur didn't block too many of those attacks even with this many MC points.' Quinn realised.

The attacks that would come from Laxmus's mouth were too fast for Quinn to stop even with the Absolute Blood Control on, and the others quickly picked up on that. He started to fly about in the air constantly using the red beam attacks over and over.

Each time Quinn would use his shadow to block the attack, but he was struggling to get Laxmus.

'Without Shadow overload I can't just make the shadow appear weather I want, and i'm still trying to figure out how to use this blood power I just got.' Quinn thought.

'Quinn, you said it yourself, you're neither Arthur, nor Bryce. Both of them fought differently than you with their powers. Why are you so hung up on trying to fight like them, when you have your own style?'

'Fight in your own way, and use their powers to help you.' Vincent advised.

Thinking about Vincent's words, that's when it hit Quinn. He now knew what he could do that he wasn't able to do before.

'I'll fight him with everything I got!' Quinn hyped himself up as he fell to the ground and protected himself with his wings covering his whole body.

Laxmus seeing this, decided to take more time to power up a bigger charge with his mouth to fire it out at Quinn. The beam was unleashed and it continued to hit the shadow.

[-4,536 MC]

[-2,302 MC]

Notifications kept appearing that Quinn's MC points were going down, but he knew that Laxmus had to have been using energy while doing this, and then the Vampire Lord could finally see that it had stopped.

"That shadow, I know you can't use it for much longer!" Laxmus shouted.

"I wouldn't be so sure about that." Quinn replied.

[Full restore activated]

[112,345/ 112,345 MC cells]

Quinn was refreshed, but that wasn't the end of it.

[Shadow overload activated]

Activating his shadow overload he had complete control of all of his shadow being able to cast them where he wanted, but now having the blood armour with him, there was something else he could use as well.

[Soul weapon activated]

Now standing there, with the Shadow wings covering his back, and his body covered with shadows, Quinn also had the two twin chains running down his arms. They had pierced his forearms causing him to drip with blood.

Quinn had activated both his soul item type soul weapon as well as his enhancement type soul weapon at the same time. Usually Quinn could only use his item type, when he was fighting multiple opponents, but thanks to the red Blood armour having the same effect as consuming blood, Quinn was free to use it for as long as his armour stayed intact.

"I will defeat you my way!"

*****

# Chapter 1367 - Help The Tenth!
Those who had run into their inner castle areas had now crept back out to see how the fight was going. After all, they all knew that the current battle was the deciding factor of whether they lived or not.

If it wasn't for the shadow powers in the first place, they all would have perished by the Laxmus' attack. They wanted to see with their own eyes just what was going to happen to them, what their fate would be. Since they couldn't change their fate themselves and it was in the hands of another, they might as well watch what was going to happen.

Now, they could see Quinn standing there, blood dripping from his arms, while Shadow covered his whole body.

Wrapped around his arms like chains was a type of weapon with razor-sharp edges that also were stuck deep into his forearms. The people could see this, as the shadow body couldn't cover the area where the weapon had joined with his body. The gauntlets that would usually cover his arms had also been removed.

Laxmus, seeing this, thought that he had seen the same thing before. This was no different to what Quinn had used so far, and now he just had a pair of weapons in his hands, so what difference would this make.

He flew up in the air once again, giving him an advantage, but at that moment, Quinn swung his chains back, landing on the ground and then swinging them hard down in front of him. It looked like Quinn was trying to attack an invisible enemy.

Before the Twin tails hit the ground, a shadow portal appeared in front of him. At the same time as the weapons went through the shadows, it appeared behind Laxmus, and slammed onto his back, hitting both his wings. It was such a force that the small blade's had dug and hooked onto his wings, causing Laxmus' whole body to be thrown back down into the ground.

Due to how strong and faster Quinn could move his hands, the energy was also transferred into the Twin tails. It acted somewhat like a whip, giving even more strength to the blow, and for the first time, Laxmus could feel that his wings had been slightly damaged and worse than that, the wound on them wasn't healing.

"Stay on the ground. Flying is annoying!" Quinn shouted.

The next second he started to swing both of the Twin tail's chains rapidly. Out from them, red slashes of blood began to leave. From one swing alone, not just one blood swipe would leave his weapon. Multiple could be seen. Each bend on the weapons had produced multiple slashes of aura, and the attack looked like a wave.

Laxmus was preparing to defend himself from them, using his hands and wings.

'I can still block these. I just have to be careful about the weapons themselves.' Laxmus thought.

However, the attacks soon went into another set of shadow portals, and before Laxmus knew it, he could see several of the shadow portals surrounding him. There were hundreds of them, and the next second, red slashes of aura started to come through them all.

Laxmus needed to be on guard, using his full concentration and power, blocking them all, hitting them away, hit after hit.

"This is annoying!" Laxmus shouted. Opening his mouth and firing a red beam out, hitting some of the shadows above him, destroying them, but as quickly as they were destroyed, Quinn would make more. Slowly, he walked over to Laxmus, contumely moving his arms, swinging the tails out the red blood slashes.

[Shadow equip]

'I can last a few seconds.' Quinn thought to himself.

Changing his armour set from the red blood armour, Quinn had changed to Blue fang set.

[Nitro accelerate activated]

Laxmus was still defending himself from the attacks, that he didn't see what was coming next. After boosting his speed, Quinn dragged the twin tails behind him and threw them as fast as he could, hitting Laxmus' body from the side with them.

He felt great pain as the chains ripped through the side of his ribs. It had pierced his skin, and with Quinn pulling them towards him, each of the small blades grinded against his muscle and even his bone.

However, that was just one of the attacks, of the soon several that were to come. Swinging the chains like a mad man, Quinn continued hitting Laxmus over and over again, and the red aura didn't stop there. They continued to pour through the Shadow.

"Those attacks, they're not hitting him," Bryce commented, seeing this. "Even while fighting him, he's making sure that the red aura doesn't distract him. He has already learnt how to control the blood so quickly…"

In front of his very eyes, Bryce was witnessing someone surpass him. Someone who knew how to use a power he had better than him. He felt like he had been defeated without even fighting.

Seeing that his blood had gone down by fifty percent, Quinn used the blood bank to restore himself and changed armour back to the red blood set. He no longer had the speed, but he had done enough damage to Laxmus, who was now bleeding all over.

Then, Laxmus decided to ignore the attacks, since the wounds weren't great and opened his mouth, firing out another red laser from it. It was too fast of an attack for Quinn to prepare a shadow to redirect it, but he could easily create a shadow to stop it with his body of shadows.

"You know, to hurt you, I don't even have to hit you!" Quinn called out, as he swung both of the twin tails into Laxmus' Shadow. Hitting the centre of his Shadow, and that was when Laxmus noticed the wound appear on his body and a great pain inside him.

"What sorcery is this!" Laxmus screamed.

One of the twin tails wrapped around Laxmus' arm, piercing his skin. He could feel the weapon draining blood from him and wrapping tighter. Quinn then pulled himself forward while swinging another one of the chains above, and when it swung down, it pierced right between Laxmus' neck and shoulder. He pulled on it, ripping through his skin, digging deeper and further, and when he was on top of Laxmus, jumping through the air. Quinn made a fist, forming the blood drill once again.

Laxmus opened his mouth, prepared to fire a beam, but Quinn's whole fist had gone right through Laxmus' mouth before he could fire an attack. The blood drill continued to spin, ripping his mouth to pieces.

Having no choice, Laxmus used all of his strength to break free, pushing back and allowing for both of the twin tail chains to rip through his skin more. Eventually, he fell back, and the bottom half of his jaw could be seen missing from the attack.

"Arghh!" Laxmus screamed, but with the bottom part of his jaw missing, no words he spoke would make sense even if he tried to speak.

'I am a servant of the great Immortui. He has granted me power, the power of a god, and I can't defeat a single vampire! Please, Immortui, if you are watching, grant me more power as your faithful servant so I can get rid of this person!' Laxmus thought.

Surprisingly, his prayers were answered. Laxmus could feel a sudden surge of power growing in him. The black hardened substance started to spread from his arms and now was covering his whole body.

Now, Laxmus allowed the red aura strikes that he had blocked until this point to hit his body, having no effect on it whatsoever. They were useless. Even the wounds that Quinn had created had sealed up. It was as if his insides were made from the hard black substance.

While Laxmus was in the middle of his change, Quinn, using the Twin chains, threw them towards his Shadow, but upon hitting it, he could only hear a clang not harming him at all.

'My attack is too weak.'

Still, it looked like Laxmus was in the middle of a change himself, his body still growing, and two horns could be seen slowly growing from his head.

'I have to create a bigger attack, an attack that can pierce his skin still!'

Taking a few steps back, Quinn felt that there was only one thing he could do. He started to gather his own blood, blood from the field and those who were dead and injured and started to form it in the air above him.

He cancelled the item soul weapon, as he needed to focus. The blood started to gather and continued to spin. As it looked like Quinn was creating a giant lance. The only difference was the blood continued to spin like a drill.

"Quinn is putting all of his power into this attack, but do you think it will be enough?" Sunny worriedly said. She could feel the pressure of the weapon Quinn was creating but was worried about what Laxmus would turn into.

"It might not be," Jin commented," but we can make it enough!" Jin then ran out into the centre of the field. It was a risk, but it was the only thing he thought he could do to help. He grabbed a blade and cut his wrist, drawing blood. Jin then started to make wounds all over his body, and the blood could be seen adding to what Quinn was gathering.

"Everyone, the tenth leader needs your help! Help him gather as much blood as possible! You've seen his skill, how hard he has fought for us. If he can't kill this creature! Then no one else can, so help him now!" Jin pleaded.

Through Jin's actions, everyone knew what he was saying. Using their hands, their sharp nails and claws, all the vampires started to inflict wounds on themselves, drawing blood, all adding to Quinn's power.

As Laxmus' body was seen changing, Quinn's drill was seen growing and soon the size stopped.

'It can't just be big. I have to condense it. So it's stronger, and I need it to be faster!' Quinn thought.

In Quinn's own body, the red aura was being used as a source to compress the power. It felt like at any second it could explode, destroying the whole settlement.

He needed to contain it no matter what, and sweat was dripping down his face as he used all the power he had.

'Now…I need to use the blood control to make it spin faster…faster…faster!'

The speed of the blood in the drill could be seen moving faster, so fast that everyone could hear a high pitched ringing.

"Quinn, kill that thing!" Silver shouted out.

"Kill him! Kill that bastard!"

"Tenth leader, please save us! take my blood!"

The whole settlement soon started to shout Quinn's name, supporting him not only with their words but with their blood as well.

"I hear you…I hear you all!!!" Quinn shouted, as all the blood had been gathered, and Quinn now was ready. Moving his hands down, the giant blood drill fell down. Quinn had formed a type of handle, but using all of his concentration of his blood control, he was using it to keep the shape of the weapon and spin the blood, including the handle. Grabbing onto it, the speed of it spinning was ripping into his own skin and flesh.

The red armour was activated, healing him at the same time, but it wasn't quick enough to heal his skin in time. The drill could be felt tearing the muscles in his bare hand.

"This pain is nothing!" Quinn shouted, holding on tight to the weapon.

******

# Chapter 1368 - The Rain Falls
The Blood drill was spinning faster than Quinn's hand could heal. He didn't know how long he could hold the drill for before he would lose his hand all together, and he noticed that there was another problem he hadn't accounted for.

For the first time, since using the Absolute Blood Control, and controlling so much blood he could feel the strain on his body. The veins all over his body felt like they were about to explode. It was even worse than when he had absorbed the blood aura from the Punisher's throne.

'Is this what Arthur meant by the backlash of that ability? No wonder Bryce is no longer able to move. If my body hadn't gone through that strengthening or I lacked Arthur's Blood armour, I might have lost control far earlier.' Quinn thought.

Still, holding his breath, and ignoring all the pain signs, the tenth leader ran forward as fast as he could. Keeping his concentration, the Blood drill increased in speed even more, just in time to punish Laxmus who had finished his transformation.

He looked at the Blood drill with his now completely red eyes, even his sclera had turned to a crimson tone. However, it was too late for Laxmus to fully react, as the large drill connected him.

Laxmus was now around 3 meters in height, making him practically a giant compared to normal humans, yet the Blood drill itself nearly matched him in size. Stretching out his black hands, Laxmus went to grab the drill. He was confident that his black hardening would save him, like it had done every single other time.

Unfortunately for Laxmus, his immense trust started to diminish. Just like Quinn, the spinning of the Blood drill was similar to thousands upon thousands of Blood swipes hitting his hands simultaneously in the span of a second. The black substance could be seen shedding off, then his flesh, and now his muscles were being ripped by the second.

"That's not possible, I have the power of-"

"Oh will you just shut up and die!" Quinn interrupted him, he was sure that holding it any longer would permanently damage his hands. He couldn't take it any more and pushed it forward, before letting go and falling to his knees. The Vampire Lord gasped for air deeply, only hearing the sound of destruction.

When Quinn looked up, he could no longer see Laxmus, but at the same time, the castle behind it, the King's castle, now had a large hole through it that was bigger than the remaining building. Its top started to crumble bit by bit, then the whole place started to fall down.

Fortunately, there were no vampires close to the castle, but the King's castle was no more.

'Is it over? Is he finally dead? Quinn hoped. There was still more he could do after all. Although he wasn't sure he could handle using the Absolute Blood Control anymore, the Vampire Lord still had the Shadow overload at his disposal. It was active even now and if necessary he could use another full restore to use his Blue Fang set.

"Quinn!" Jin called out, as a type of warning turning around, he could then see a smaller version of Laxmus. He was back to his Original Vampire form of when he had first awakened.

He no longer had any black parts of his body, but at the same time his entire body was free from injuries.

'How…how was he able to survive that?' Quinn asked.

'I'm not sure, but there had to have been some price for him to pay. He has to be on his last legs.' Vincent said. 'Looks like all of his energy or borrowed power has disappeared, so now's the best time to get rid of him completely!'

At the moment, though, Laxmus was standing by Bryce's side, holding the Vampire King by his neck. His body looked limp, and that's when Quinn could see that there was a giant hole in his chest.

"Your King has fallen, but it doesn't look like he was the most troublesome one after all." Laxmus stated. "I will remember this day. Curse your own fates for daring to betray the Great God Immortui!"

There was a reason why Laxmus had gone over to Bryce's side, and it was because he had seen something very interesting on Bryce's body. In his hand he now held the crystal that was filled with a Shadow power.

With it in his hand, it soon left the crystal and started to enter Laxmus' body.

"I knew this would always come back to me someway!"

Quinn got up from the ground and ran, as fast as he could, but the second he took a step, Laxmus had turned into nothing but shadows, disappearing from the place.

The tenth leader looked around, waiting for him to attack. The other leaders also stayed vigilant, afraid that they might end up as his next target. Alas, no matter how much they concentrated on their senses, none of them could sense his presence at all.

'He escaped… After all that!' Quinn fell to his knees. He couldn't believe it. After all the lives that had been lost, after all the power he had gained, the Original King must have been closer to death than even in his fight against the other Originals… and yet, he still had managed to escape.

'Damn that crystal! Why did Bryce bring it with him?! Where did he even get it from in the first place?!' Quinn let out a blood-chilling scream. A few seconds later, as if responding to his cries, rain started to fall on the settlement.

Quinn was left there on his own, with the destroyed King's castle in the background, while the rain continued to pour on him, soaking his hair.

'It is unfortunate, Quinn, but you did all you could.' Vincent tried to offer him some solace. 'The Original King was strong, and perhaps one day he will create an army of his own. returning to face you, but I believe that he realised something in that fight. We all saw that you had completely overpowered him.'

'If he was to return now he would be foolish, for he would just suffer another loss. Everytime he comes back now, you will be able to stop him no matter what army he brings.'

Quinn felt that Vincent's words weren't empty. Through this fight alone, the Vampire Lord had obtained more power than he could have ever imagined. The Shadow overload skill had come to an end, and the draw back had brought him down by 10,000 MC points.

[60,234/102,345]

What would once have made him spit out blood out of shock, now seemed like a small price to pay. Quinn still had over a hundred thousand MC points, his blood control was still at ten thousand as well, and the blood aura he had gained could still be felt flowing through his body.

'But at what cost…Paul, Kazz…even Bryce ended up dying.'

It was then that Quinn finally stood up to check if another man had managed to survive. He remembered that he had been losing a lot of blood, but he laid there on the ground. Alas, there was not a single heartbeat to be heard, only a silent smile plastered on the deceased's face.

"You…taught me a lot." Quinn said as he closed the Punisher's open eyes.

'You know Vincent, when I was a young boy my parents went off to war. They fought for five years before I learned of their death. I never had a father figure, and I guess I was imprinting it on the people around me, yet now even Arthur is gone…'

'But I am still here, Quinn. As long as you have the system I will be with you.'

At that moment, all of the vampires started to come out from the castles. They all were wondering if the fight was over. All of them had watched Laxmus disappear, afraid that he would reappear but he seemed to be gone. They all had witnessed that a particular vampire had achieved an overwhelming victory, thereby saving them all.

The leaders stood out in front, stopping short of Bryce's and Arthur's body. Their knights came to stand behind them, until every single member of each of the families stood behind them on the open field, followed by the unaffiliated vampires.

"Despite all his shortcomings, we thank King Bryce, Arthur the Original Punisher as well as Quinn Talen, leader of the Cursed family for saving the lives of all of us in the vampire settlement!" Muka stated, speaking as a representative for all the vampires, before he went down on his knees, bowing down. The next moment, everyone else did the same, getting on their knees and they spoke in unison.

"We thank you for saving our lives."

Quinn turned around, and could see everyone bowing down to him. Getting soaked by the rain. It was an amazing sight to behold. Thousands of vampires all bowed down to him, an outsider, a human who had been turned.

"Quinn!" Muka spoke as he lifted up his head. "You have saved us from this great threat! This is a challenging time for all of us vampires, but now more than anything we need a true leader. Which is why, right here, right now I hereby nominate you to become our next King!"

This suggestion earned the unanonymous support from all the leaders and no one voiced their objection, not a single vampire from any of the families or leaders.

"Wha…What, you want me to become…the Vampire King?"

# Chapter 1369 - The Future Of The Settlement
'How long?' was the one question on two people's minds. How long had they been stuck inside this dark place for?

When Linda and Fex had first met with Arthur, they had been ready to fight for their lives, but surprisingly the Punisher had not attacked them, rather choosing to listen to them.

"It looks like I was wrong about Quinn, maybe I should give him a chance." Arthur had said about listening to Fex. Unfortunately, before Fex or Linda got a chance to say anything else or ask him what he meant by that, the two of them found themselves trapped in a dark room.

It took them a bit to notice that for whatever reason Agent 11 had not been trapped with him. However, since the Punisher had chosen not to kill the two of them Fex wasn't overly worried for the Pure Agent.

An unknown amount of time passed with neither of them knowing what was going on. The two of them had quickly exhausted whatever conversation they could hold, opting to spend their time to do whatever they wanted… until they suddenly found themselves chucked out of that place and back in the lab, with the Dragon demon tier beast perfectly intact.

"How many days were we in there for?" Fex asked, yet there was nobody there to answer him. The two of them quickly turned around, trying to grasp their surroundings, half expecting that they were needed for some type of fight but there was no such thing.

"I don't think Arthur is here, but why were we hauled out here? Shouldn't we have been brought with Arthur… Do you think something happened?" Linda asked, but despite being a native, Fex had no idea about what the Original Punisher might have been thinking.

Suddenly, Linda felt something going on with Quinn, so she quickly shared that information with Fex. Unaware about the Dalki attacks, they both surmised that Quinn must have come to the Vampire World after they had arrived. The two of them decided since the Dragon was fine that they should head off towards the vampire settlement to assist in any way they could.

As they got closer they could feel huge surges of energy fighting, but they also noticed something else as they travelled through the forest. Fex had spotted a strange device that had already been destroyed, and he soon figured out what it was.

"That look like one of those Dalki jammers! They probably had these so Quinn or the others couldn't get here from the teleporters. Damn it!" Fex clenched his fist in anger. "We've been sent here to help, but instead we've been sitting around doing nothing while everyone else was fighting!"

The duo started to speed up until they eventually arrived at the settlement, though by that point the sound of fighting had stopped. Strangely when they entered the pooling area, they could see that all the vampires were on their knees bowing down to a certain person in front of them.

They could see it was Quinn, so ignoring the bizarre scene they pushed through, but none of the vampires paid them any attention and continued to stay in the respectful bowing position, waiting for Quinn to answer their question.

Not quite reading what was going on, Fex and Linda had come out from among regular vampires and were now in the row where all the Vampire knights stood.

"Quinn!" Fex shouted. "Are you alright, brother?"

Ever since Muka had declared that he wanted to make him the next King, Quinn had his head held down looking on the ground, but hearing Fex' voice he looked up.

"The two of you…you're oka…y…" Quinn's body started to waver, and suddenly his vision blurred as he collapsed, falling on the ground.

Seeing this, the leaders in front of him immediately got up and were about to run forward but there was someone else that had reached him before the others, and it was none other than Leo. The Vampire knight held Quinn by his back, making sure everything was fine, yet it seemed like it was only his body that was exhausted. He didn't know what Quinn had been through but even now the energy in his entire body was moving around like mad, unsettled.

"Please, let us take Quinn, we can look over him." Muka offered.

However, Leo just shook his head.

"He hasn't accepted your request, so he remains the tenth family's leader. I will take him back to the castle. I would suggest that each family worries about themselves."

"When he wakes up, it will be up to him whether he wishes to meet with any of you. That boy never asked to be involved in this whole mess. Nevertheless, he was dragged into it, managing to save your previous settlement not once but twice now. He has earned the right to do as he wishes."

Hearing these words, Ashley, who was now taking charge over the turned humans, immediately created two rows. Leo walked away with Quinn's exhausted body, the vampire soldiers, as they were known within the tenth family, escorted them making a clear path.

Seeing the miserable state of their saviour, the kneeling vampires couldn't help but be thankful. They clapped as the soldiers walked past with their saviour.

"What the…what the hell is going on?" Fex was confused, following Leo and the others, scratching the top of his head. Then in the crowd, he discovered a certain someone who was trying his best to bow as low as he could to avoid the vampire's gaze.

Alas, his luck seemed to have run out, and Fex was happy to question him about what they had missed.

"Hey, Mr 11, get over here!" Fex smiled.

——

As Leo had said, the vampires had decided to head back to their own inner castle areas, to tend to their own families. This included those that were in the pooling area. As for those that served in the King's castle, there were no survivors. The leaders had no choice but to kill the Royal Guards as they were under the influence of the Original King.

Muka had taken Bryce's and Arthur's body into custody, locking them underneath his own castle, where no one should have access. The area where the King's castle used to stand had been marked as a forbidden zone for the time being.

There were also strict measures placed on each of the tombs, in the castles. After finding out that the second leader was the one responsible for waking up the Original King, they didn't want any more Originals suddenly springing up on them.

Those that had lacked leaders currently, the Vampire knights from the families helped them select new leaders and representatives making sure everything was done according to order and tradition.

The strange thing was that even after two days had passed, Quinn had yet to wake up.

Leo wasn't worried, he could tell that the energy in his body was settling just slowly, but it was almost as if his body had yet to adapt to all his new found powers that it still hadn't finished settling.

As for Erin, she had stayed inside the castle. Leo had made it clear that the tenth castle was acting independently to the other families. They were doing as they wished until Quinn woke up, so Erin was safe in the territory of the Cursed family.

The people were free to stay with them, or leave to join other families, but not a single person who had been staying at the tenth family castle had left. Each day the day on everyone's mind was whether the tenth leader was recovering.

In the end, this left the other surviving leaders, and the families that had selected a representative to represent them, to have a meeting of their. Surprisingly, all of the vampire leaders, new and old, had agreed to meet in the pooling area, following Muka's suggestion.

They stood there, looking at the empty space, and the large craters caused by battle. Standing in the circle, there was no longer any council room, or anything like that.

"What is your plan, Muka, you seem to have gathered leaders on your side before all of this had happened, surely you thought of something?" Jake Muscat asked.

"I believe I already made my plan quite clear, I wish to make the tenth leader our next King. This was my wish even before the Original King has been awoken, yet now even more so. As an Original he will likely create an army and come back to exact vengeance."

"At the moment there is no one that can beat him, other than Quinn. If our King is not powerful then this whole settlement will fall, more so than it has done already."

Everyone was quiet for a moment as they took in what he had said.

"I believe Jake is asking the right questions though. You have heard his Vampire knight, it didn't sound like Quinn would wish to be our King. What you're saying is basically that without him we are doomed. …should the vampire families just live separate lives after everything we have been through?" Sunny asked. "What about the Absolute Blood power?"

"Even if Quinn refuses the position, at the moment he has possession of the Absolute Blood Control skill. We might have the King's blood armour, but that was useless against someone like Laxmus."

"Then we will just have to take the Blood power away from him if he refuses to become King." The young Nicu stated, who had become the representative for the first family. It was a surprise to the other families as well, but if he was selected through whatever means then it was fine.

"Oh." Jin raised an eyebrow. "Did I hear you correctly? Are you saying that if the tenth leader refuses to follow our traditions or refuses to become our King then you are going to force him to return the Blood powers to us? Sure, go right ahead, I would love to see what happens if you storm the tenth castle, just know that me and my family will take no part in that."

"The tenth leader is possibly the strongest vampire in existence and even if we were all to go up against him, none of us would survive."

Despite much discussion, the vampire leaders were unable to come to a unanimous decision on anything nor come to any type of agreement. In the end, they felt like the only choice was to wait for Quinn to wake up and give him his answer.

******

# Chapter 1370 - Too Strong
The settlement was in recovery mode, but one family in particular had less to do compared to the other family and that was the tenth family. Their inner castle area had suffered minimal damage, yet they were nevertheless busy preparing a number of things.

Ashley and his men were organising a ceremony, a funeral for Paul, and wanted to ask Quinn a number of things. With Paul gone, they didn't know what their duty was. They had stayed behind under the orders of the Vampire King, but with Bryce gone and Quinn the potential successor to that position, he might allow them to return to the Human World. However, in that case what were they supposed to do about blood and so on. It was a confusing time for them all.

Timmy and Xander had organised the manpower to rebuild the houses and structures in the settlement, but had so far avoided restoring the pooling area. The main reason for that was that they were unsure if they would even be staying in this place. They didn't want to waste their time doing work. And then there were issues with the Cursed faction ship itself.

Without Paul, Leo was more busy than ever in the Vampire settlement, and didn't have a clear picture of what had been going on at the Cursed ship, Linda was in charge of that, however… the reports she was getting didn't sound great.

Apparently, all three major factions were struggling in the fight against the Dalki, this included those of the Cursed faction. All of this information was being passed on to Paul's Office, which had temporarily become Linda's for the time being.

"Do you need us to return to the Cursed ship? We could help in the war." Linda suggested.

"I appreciate the offer, but I don't think that will help much. One person can't really make a difference in this war. This has turned into a full scale battle." Sam explained with a sigh. "We've spread our forces to the three major Cursed planets and are holding them off as best we can, unfortunately I believe it's only a matter of time until they break through.Their numbers show no sign of slowing down no matter how many we defeat. Perhaps they are already using the demon tier beast to their advantage."

"We also need some of you to stay in the Vampire World. Just because we have stopped Arthur from killing the Demon tier beast doesn't mean we have stopped the Dalki's plan of getting full possession of the Dragon. We need to make sure that it is safe more than anything. When Quinn wakes up…"

Sam paused there because he started to think about his statement. If there was one person that could make a difference it was Quinn, but it seemed like the Vampire settlement needed him as well. Were they really useless without him?

"I would like to be the one to inform Quinn. If you just start telling him things, he'll certainly make a rash decision as always. He did good… he deserves some rest. We should at least be able to grant him that."

The call had ended there and Linda let out a big sigh, she felt more useless than usual, especially since she had missed everything that had happened, and now she felt like she could do nothing either.

'More and more people have died in this war…It feels like…it's never going to end.' Linda thought.

——

There was something strange going on in the tenth family castle that the vampires who lived there were aware of, and that was that the top two floors of the castle were off limits. Only those that Leo had given permission to were allowed to be there.

The others didn't think too much of this, because this was also where Quinn was currently resting in his chambers, but there was another reason for this. One of the large bedrooms that was so grand had been emptied and at the moment, Erin stayed there most of her time. The reason why all the objects in the room were to be removed was because she was currently using it as a training room, and there were slashes, cuts in the walls all over.

If any items had been left in the room then they would have been destroyed by now. She swung her Katana blade before swiftly switching to the Demon tier weapon on her back, swinging it above her head, letting out an almighty scream as she hit the ground. The Dhampir was breathing heavily and covered in sweat, even now that she wasn't swinging the blade one could see that her hands were tensed up.

"You're losing control of your breathing now as well." Leo commented. "If this carries on, all this extra training you are doing will make you worse not better."

Erin didn't seem to react to Leo's words as she usually would have and instead put the weapon away and sat down mediating.

"Does it help to swing your sword?" Leo asked, knowing that what she was doing wasn't any form of training at all. The young woman would be doing this nonstop for hours on end, and Leo was wondering if she had even gotten any sleep.

"Swinging the sword distracts me." Erin finally replied. "I don't know why…I can't control it anymore. I thought we had it under control, but ever since we met Laxmus, I can't control it, Leo." Her voice cracked slightly saying those words.

Erin always had a strong appearance, and even before everything the two of them had gone through he had watched her power through her condition without ever complaining, but this time she almost seemed scared.

"I can feel it…she's right." Erin said, opening her eyes that were now glowing yellow. "Even now Leo, with you standing here, I have sliced you down in my head five times already…make that six. Teacher…what are we going to do, what am I going to do…"

For the first time, Leo didn't seem to have an answer. He had done what they could to cure her urges, yet he had never expected her to have this type of reaction.

"There are…knowledgeable people in the Cursed faction. Perhaps, they can find a way to reverse the effects on you, Erin, don't give up. In the meantime, you don't have to worry. Even if you were to try and strike me, I am capable of taking you on." Leo replied.

"Really?" Erin asked.

At that moment, she stood up from where she was, and placed her hand on the hilt of her Katana blade. She waited, and Leo, seeing what she was trying to do, had done the same. It was a quick slash.

The fastest and most powerful strike that Leo had. Using his ability, he could feel that Erin wasn't holding back, so he chose not to either. There was silence between the two, and the second she went to pull her blade out of her sheathe, Leo did the same.

However, Erin's was slightly faster, her blade releasing a strong yellow blood swipe. Leo had done the same, also reinforcing his strike with the third stage of Qi. The two slashes met in the middle, and as they touched, the yellow slash consumed the red in an instant and continued going forward.

Leo, seeing the slash still coming towards him, had no choice but to move to the side, allowing for the attack to continue going forward, and eventually hit the wall, causing a big marking on it to be made.

Leo's hands were shaking as he saw this.

"Erin, your power has gotten even stronger."

She nodded in response, and now had tears flowing down her face.

"I could feel it, meeting Arthur, and then Laxmus, my power keeps growing as if it desires to defeat them. Even without training, I'm sorry Leo, but I don't think I can travel with you…or any of the Cursed faction anymore."

Leo wanted to stop her, but he could feel that even now the energy inside Erin was growing, and the next second, she had gone out of the door, Leo had entered. It was clear she was deciding to head back to the Cursed ship, and away from any vampires.

'It looks like…I failed you.' Leo thought. 'Maybe I was never cut out to be a teacher. I understand how hard it can be now, master.'

Erin's disappearance was kept a secret from the others. A lot hadn't even known that she was there in the first place, and no one had dared to ask questions about her in the tenth family due to her close connection with their currently only Vampire knight, who had temporarily taken over as the leader.

Finally, after more than a week since his fight, the one they had all been waiting for woke up.

Quinn's eyes opened wide, and he could see himself in a bedroom.

"You're finally awake, bro. Or should I call you, your majesty." Fex greeted him. "Man, you sure did a lot, huh. I can't believe it, it looks like I might really have to take some love advice from you."

Quinn smiled, he was happy to see Fex was okay. The Vampire Lord had been afraid that something might have happened to him and Linda due to Arthur's death. However seeing him also acted as a trigger to recall all of the events that had happened before he had collapsed.

'The Quest…the option it's still there.' Quinn thought, looking at his system.

******

# Chapter 1371 - Becoming A King
The first thing Quinn did was check his system screen while he laid there in bed. Everything that happened, it was hard to believe he had gone through it all, but checking the system confirmed it.

He still had all of the MC cells which had been given to him by Arthur, he still had a high level of Blood control due to Bryce passing him the Absolute Blood Control skill and lastly, Quinn could see that he still had an update to a particular Quest, waiting for him to confirm whether he wants to become the next King or not.

Fex had been coming to Quinn's side frequently, after learning from Agent 11 about what happened, the vampire felt like he was even more indebted to his 'blood brother'. He had saved the whole settlement from a great power, which included his own family members.

Having done nothing to help, Fex wanted to at least be there when he woke up, so he stayed by his side ever since. Today the other finally opened his eyes, allowing the vampire to update Quinn on the situation in the Vampire settlement, about how they hadn't yet decided on a new King, the consensus seemingly being to wait for the tenth leader to tell them whether he accepts or not.

'I guess that's why the system still has the option of me accepting the role.' Quinn thought.

"So there is no one in charge of the settlement? And the tenth family have just been able to do as they like?" Quinn asked.

"I mean if you put it like that, it almost sounds bad. However, think about it, Quinn, no one can really stop you now. You are stronger than any Punisher, or King that they could select instead of you. I know it's your decision, but I wanted to say something about that."

"You might not have been born a vampire, but you have done so much for the Vampire settlement, I trust your judgment and understand if you decide not to become King, but just because you reject that role, it will be hard to distance yourself away from all the vampires."

"All the vampires recognise you as their saviour, especially those from the pooling area and if there is a problem they will come to seek you out. On top of that, if there is no one to control them that can be bad in its own way as well."

"Maybe the vampires that believe that we should be in control of the humans will do as they wish, and there will need to be someone to stop them then as well, and then there's the Original King."

Of course Quinn knew this, but the truth was he had been thinking of his human life more so than his vampire life. He hardly had spent any time here, with these people. It was good to get the perspective of a vampire that was originally from the settlement, and Fex of course cared about them a lot.

"I haven't made my decision yet, Fex. I just need more time to think. There are still things the Cursed faction needs to do after all." Quinn replied.

When Fex left Quinn be, the Vampire Lord asked the other not to inform everyone that he was awake just yet. He wanted some time to himself to think about a few things. The tenth leader walked up to his window, and stared out of it. Here he could see everyone in the settlement working hard with each other.

Seeing them reminded him of the scene where all of them had bowed down to him out of respect. He would be lying if he claimed that he hadn't enjoyed that feeling, yet that alone wasn't enough to convince him to add to his responsibilities. Quinn then moved his hand a few times, as if he was getting used to his body, and that was because he was.

'My body feels lighter, and stronger, even more so than when I fought against Laxmus.' Quinn realised.

'That's because your body is still getting used to all that power, but I do have to warn you, Quinn. You've heard Arthur and you've experienced it, that Absolute Blood Control puts a lot of strain on your body. You have one of the strongest bodies a vampire has ever had."

'The reason for your exhaustion I believe was due to your last attack. All the vampires in the settlement gave you their blood, strengthening it. As powerful as that made you, I'm afraid if you do something like that again, then it could be a serious problem for yourself. Who knows how long you will need to rest the next time… '

He didn't need Vincent to tell him twice, because he had felt it at the time.

'Thanks for the advice, Vincent.' Quinn replied. 'I was thinking about what Fex said, about accepting the role of being King of this place. It just doesn't feel right to me. Not just because I'm an outsider, but I don't even feel like the leader of the Cursed faction. I don't know what I would do with it, if not for Sam.

'How am I supposed to lead all the vampires? I mean I barely spent any time in the Vampire World despite having become the leader of a family. Paul had taken care of all those matters for me, but I doubt they'll just listen to me and now he's gone… just like Kazz, Bryce and Arthur. I still find it hard to believe that all of them are gone now…'

Vincent didn't reply, because he believed that nobody but Quinn could really understand what he was going through. The old vampire couldn't imagine how in such a short amount of time, the 'kid' had managed to experience more in a couple of years than what one person would have been through in a hundred lifetimes.

No wonder it felt strange to him.

——

In the end, after a lot of thinking, Quinn decided to leave the castle, making everyone aware of the fact that he had woken up. This information spread like wildfire to the other families, and they all wished to meet him as soon as possible. It was clear what they wanted to talk about which was why Quinn had put it on hold for now, though he had a valid excuse.

The Vampire Lord stated that he was busy with organising a ceremony. One for all the vampires that had passed away, including the deceased King, Paul and the others who had fought in this war. The others agreed that this was important, and had decided to hold a ceremony in the pooling area for them all, which would allow the leaders to say a few words.

Quinn was aware that although they had agreed to this request they would most likely grab him right after, demanding an answer about him becoming their next King or not. Still, at least this had bought him peace and quiet until tomorrow when the ceremony would start.

Now, Quinn had returned to the throne room in the tenth castle and looked out of the large glass panel window again. It was here that Vincent had told him to look after the people, and having experienced his ancestor's life he had begun to feel a connection with these.

'Before I decide, I will need to know what is happening with the Cursed faction. Linda said that Sam would contact me when he needs to. Then I can make my decision, and of course I will need to see what they say and want me to do.'

'Like Fex said, I guess I just haven't realised that I am in a position where I can request whatever I want. However, will the vampires really listen to me?'

Just as Quinn had finished this thought, and before Vincent could answer him, another had come through the doors, and it was his only remaining Vampire knight, Leo.

"Quinn." Leo greeted him by bowing down, but Quinn quickly gestured for him to raise his head. Leo was one the people who he had great respect for, and never wanted him to bow down his head to him, no matter who Quinn had become.

"Quinn, I have some news to tell you. Perhaps I should have mentioned it earlier, but at the time I didn't want to trouble you and I thought that I perhaps knew best for them." Leo said.

Quite surprised by what Leo had to say, the two of them sat down at a table in the room and Quinn listened to what the Blind Swordsman said. He would always have and make time for this person. Still regretting that it was Quinn's fault he had been turned and chucked into this mess. Not once though, did Leo ever blame Quinn.

The news that Leo had to deliver was about Erin. He had informed the tenth leader about everything that had happened, and the struggles she had been facing, leading to her leaving out of her own volition.

"I see." Quinn replied. "Leo, I don't think anything you did was wrong. Honestly, I wouldn't even know what to do if I was put in your situation. If Erin went through the teleporter then she should have appeared on the Cursed faction ship. When Sam contacts me, I will ask him where she has gone from there.

"After all, I was the one that turned her, so she is my responsibility, you have already done too much in that regard. Leo, you are free to do as you wish. I know you have business with Pure, let me worry about this."

The two of them continued to have some light conversation, talking about what Leo had done on his journey and confirming a few things. Such as the fight Leo had with the Dalki along with Chris. Quinn figured that it was the same person that had trained him in Qi, and was actually quite happy that the two of them had fought together.

At the end of the day though, Chris was a member of Pure, which meant that it was likely that Quinn or the others would have to face him someday. After that, Leo stated that he would stay, at least until he knew that the tenth family would be able to run smoothly without him. He intended to help out in the war after that, before seeking out his own personal business with Pure.

After leaving, Quinn decides to ask Vincent a few questions.

'Is there anything we can do to help Erin? I know you don't know much about the Dhampir, but any little bit might help." Quinn asked.

'It is hard for me to say honestly.' Vincent replied. 'Stuck in this system there is only so much I can do. I've been thinking, maybe it is time for me to take you up on your offer, Quinn. Even if I was put into a clone body, it would do more good for me to be out there than to stay in here.

'I could see what I could do to help you. After all, if you are King, you will have access to all the facilities, everything will be at your disposal, as long as the council agrees, though as Fex said, with your power, as long as it's not too ridiculous it shouldn't pose a problem.'

'So…are you saying I should accept?' Quinn asked.

'I don't think that would be the worst choice.' Vincent replied.

At that moment, Quinn's mask started to vibrate. The call he had been waiting for, came at the perfect time. He was eager to get an update on the situation with the Cursed faction.

Alas, it wasn't good news.

*****

# Chapter 1372 - A Decision Made
Picking up the call, Quinn was quite happy to hear the sound of Sam's voice on the other end. He had no clue what had happened while he was away and wanted to ask about Logan and Mona, who had decided to head back to the Cursed ship while he headed to the vampire world.

However, the news that was delivered was nothing that Quinn had expected at all. He could tell it was hard for Sam to deliver the news. His voice cracked multiple times, Sam couldn't stop apologising on the other end for making the wrong decision. With each piece of new information, Quinn was starting to think whether or not he had made the right decision coming to this place.

Eventually, the call had ended, and there was no need for Quinn to head back to the Cursed faction planets or the ship immediately. That was the worst part of it all. It was because the time had already passed for Quinn to do anything.

Quinn stood there, in the throne room, in silence. He had his head held down and was frozen in place. He was like a statue and didn't know how long he had been there for, in the same position.

Eventually, he did something different. Both his fists were clenched, and a red aura started to surround the outside of his body. The red aura mixed with Qi, as Quinn wanted to let out every part of power inside him.

If one was to look closely, one could see that items on the table were shaking due to the sheer power that Quinn was summoning right now.

"ARGHHH!" Quinn shouted at the top of his lungs, his veins showing from his neck, and at the same time, red aura was released out from his body all around him.

As the aura hit the items on the table, they fell off, and at that moment, everyone in the castle could feel that the whole place was shaking. Those who were outside could even see the castle shaking and stopped to look.

"What's going on? Is there a fight going on in there!"

"Has that person returned, or maybe the tenth leader is in trouble!" The people panicked.

Seconds later, Timmy and Xander had to come out from the castle, along with the vampire soldiers, to calm down the situation.

"It is no trouble, people. Please go back to what you were doing. The tenth leader was just practising a new technique. As you can see, not even the mighty castle can hold his power." Xander reported.

This news satisfied the people, but everyone close to Quinn was worried about what had actually occurred.

'Why…why is this happening…why can't I ever seem to make the right decision.' Quinn thought back in his room.

There was no one to talk to. No one had entered, perhaps because they felt like Quinn just needed to take a break, but at least one person was with him.

'Quinn, I don't think you made the wrong decision. It's impossible to tell. Who knows what could've happened here if you weren't here and the ripple effect that would have.' Vincent replied. 'Trust me, in my lifetime, I constantly thought about what if I was to do things this way or that, but at the end of the day, we can't go into the past.

'What I would say is, do what you can now, with the position you are in.'

For some reason, the last words that Vincent said, was like an epiphany for Quinn. He still hadn't recovered from the news that he had received, but it was no time for him to be feeling sorry.

"I need a list."

——

A short while later, Leo had been called into the throne room. The look on his face wanted to ask Quinn what had happened. He felt the energy more than anyone due to his ability. Still, with the look that Leo could see now, he thought that perhaps there was no worry at all. Quinn's mind was clear with what he needed to do.

"Leo, I would like you to do me a favour. Head off with Linda towards the dragon in the lab. Once I'm done here, I'll travel to Linda and take the dragon with me. There's a chance that the Dalki could still attack this place.

"It might only be a matter of time until they find out that Arthur has failed his task."

Leo nodded and didn't ask any questions. He preferred leadership this way that was decisive and straight away went to inform Linda of their task.

——

The next day, the preparations for the ceremony in the pooling area were complete. The leaders dealt with the schedule, the temporary building of structures and more, and had sent some information to Quinn.

They had given him a time slot for when he would speak to the people, which was at the very end of the ceremony. Based on what he heard from those in the tenth castle, it was unavoidable for Quinn to do a speech. Everyone, not just those in the tenth family, was looking forward to it.

It was strange, but Quinn had been told that when he was to walk out the castle, that the vampire soldiers, which everyone referred to them as now, now that Paul was gone, were to escort him.

When Quinn left the castle to go to the pooling area, they had practically surrounded him, making it so no one could get close. It was only then since it was the first time Quinn had left the castle, he realised why this was needed.

"It's the tenth leader, the legendary vampire!"

"He was the one that saved us all. The shadow stopped the attack from hitting us in time."

"Tenth leader, please look my way, give me a wink!"

"Please let me thank you!"

The vampires were simply crazy. It reminded Quinn of those celebrities that would be hounded on the street.

'Look at all these people you helped, Quinn, and how appreciative they are of you. If it wasn't for you, they would be unable to put this type of smile on their face.' Vincent said.

——

As usual, Quinn was impressed by the work the vampires did. The pooling area was just a vast empty wasteland the last time he had seen it. Now, they had managed to set it up well, creating a large stage at the end just in front of the king's castle and places for the vampire leaders and new leaders to be placed.

Then, there were also coffins spread out in front of the stage. Inside, those with the bodies of all those that had died. Even though some didn't have a body to place in the coffin, they still made one out of respect.

The people from each of the families were made to stand as if they were attending a concert, and a wall was made of the black material just between the stage and the others. Not that the wall would stop the vampires if they wanted to, but it was to know where the vampires were allowed to be.

Then, all those Vampire knights and higher ranking vampires, including Quinn's large escort group was In the room behind the stage waiting for their turn.

At the moment, Sunny seemed to be a type of host to the event. Welcoming everyone and talking to them all.

What Quinn found impressive was there were crystals that were projecting her image and replicating it like a large tv to everyone all around. It was a reminder to Quinn that vampire technology was quite advanced.

They also had so many resources and secrets that they could use, but they just never chose to, always hiding here. All of the leaders were introduced and had time to talk. Quinn listened to them all.

The speeches sounded like they were mostly there to calm the people, to tell them everything was alright and that an event like this would never happen again.

Which just didn't sit quite right with Quinn.

"And now, everyone, the tenth leader would like to talk to you all. Our saviour of the vampire settlement." Sunny announced.

Quinn walked up to the stage, and the sound was thunderous coming from the crowd. The whole stage shook. It was unlike when any of the other leaders stood where Quinn was. Eventually, though, their leaders looked at them, emitting some sort of pressure that quickly got all the vampires to calm down.

Quinn stood there looking out at them all again, every single one of them listening to his words right now.

"The vampires that we lost in this fight. I was close to a lot of them. I'm not just talking about my vampire knight Paul either." Quinn said. "I knew Kazz, I knew Arthur, and I even knew Bryce through his good and bad. I hear a lot of you are calling me a hero.

"But honestly, these people who were willing to sacrifice their lives, they were the ones that should be called heroes. Without hesitation, they risked their lives to save each other. The settlement and people they cared for.

"They did something that I can't do. Bob, Tilart, Fiona, Lucas, Brian…"

The others were wondering what Quinn was doing at the moment as he went on to list a bunch of names. It lasted for about ten minutes. By then, some of the vampires in the settlement realised what Quinn had done, and their eyes started to tear up.

"These are the names of every single vampire that lost their lives in this fight. Let me tell you, this was no accident what happened today. You were attacked, and there is a good chance you could be attacked again, now or in the future, and I think some of you know that.

"But as long as we have people, people like those names I have said today, then we will be okay. I will not forget a single one of their names. As I take every single one of them with me, until the day I die. I will remember them and everyone after them."

The vampires didn't cheer after Quinn's speech. Instead, they were deep in thought. They didn't even understand why they had been attacked or what the fight was about. They knew nothing, and even now, the vampire leaders hadn't explained to them.

The tenth leader was the only one that had told them a partial truth, and they wanted to thank Quinn for that. To know the cause and the reason why their fellow vampires had died.

"I have one more thing to say to you all. Your leaders and all of you had bowed your heads down in front of me that day, and you asked me a question. Whether I would become your vampire king.

"And I have your answer for that now…"

*****

# Chapter 1373 - Do You Accept Me As Your King?
The leaders who were waiting in the back suddenly stood up from their seats as they waited to hear Quinn's answer. They had planned to talk to Quinn after the ceremony to discuss these matters. Muka had even planned a number of things to convince him, but it looked like they were all going to get their answer here and now.

Quinn looked at all of the vampires in the settlement listening to him carefully. They were hanging on to his every word.

"The answer is…yes," Quinn replied.

In an instant, the vampires started to cheer in joy. If anyone deserved to be the King, they all felt like it was the tenth leader. Not only was he the strongest vampire, but he was also their saviour, someone who brought them together, and those that were the happiest were the vampires from the tenth family.

They had spent years being suppressed by the other families but had felt a change ever since the new leader had appeared. There were hardly any vampires that were alive that could even remember the last time one from the tenth family had been selected as King.

Hearing this, behind the stage in the backroom, watching on the crystal monitor, the leaders heard everything and looked at each other. They wanted to see the reactions of each other. Some of them were left with their mouths wide open. Leaders such as Nicu and Jake were sure that Quinn would have declined.

They were trying to figure out ways to get the absolute blood control back from him. For one, Nicu even had a large crate by his side that contained Arthur's weapon. He thought it would be a good trade if need be. In the first place, although they knew Quinn suited the role of King, they just could never imagine him being one.

The cheers continued, but Quinn wanted to say more. Trying to calm them all down, Quinn started to focus on his Qi and shouted, amplifying his voice over all of theirs.

"BUT!!!" He shouted, silencing them in nearly an instant. "This is if you can accept me as King, as the King I wish to be."

Some of the leaders and knights scrunched up their faces hearing this comment. They knew there had to be a catch, and rather than discussing it with them. He had decided to publicly speak about it to the people.

"Should I stop him?" Sunny asked.

"No, let's hear what he has to say. I think he has a point. At the end of the day, we don't know what Quinn's wish is in all of this, and as King, we need to know his goal." Muka replied.

Pausing for a bit, Quinn realised that the others would allow him to continue to speak, and so he did.

"I'm sure some of you know about me or who I am, and there are some of you who will not. I was a human, a human that had been turned into a vampire, but one that had contained the Eno bloodline. Which was why I was able to become the leader of the tenth castle.

"I have been human for most of my life, and I have friends and people I call family that I care for. Human lives I care for, but here in front of me, I also have lives I care for. Vampires for who I feel the same way.

"If you wish for me to be your King, then you need to all accept this fact. At the moment, the humans are at war with a race called the Dalki. The same creatures that had attacked the vampire settlement. There is a good chance that it will happen again. The threat on the vampire settlement is not over, and I want you all to be aware of that.

"I…Have been living a double life, but I want to look after the vampires just as much as I do the humans. The humans already know about our existence, some are scared, and I'm sure some of you are scared, but…I want us to overcome this fear, so the two of us can see each other as equals.

"I don't wish for there to be a separation, and I want the two sides to support each other. This is my wish. If you do not agree with my wish or plan to go against it, then I am afraid I am not the right King for you."

Quinn had stopped speaking there, and it gave the vampires a moment to talk. Many of them started to talk amongst each other about what they had heard. The vampires had been secluded from the humans for so long. Only a few of them were able to go to the human world. Many of them didn't know what humans were like.

However, at the same time, leaving the settlement exploring a wider world with more people felt exciting to them. In contrast, it was scary for others, but most of the vampires could agree on one thing.

"Our life belongs to our king, you!" A vampire shouted. "If it wasn't for you, we wouldn't be standing here right now! I will do whatever you want!"

"Yeah, he's right! Look at what happened to us. Even under the old rule, we need change!"

"If we don't do anything about those Dalki, then they will come after us, won't they!"

Surprisingly to Quinn, many in the crowd were supportive. What Quinn didn't realise was that what had happened was such a shocking event to them all. The leaders that they had trusted in this fight were helpless. Many of them had died.

It had come as a complete shock to the settlement that had been peaceful for so long, and at that moment, Quinn was the one that was there. Which was why they were so willing to follow him. Especially since vampires valued strength greatly, and Quinn certainly had proved himself in that department.

"Alright, that was the speech from the tenth leader, everyone!" Sunny nervously ran onto the stage and started clapping. It was Quinn's cue to leave, and he could only think that perhaps the leaders weren't so keen on Quinn's idea.

A few passing words were said, and then all of the coffins were burnt. The vampires watched the fire in silence until all the smoke had disappeared, signalling it was the end of the ceremony.

The vampires headed back to their castles being directed by their knights, and as expected, Quinn had been called to a meeting with the others. The meeting was to take place in the room where all of the leaders were preparing and watching the ceremony from behind the stage.

It was a large place that looked similar to that of a ballroom. Inside there were glasses of blood in wine glasses and a large round table with a white cloth as if they were going to go for a high-class meal. Here, Quinn could see all the leaders, including unfamiliar faces of the new ones sitting there.

Going to the table, Quinn sat down confidently, without greeting any of them, as if this was a bothersome thing to do. He wanted to make it clear that he wasn't doing this just because they asked him to.

"So I accepted your request as King? But it looks like the leaders here haven't accepted me, right? Or the council, so what is it that you wanted to talk to me about?"

Quinn knew this because the quest to become the vampire king was still available in his system. He had thought after saying those words on the stage that the quest might have been completed. There could have been a few reasons why it was not.

Quinn needed to be accepted by the people, he had to go through the King's ritual, or he needed the council to accept him as their King as well.

"I have to admit, we were quite surprised by your speech there," Muka said. "Honestly, after listening to you, we realised that we always thought of you as a vampire like one of our own."

"But you have made it clear that you see yourself as something different!" Nicu interrupted, banging his fist on the table.

Immediately, Quinn went to look towards him and waved his hand. In that second, an invisible force was felt hitting Nicu, knocking him off the chair and slamming his head on the ground.

"Don't worry, he is alive. I just don't want anyone to interrupt when we are talking about an important matter." Quinn replied.

The other leaders who had been against Quinn, and also wanted to speak had decided to stay quiet. They hadn't even seen what he had done, and Nicu still hadn't come up from that single move. It was a reminder of how he was able to save the settlement in the first place.

"We just wanted to ask. We know you said you wanted to bring humans and vampires together, but what did you exactly mean by that? After all, you will be asking us to direct our families under you. So it would be good for us to know." Jin asked.

"I was planning to tell you all anyway, and you're right, I did have something in mind when I accepted being King, and it was why I said all that earlier on the stage.

"I want the vampires to help the humans in the war against the Dalki. This is my condition for me becoming your King."

*****

# Chapter 1374 - The Vote, And Power
The leaders had suspected that Quinn might use their request to help out the humans he cared about so much. It made sense after hearing the speech he had made, however they hadn't quite expected him to go so public with his plans. It was putting all of them in a difficult position and on the top of their toes.

The Vampire Lord had also just outright stated that the condition for him becoming their next King was to take part in a war that wasn't theirs in the first place. The first instinct of the newly elected and young leaders was to stand up and protest, but the tenth leader had already made an example out of Nicu.

Only one was brave enough to stand up to him.

"That is ridiculous!" A young looking female vampire scoffed at his words. Quinn looked at her, noticing her blonde hair, which was unusual since most vampires had black hair, which made him suspect that it was dyed.

"You are asking all of us to fight, just because of your personal interest! Right now, you are not our King and we all are at the same rank."

The other leaders were quite nervous about how Quinn was going to react, but unlike with the first family's leader, he remained calm.

"And who are you?" Quinn firstly asked.

This caused the woman's face to turn bright red, yet it was expected for Quinn to not really know who she was. He had been recuperating and only recently woke up.

"I'm Katori Cha, new leader of the second family."

"Well then that makes it easier." Quinn replied. "I believe it was because of the interests of your family in the first place that the settlements were in danger twice. Yet, it was because of my interest that I saved you all. However, I won't deny you having a point.

"I could just say that all of you owe me a favour, although I might not be a native vampire I have learned that etiquette demands that a favour always gets repaid, and based on the reactions from the people out there, they seem to be more inclined to stick to that than all of you.

"However, I would much prefer you agreeing to this willingly than me forcing you, so let me lay out everything clearly to all of you. At the moment I hold quite the high position in the Human World, you can think of it as the equivalent of a Royal Knight, without there being a King or maybe similar to the council with only three members. If there is anything you need from them in the future or information then I can easily obtain it.

"My condition wasn't one I placed on a whim. I have long since desired to bridge the gap between vampires and humans, only the current situation allows me to do it with your consent. In my opinion the vampires have tried to live secretly ignoring the human's existence for too long, giving rise to problems within the vampires and humans.

"There will always be disputes, of course. Humans argue with each other, yet vampires do as well, but at the moment both are facing the same enemy. On our own, neither side might stand a chance, but together I believe we can defeat them. For that, I want to use the resources in this solar system.

"On my way here, I have passed multiple beast planets. The humans are currently in dire need of crystals to continue fighting. At the same time, I heard from Fex that you have been gathering dangerous subclasses. Now, I don't know if any of you were aware, but it looked like Bryce has been planning to go to some type of war for a while now.

"Instead of killing them all, I suggest we use them to help us in the fight against the Dalki. I won't even ask you to take care of them, that can be the tenth family's responsibility. However, I do want the vampire leaders and their vampires to take part in it as well. That is my wish. For this to work, I need your power, not just mine."

None of the leaders said anything, even Muka who had felt like they could help Quinn in some way thought that the tenth leader was asking for too much, but there was one thing that was true. They owed him their lives, so wouldn't it be fair for them to fight with their lives on the line?

"I think some of your conditions are fair, but you are asking for too much." Katori argued. "The crystals and maybe the subclasses we can agree on, but for us to risk our lives? We have only just recovered from an attack of our own, and what should we do if Laxmus returns while we're away?"

At this point, Quinn had a big smile on his face, because he had been waiting for this. It was time for him to use his position, everything he had gained for this point.

"You're right, but let me ask you, even if you all stay here, what exactly do you plan to do if he attacks you again? I'm telling you now, in case you can't agree to my conditions, I won't stay in the vampire settlement. Me and the tenth family, as well as any vampire who wishes to accompany us, will leave for the Human World. I may be powerful, but I'm not omnipotent. I can only do my best in trying to protect my family, and those loyal to them… as for everyone else I don't have the luxury to care about them."

This was a worry that the other leaders hadn't thought about. If Quinn was to do this, would more vampires choose to follow him rather than them. Perhaps the inner castle vampires were loyal to their families but what about the pooling vampires. They had seen the reaction outside.

"Make no mistake, I'm the one holding out my hand to you guys not the other way round, you have no one that can defeat Laxmus even if he were to return on his own. I'm offering you protection, but in exchange I expect you to fight, for your sake as well as the people I care about…

"I'm sure some of the older leaders are aware that the Dalki have been created by the vampires in the first place, and that they had attacked you alongside Arthur. There is a reason why I haven't chosen to simply leave, and it's because I really do need your help.

"Do you know why Arthur was working with the Dalki? Before his demise he confessed to me that he chose their side, because he claimed to be weaker than them. His last regret was that I proved to him that he might have been wrong and that there was no hope for the vampires or the humans. If we don't stop the Dalki now, they will come for you as well."

Although Quinn's words spoke his words with conviction, he actually wasn't so sure about the last part. With the Dragon gone, was there any reason for them to attack the vampires? The one that seemed to have wanted revenge on them more than anyone was Jim, yet according to his system he should be dead.

Nevertheless, the Dalki hadn't stopped their invasion of the human planets, and Quinn had seen how aggressive they could be. Perhaps it was just in their nature to be this way, an urge to kill anything different from them.

"Quinn, I think what you said is right, but there is one problem." Jake brought up, a little afraid that he might get hit. "The Punishers were created to be an equal force to the King. In case anything happened like it did before, we would have relied on them.

"After that, the council was supposed to have just as much power as the King. The King was the person selected by the council, yet we could still overturn his decision. We have many traditions and I was wondering about a few things.

"First, would you be willing to follow our ways? You have become so strong that no one can overthrow you, and right now you have the power of the Punisher and the Absolute Blood Control skill, meaning if you wished to rule over us with an iron fist, there would be no one to stop you. Another thing, you only spoke about your plans for the war, but what do you plan to do after that. If we help you and we win, will you still be our King?"

Surprisingly, the other leaders nodded and agreed with what Jake was asking, even the ones that wanted Quinn to join them no matter what. It was questions they wanted to ask, but thought maybe it was best to deal with after.

"What you are asking is fair and I have thought about it." Quinn answered. "First, I'm not familiar with all of your traditions, but I also don't want to come in here and change your vampire ways. I think I would need to deal with them, on a case by case basis.

"For your remark about me being too strong, that I combine two great powers, the thing is, right now, I need both of these powers to fight our enemy, especially if Laxmus was to return, so my plan for this will link into your last question.

"I need the vampire leaders' strength. The Dalki aren't large in number, just like the vampires but great in strength. After you help me achieve my goal, then I will be happy to give up the Absolute Blood Control . Perhaps we can set up a system like the Punishers of old but with the Absolute Blood Control instead of the Shadow powers.

"And lastly, I think it's important for me to keep my role as King, as long as you wish for me to do it. You all put your trust in me, and you all helped me, so I will continue to serve all of you."

The leaders smiled at Quinn's answer. They thought they were appropriate answers to everything, even better than they had hoped, Quinn seemed to be a resathetic person, one of the most reasonable they had ever met.

"We will then cast a vote, all those in favour of Quinn Talen, the tenth leader becoming the new king, please raise their hand." Muka asked.

Everyone at the table raised their hand, even Katori, but Nicu was unable to, still passed out.

"It seems like we have come to a unanimous decision. We welcome you, Your Majesty." Muka bowed down, the others following suit.

[Quest: Become the Vampire King completed]

[You will now receive your rewards.]

*****

# Chapter 1375 - The Power Of A King
It had been a long time since Quinn had received the quest. The quest to become the vampire king. It had arrived after the King before Bryce had decided to go into eternal slumber. At the time, Quinn thought that the system was just setting him up with an unachievable goal. The system had been known to do a few strange things, so why not this as well. Or at least he never thought it would be this soon that the quest would be complete.

Which was why he was expecting some pretty big rewards.

[You will now receive the following rewards]

[You have earned a new title]

[King of the vampire settlement]

[Summoning skill has been upgraded]

That was it. There weren't many messages for a quest that had taken so long to complete, and there only seemed to be two rewards.

'I have also stopped getting the instant level up reward as well. I didn't get anything when facing Laxmus either. After Eno did a full unlock of the system, it seems to have become rather stingy these days.'

What Quinn was most disappointed after seeing the messages was that he still hadn't completed the quest to become something beyond a vampire lord.

'It would have felt like an impossible quest if I didn't receive that notification for it not too long ago.' Quinn thought but decided to look on the upside and check out his rewards.

[Title: King of the vampire settlement.]

[As King, the area under your control has increased. The King is able to select the area in which he controls. Moving it where he wishes. Reputation points can now be earned from all of those in the vampire settlement. Reputation points can also now be used within the territory]

After reading its effects, it looked like a better version of the leader title. Checking out the system, Quinn could see that the area he could now cover was a little larger than the whole settlement. A small space just outside where the castles were set, but it also covered the pooling area.

On the map, he could see that just like with his own family area, he could upgrade the castle itself, place towers, and there were even a few more options he didn't have before.

'I can make this whole settlement into an unstoppable fortress!' Quinn thought. 'But it says I can change the King's area to a different place. Do I really want to set up such a place here? Maybe it's better to set something like this on earth, or even one of the Cursed faction planets?'

'I think there is no need to worry about that.' Vincent replied. 'Remember how I said the vampire settlement used to be on earth. Well, I think the reason why this place looks almost exactly as I remember it is because they moved it in some way.

'Although I am not quite sure how they did it, I'm sure they will have a way to move it again. So if need be, you could still increase the strength of this place to move it at a later time.'

Knowing this, Quinn just needed to ask to make sure.

"If there was ever the need to move the settlement, is that possible?" Quinn asked.

The other leaders were still at the table. Now that Quinn was their King, it was rude for them to leave before he did, so they just sat there while he was deep in thought, not knowing what he was doing and too afraid to ask.

"Yes, there was a mechanism built into the castles and system," Muka answered. "However, there are a few things that need to be done. For one, there are items that need to be placed in the area you wish to move the settlement too. The second thing is, it takes up a lot of energy and a while to transfer everything and everyone. A lot of crystals, to be more specific.

"After you move, the mechanism can't be used again straight away. It will take a while to move again even if you have enough crystals."

Once again, the vampire's technology never ceased to fail in amazing Quinn. The things they had figured out how to do with beast crystal was almost magical to them.

"How long is a while?" Quinn asked.

"Around a week for the mechanism to cool down. If it was an emergency, I'm sure you could force it, but then there's a chance that the mechanism would no longer work after that."

Quinn had gotten his answer, and it looked like Vincent was right. He could upgrade the settlement as he wished for now, and if he wanted to move it in the future, he could. With his Title, he wasn't restricted to just the land where they were either.

'This title might be more helpful than I thought, but I guess that depends on the reputation points I have at the moment.'

[Current reputation points: 120,345]

'Well, it looks like I won't have any problems in that department. Has it been increasing while I was away every day, or is it just because of what I have done and how I've become King?'

Regardless, Quinn decided to check out his next reward, which was his summoning skill that had been upgraded. As the tenth leader Quinn was able to summon his vampire knights to his side, so he wondered what he could do with it now.

When seeing this message, he nearly choked on the air itself and started coughing; he was so surprised.

"Your majesty, is there something wrong!" Muka quickly offered to help Quinn.

"Everything is fine. You guys can leave. I'm just going to be making a few changes, so make sure that the vampires don't get so alarmed." Quinn said, giving his first order, and the others were ready to leave.

"Quinn," Muka said before leaving. "There are still things we need to discuss, such as the Royal knights and when exactly you plan to do these things. Usually, your Royal knights would help you out with such tasks, or your old vampire knights, but you don't have either or anyone that is knowledgeable enough.

"In the meantime, I will do my best to fill that role. So if there are any questions or help you need from me, then please go ahead and ask."

Quinn was inclined to take up Muka on that offer because there were a lot of things he needed to know before he could move ahead. There was no Sam that could do that for him here.

"Also, I would suggest you start thinking about who would be the next leader of the tenth family as well."

When all of the leaders finally left, Quinn looked at the system again to make sure he wasn't imagining things.

'How do I explain this to them?' Quinn thought.

[Summon Upgraded: You are now able to summon any of the vampire family leaders to your side]

Looking at the list, Quinn could tell it was no joke as all of their names appeared. Quinn was tempted to use it on one of the leaders to test it out but had decided against it. The only downside was, it looked as if Quinn could no longer summon his vampire knights.

Still, being able to summon any of the leaders, and all of them at once if he wished, was definitely an upgrade in his eyes. The only thing was, he thought it would be best to warn them what they could suddenly get involved in if he was to do such a thing.

'So…this is it, this is what it feels like to be king.' Quinn said.

Getting up from the seat, Quinn left the room and walked out to the stage. He could see the pooling area hadn't been rebuilt to what it was, some of the castles were damaged, and because of him, there wasn't even much of a Royal castle itself, but now, all of this was Quinn's to look after.

'I guess it's time to improve this place.'

[Title has been changed]

[Title: 'King of the Vampire settlement' Is now active]

'Let us make some upgrades around here.'

[Reputation shop opened]

……

…

'Vincent, you said you wanted to come back, right? how do you feel about becoming the tenth leader again?'

******

# Chapter 1376 - The Settlement Upgrade
When Quinn had first gotten the system, the first thought in his head was that it seemed to resemble the old games people used to play all the time when the earth was not in danger of being overrun by the Dalki. Unfortunately, using the system had never felt like a game to him, especially since it was his life on the line all the time and unlike those games there was no do over.

However, today he would have to change his mind about the game aspect of it all.

Looking at the Reputation shop Quinn could see a number of things he could do, so he immediately started to get to work. His finger was moving non stop placing things around the map without even looking at the cost of what he purchased. As long as the name of that thing sounded useful he clicked on it, placing it down.

However, that wasn't the end of it. Most of the things he purchased could be further upgraded, leading him to spend even more of his Reputation points.

As Quinn continued to splurge, buildings, towers, and gargoyles were being built on the fly all over the settlement. The castle of every family seemed to be rumbling as more and more structures appeared out of nowhere as if they were magic.

"What is going on?!" One vampire shouted in confusion and fear, as they saw a tower being formed from the ground in front of their family area.

"Look over there as well!" Another one yelled, pointing towards a weird cannon that appeared in the middle of the wall. The vampires soon realised that the structures that they could see had a striking resemblance to the ones they had seen by the tenth family area.

"It must be the King! He has blessed us with another miracle!!!"

The noise from the pooling vampires and news about what was going on had soon spread to the vampire leaders. It hadn't been long since they had left Quinn on his own, and it would be hard for them to miss what exactly was going on outside. As they stared outside their castle, they could see their castle walls being strengthened in front of their very eyes and other changes taking place.

'Is this what he meant…when he was talking about making sure that the vampires weren't to get scared?' Sunny thought.

Eventually, the buildings and structures that had started constructing themselves out of nowhere had come to a halt. However, the Vampire settlement looked like a completely different place compared to just a few minutes ago.

The pooling area houses that had been destroyed during Arthur's attack had been rebuilt and seemingly even improved. The black jagged surface that had been used to build the previous iteration of houses before was no more, and there was an improvement on the pavement and more.

Seeing this was simply frightening for many of the leaders. They had known Quinn to be powerful, but this ability was unbelievable, especially at this scope. Meanwhile, the one responsible for it all had the biggest smile on his face, because he too couldn't believe his eyes.

In mere minutes, it was as if he had upgraded the settlement into a city.

'This whole thing…it really feels like a game, but the structures there are real!'

After seeing how much he had done, Quinn was worried that he might have gone a bit crazy spending all of his Reputation points. However, now that he checked them out, he was left speechless for a completely different reason.

'What's going on? Why haven't they gone down?' Looking at it a little longer he soon could see that the number had not only not decreased but it had actually increased and was still going up at this very moment.

'Is this some type of bug?'

Trying to figure out what was going on, Quinn could soon hear noise from the vampires in the settlement. Closing his eyes he tried to focus carefully on what they were saying. That's when he understood what had happened.

"It has to be the new King! The tenth leader did the same to his own castle and now that he is King, he is improving the whole settlement!"

"I told you he was the best choice for King! Look, with these towers and gargoyles, we will be safe from any attack!"

"But how? Didn't the tenth leader claim that he was born a human? How does he have the tenth family's power if he has the shadow power?"

This was a question that many vampires wanted an answer to, but as long as it benefited them then why did they need to care so much. Quinn was on their side, and he was holding up his side of the deal to protect them.

Turning around looking behind him, now knowing that he hadn't spent all of his points there was one more thing he was looking to do.

On the map itself, there was also the option to use points to repair structures, and although the King'sl Castle wasn't a structure that had come from the system. Quinn was able to use around 50,000 reputation points for its repair.

"This should keep those leaders happy as well." Quinn thought.

Selecting the repair option, the castle started to rebuild itself from the ground up. It looked as if someone had put a video in reverse. Then, the large hole he had made started to be filled with a strange glowing energy. Once the glow disappeared it was fully repaired.

'This has to be due to your ability mixing with the system, right? Otherwise how is this possible?' Quinn asked.

'I'm thinking the same thing.' Vincent replied.

It was strange to say, but Quinn didn't feel tired at all. Nevertheless, he decided to rest in the tenth castle. He could see vampires already leaving the inner castle area to have a look at the improvements in the pooling area.

Rather than call the vampire soldiers to help him, Quinn opted to use his Shadow travel. He was afraid that if he encountered any of the pooling vampires, they would practically hop on him and never let him go.

Back at the castle, Quinn had received an update from Leo that the Dragon was all okay. He then decided to call in Xander and Timmy to have them share as much information about the vampires as they knew.

In the end, their information was severely limited due to their low position. If he wanted to know about everything the settlement had to offer, then there seemed to be no way around contacting Muka.

A little while later, and each of the leaders had decided to make an announcement to their own people about Quinn having accepted the role as being their official King. They could have guessed already, but the confirmation put a smile on their faces, making some of the leaders jealous.

—

The next day, Quinn requested for Muka to appear before him to give him the answers and questions he wanted. He seemed to be the most open compared to the other leaders. Always willing to talk and more than anything accepted the changes that were needed in the settlement.

At the moment, the two of them were having a type of tour, as Muka showed the map's tunnels and explained details and history about the vampires. A lot of it was a bore through.

"The leaders will inform the people about what you have decided. It's not wise to hastily tell the public that they will be going into another war after what happened, but right now you have a lot of momentum on your side." Muka explained. "At the same time we will not wait too long, and I believe you won't want to wait long either."

Quinn had been getting frequent updates about the situation back with the humans. At the moment the fighting had come to a bit of a standstill, neither side seemingly willing to do a full push just yet. One side had already done that, the Dalki were clearly waiting for something, maybe for news from Arthur, but Quinn could use this time to get everything they needed.

Using the vampires would surely be a surprise, and when Quinn arrived with them, he wanted to give the Dalki a big push, so they would be unprepared for whatever was going to happen.

Muka had taken Quinn to the storage facility, showing them crystal weapons and more .He had then shown the King footage of the subclass that had been captured for use. They had a camera operating on each of the rooms.

The forces were even larger than Quinn had imagined, which was good news for a change, and afterwards he was finally being taken to the research lab. The building was located in the eighth family area. They had a big facility, yet ever since the family had been disbanded they were able to make it even bigger than before using the empty space.

Walking through its large halls, there was technology shown to Quinn that he had never seen before. He didn't understand much of it, to him it just looked like cool gadgets, similar to Logan's many rooms, but there was one person who was with him who was over the moon to see such things and wouldn't shut up about it…Vincent.

"I wanted to ask, have you thought about the position of the Royal Knights and the tenth leader yet?" Muka asked. "Before we move out, it would be best to fill in those positions. Although you are a strong King, it is almost impossible to micromanage so many people. A leader needs to know how to delegate."

"Yes… but there is something I still haven't seen yet." Quinn replied.

After looking around the research room, finally they had gone down to the basement floor. Here the doors had been sealed more so than the others. Walking through one set of doors, they shut behind, and now the two of them were in some type of metallic tube with another set of doors in front of them.

It reminded Quinn of the old spaceship designs.

"I'm sorry but this is necessary, if you wish to go here." Muka apologised.

Quinn nodded, he was sure he wanted to go in here, in fact he was really only interested in three things. The vampire's supplies, the dangerous subclasses and this. As soon as the second set of doors slid open, the waft of smell immediately hit his nose. He could smell it, the smell was so sweet that even he thought he was being affected by it slightly…it was the smell of blood.

"This is where we get our human blood from, the place you wished to see." Muka said, bowing down nervously, for what Quinn might do about what he would find.

*****

# Chapter 1377 - An Upgrade
As the two walked in, a similar sight to what Quinn had seen before was in view. There were a number of large glass containers identical to those in the lab where the Dalki were created. Only they weren't creating Dalki here; they were creating humans. Floating in the glass tube were lifeless bodies. Multiple tubes were inserted into different parts, drawing blood out and sending it to another place.

This was the lab where they created their blood substitute, and there was a reason why Quinn wanted to see this place.

'The Dalki actually show variation from each other. I guess Jim was trying to create a new species or new life using the beast's energy, but these clones are all exactly the same.' Quinn thought.

Seeing that Quinn's instant reaction wasn't one of anger, Muka still decided that it would be best for him to explain a few details.

"It's not as inhuman as it looks," Muka explained, worried that Quinn's former race might influence his choice. "Although we have the ability to create human clones that are fully functional and walking, they wouldn't last long, and it would be against some of the vampire's consciousness if that was the case.

"Here, we simply clone their bodies, the bones, the insides, create the marrow, and so on. We create everything necessary for the creation of blood. Essentially we only create the parts that we need. There is no brain, so the person isn't conscious, nor do they experience any pain. The brain is an important part of keeping the body functioning, so they have to be kept in the glass tubes as a replacement. If they left the tubes, they wouldn't last long outside."

Looking at the floating bodies that were said to be lifeless, Quinn felt sorry. Each one of them had the same face of the same man. This man had gone on to become the Vampires' food source, but it was because of what they were doing down here that they no longer had any need to rely on feasting on humans.

'You know why I wanted to come down here, although I was somewhat interested in what they were doing, there is another reason.' Quinn asked, speaking in his head.

Of course, Vincent knew, and it was all about the question Quinn had asked before.

'Honestly, as I told you, I had parted ways with the vampire world and accepted my death. I waited for death, but I feel partial blame for all of this. The book was my fault. Even if Richard was the mastermind behind it, I took part in it.

'Jim…I also feel like I could have stopped him. Which is why, if it is to help you, I do not mind taking the role of the tenth leader again, and with you as King now, there shouldn't be many problems with you doing that.'

The answer was what Quinn was hoping for, it had been a long time, but it looked like he would finally see the person who had helped him from the beginning right in front of his eyes.

'It looks like they can create a body for you? You wouldn't mind being human, would you?' Quinn joked. Still thinking about the answer Vincent had given him earlier.

'I don't think being human would be beneficial to you.' Vincent replied. 'If they are able to clone a human and have the same type of process with the Dalki, then surely they would be able to clone vampires as well. Logan now has the knowledge left behind by Richard, and he and Jim could create vampires. With him and me working side by side, I'm sure we can create something, maybe even a clone that can last a bit longer.'

According to Richard, a clone's lifespan was short, and it didn't seem like they had the ability to learn abilities. However, Quinn always thought that they could just create another clone if need be for Vincent to go in.

Although they were technically getting rid of a life, since they needed a fully functional clone, this was just a copy of Vincent's own life which felt less bad in a way, especially if the clone was happy to give his life for the real one in the first place.

The other worry they had was if removing Vincent from the system would affect the system in some way. Currently, he had powers beyond the system's understanding. When using the blood control or the shadow, he no longer used the system.

Now, the system was just showing him a bunch of numbers to indicate how powerful he had gotten. Worst case, they would just use Shiro's ability to try and place Vincent back in the system.

'I also don't think it will be a problem anyway, ever since using the Demon tier amulet. The system and Vincent are less linked than I Originally thought.'

"Do the bodies deteriorate?" Quinn asked.

"Yes," Muka replied. "We keep them alive as long as possible, but cloning for some reason causes the cells to produce more rapidly than a regular person. I'll be honest with you, Quinn, although these clones can last a few years, we decided to end their life quicker than that.

"I think you might already know, but we have other uses for a human body other than just their blood. Since we can create more, and we don't see this as doing harm, we use their body parts to feed some of the subclasses."

That certainly explained the bodies Quinn had seen when he arrived at Richard's suspected lab. He remembered seeing limb after limb and countless dead bodies. Either Eno was doing the same thing, or it was easy for him to take bodies from the lab.

The two continued looking around, and it really did remind Quinn of the Dalki lab. Once again, Vincent was more interested in the technology used. This was originally his job. To find a blood substitute, but he had never succeeded.

So he was interested in knowing how they had managed to succeed. Which was why Quinn started to follow the tubes coming out from the containers. They were not only draining blood, but energy was being supplied from somewhere and something.

Following along it eventually led them to the back of the lab. The tubes were all leading to a single source of energy that was kept more secure. There was a glass wall that was placed in between the room they were in and the item. So one couldn't just walk over and disturb or grab what was in front of them.

A podium could be seen, and on the very top, there was a single crystal, but it was one like they had never seen before.

'What…is that?' Quinn thought.

"That is what allowed us to create all of these, the source of their energy," Muka said, not having heard Quinn's thoughts but thinking he could guess what he was thinking.

'I think Logan briefly mentioned a different type of Crystal, but I left in a hurry to come here, so I didn't have time to speak to him about it. Is this the crystal he was on about?'

Looking through the crystal, it looked like he was looking at a small universe inside of it. The energy was drawing him in, and it was constantly shifting. The insides were moving, and Quinn wanted to reach out and touch it.

"If you remove the crystal, then unfortunately, all of these clones in here would be the last. We would have no way to create more." Muka said.

Although Quinn was sure if he ordered for them to give the crystal, they might comply, he wasn't going to do anything as drastic as that, but his interest had reached a peak, so Quinn did the one thing he could do without touching it.

[Inspect]

[Nest crystal]

'It is the crystal that Logan talked about, the nest crystal. The crystal beasts obtain their power from.'

There was no other information from the nest crystal. Still, it did trigger something in Quinn's system after using his inspect skill on it.

[Optional quest received]

[You are now able to consume the Nest crystal in order to upgrade the system!]

'Upgrade, you can be upgraded? Vincent, what is this?'

*******

# Chapter 1378 - A Proposal
Once again, Muka was left staring at his King as he just looked into space. Being around Quinn for a while now he noticed that he did this quite often and was wondering what on earth he was doing.

Right now, it didn't seem like he was looking at the crystal but was looking at something else entirely.

'Maybe this is the secret to his great strength? I should just observe.' Muka decided.

Right now, Quinn was looking for some type of answer from his system, to try to figure out what exactly this upgrade would be. The last time this happened, Vincent had been introduced to him so he thought maybe Vincent would know something about it. As usual, the system didn't actually expand on anything, so his only hope was his ancestor.

'I'm sorry Quinn, but I don't know much either. I hate that I can't give you answers.' Vincent replied with a sigh. 'The system has evolved way beyond my comprehension. Still, I think it's a good thing. This is the first Quest it has given you ever since you received Eno's gift.

'I can only guess that this will help you become something beyond that of a vampire lord, or perhaps the system will allow you to get even stronger than what Richard Eno had intended. Maybe you're not at your limit after all.'

There was only one way to find out, and that was to consume the crystal as the Quest demanded. The name itself didn't make it sound like there could be any downsides, but the Vampire Lord did remember the horrible feeling he had gone through when absorbing the energy from the fourteenth castle.

'I can't use this Nest crystal, at least not until I find a replacement for them.'

"Do you have any more of these Nest Crystals?" Quinn asked.

"Unfortunately not. Finding this one alone was pure coincidence, and there wasn't really much need for a replacement. As you might know, our exploration these days has dwindled down. If you wish, we could gather a team to explore the beast planets. This way we can deal with two of your tasks. One to look for another nest crystal, and two, to gather crystals for the human forces."

It certainly was a good idea, and doing something like this also wouldn't alarm the vampires. If Quinn just stated he needed to gather crystals.

"Great, please select a family that is best suited for this role… Hang on. Actually, relay my wish of wanting to explore the beast planets in hopes of finding such a crystal to all of the families apart from yours. I wish to see which one is more keen for the job." Quinn ordered. "I'll be using this lab a lot more in the foreseeable future and will also bring some members of the Cursed faction over. Don't worry I won't be doing anything to disrupt what you currently have going on."

Muka bowed, understanding that to be his cue to leave. He gave Quinn the passcodes to doors and was on his way to talk to the others. Overall, things had gone relatively well. He especially appreciated the new King merely stating his request, while allowing the council to decide things between themselves.

'Why did you make that request?' Vincent asked.

'About letting them choose a family?' Quinn clarified. 'Well, I thought it would be best to find out which of the leaders are keen to impress me at the moment. The pooling and castle vampires may accept me as their King but the ones that hold the real power in this settlement are still the leaders. They have no choice but to accept me, so I just want a clear image of who might choose to turn on me.

'After all, for all we know Laxmus might already be in the midst of creating his own vampire settlement. If they really hated being under my rule that much, they would have the chance to defect over to him. There's also the problem with all the other Originals that are still underground. Who knows what their agenda is.'

'You're learning Quinn.' Vincent said, putting a smile on the other's face.

'Now there is something else I need to do.' Quinn stated and soon his body turned into nothing but shadows. The next place he appeared from was in front of the Demon tier beast, the Dragon. Linda and Leo were currently present acting as guards, yet now the King finally had time to sort out this problem.

"Has there been any trouble?" Quinn asked.

Getting up from the ground Leo walked over towards him.

"No, there hasn't been anything. So much so that I even decided to scout the mountain area nearby. Not too far away from here was where me and Erin first discovered the Dalki. I assume they were looking for this place, but Arthur must have already known about it.

"It makes me wonder whether they know about it or not."

And that was exactly the reason why Quinn needed to solve this problem. The Dragon here had always been in a strange state. Looking at it, it reminded Quinn of the bodies that he had just seen not too long ago. It was as if it was alive but was lacking a consciousness.

"I hope this works." Quinn thought, lifting up his arm.

The next second, a large shadow was cast over the dragon, and could be seen being pulled into it. It disappeared and was successfully placed in the Shadow space.

"What if you need the shadow for your fight?" Linda asked. She knew a bit more about the Shadow ever since learning how to use the ability as well.

Hearing this question, Quinn put a smile on his face.

"It's okay, it didn't take that many MC points."

What he said was true because to contain the whole Dragon, it had taken around 2,000 of Quinn's MC points. It was just a small drop compared to what he had at the moment. The problem would have been, whether or not he would be able to contain the Dragon.

If it had been the other half they had seen on Blade Island, he was sure it would have taken a lot of his MC points to contain it from breaking out, but this one remained as lethargic in the Shadow space as it had done outside.

'I wonder if anyone knows more information about the Dragon. Some of the leaders had fought against it to bring it in. So they must have had a way. If it comes down to it, maybe there is a need to wake up some of the Originals and rely on their strength… If we can trust them that is.'

——

A little while later, and in the tenth castle, two people could be seen appearing through the teleporter that stayed in the throne room. Their was no reason to move it to the royal castle, and ever since it had been rebuilt it was empty. Muka had informed him they were waiting for him to select the royal guard and Royal knights for them.

As for the two people that entered, one was shorter than the other, and the other male wasn't too much taller. Surprisingly, the taller one was the older of the two. These two were Logan and Shiro.

"I can't believe it, I'm in a castle looking at everything here!" Shiro gasped in shock, twisting and turning his head. "This is crazy, like I know Quinn is a vampire but for there to be an entire world of vampires and stuff."

"I see you two made it over safely. I'm glad to see that you seem well and are unhurt." Linda greeted the two of them. She had returned along with Leo since there was no longer any need for them to look after the Dragon.

When hearing these words from Linda though, the happy expression that Shiro had borne, disappeared.

"Come on, I'll give you a little tour of this place." Linda offered as the atmosphere had turned awkward. "And then we'll go ahead and meet Quinn."

Shiro's excitement soon returned as everything was a new experience for him. The castle had a design that looked like things he had only seen in history books, then at the same time there were new technologies that he had never seen before. It was a strange mixture to say the least.

Meanwhile, Logan was excited to get to work, because Quinn had already informed him of why the two of them had been called beforehand, and he had also brought along his little gift he had received from Eno for completing the trial, the Nest Crystal.

After the tour was over, Linda escorted the two of them to a special lab, and here they could see Quinn waiting for the two of them.

'So, how long do you think you're going to need?' Quinn asked.

"I already have the knowledge to do everything up here. I can get started straight away, are there any special requirements that you might have?" Logan replied with a confident grin.

Thinking about it, there was a proposal that Quinn had been thinking about.

"Yeah, see if you can create a permanent clone, and…what about making a clone of me?"

*****

# Chapter 1379 - A Collection
After specifying his request all Quinn could see was a big smile on Logan's face. After acquiring a few samples of the Vampire Lord's blood, along with a few other things, Logan started to go to work.

He claimed that the whole process could take a while. Just making some clones would be easy enough, but actually improving one to make it 'complete' was a bigger task. The scientist would first have to run some tests on the Nest Crystal.

He was after all, attempting to do something that not even Richard had done, but would use the information to help him.

That was when Quinn found out that Logan had his own Nest Crystal, now there were two. One that made the human clones for human blood and the one Logan had. However, he stated that it was needed to create a better clone.

"It looks like you have confidence then, but I was actually wondering if we should use the Nest Crystal to create multiple clones? That's how Richard and Jim were able to create their army, right?" Quinn asked.

While Logan was typing information away and looking at certain numbers he was replying to Quinn, but Shiro was left bored not really doing anything.

"Humans have never lacked in numbers. There's far more of us than the Dalki, and with the Vampires' help we will have even more. Unfortunately, our numbers matter little to them. Quinn, the problem is that the Dalki are getting stronger far faster than us.

"You heard Sam's report, right? When looking at Jim and Richard's clones they were nowhere near the strength of the original, but I plan to change that. What we need more than anything is power."

Quinn wanted to ask more, but he stopped himself from talking about the incidents that happened on Earth while he was away.

'I guess there will just have to be an order to these things. First create a body for you, then if we find another Nest Crystal on one of those beast planets, upgrade the system and finally use the last one to create more clones. I understand what Logan is saying, but if we can even stop one more person from having to die, then it's worth it in my eyes.' Quinn thought.

Since Logan said it would take him a long time, possibly a few days even, Quinn decided that there were other things he could attend to. Before leaving though, he had taken Shiro with him, and told Linda to escort him around the settlement, to silently look after him.

Then there was a certain place that Quinn wanted to visit. He had found out that a certain family had claimed a weapon that he didn't feel like belonged to them.

Soon, Quinn found himself in front of the 1st family castle. As he walked through the doors, the vampires all bowed as there was no need for the King to make an appointment. The vampires were actually happy to see him.

Another perk about being the Vampire King was nobody would ever dare to jump on Quinn, even though some of them clearly wanted to. Instead, they just stayed there, respectively bowing until he passed them.

Eventually, Quinn made it to the person he was looking for, a young leader who was in his room being served by four vampire servants, all female. Each one was dressed skimpily, their clothes leaving little to the imagination, and they were in the midst of putting on clothes on a young man.

"Can you not even dress yourself?" Quinn announced his presence with a light chuckle.

The female vampires straight away bowed down to the King, stopping what they were doing, leaving Nicu with a half unbuttoned shirt revealing the top half of his chest. Eventually, Nicu bowed down as well, hiding his disgruntled look.

"Your Majesty, there was no need for you to come here, if you had only called I would have arrived in a heartbeat." Nicu claimed.

"Oh, it's no bother, really. I don't plan to stay long. I merely came because it came to my ears that the first family has laid claim not only to Bryce's cain sword, but also Arthur's Blood Sword. While I won't deny you your heritage, Arthur was a friend of mine, and as the only remaining Punisher, I would just like what is rightfully mine." Quinn saw no need to talk around the topic. He wasn't requesting the sword back, he was telling Nicu to return what belonged to him.

"But Your Majesty!" Nicu protested nervously, worried that he might be hit again. Their last meeting had left some fear in his heart for this outlier. "The first family has suffered immensely during that last attack. A lot of the leaders and families no longer have power that they did before.

"I have never seen Your Majesty use a sword. Wouldn't you agree that such a fine sword deserves to be used?"

"On that I fully agree." Quinn nodded, surprising the young leader. "However, it will be up to me as for who I deem to be that worthy someone. Now tell me where it is, or do you wish to make your King look for it himself?"

Nicu couldn't hold back his anger again. He had been trained by his father to follow the vampires' traditions, all of the families had heirs who had been trained from birth, and this outsider who knew nothing about vampires had suddenly become King didn't even know he was walking lightly over them all.

If he was to get hit again, then so be it.

"You are just abusing your power! Didn't you claim you wanted to be different from the other Kings?!" Nicu shouted at him in frustration. Quinn paused for a second, while the female vampires by Nicu's carefully stepped away from him, worried about what might happen next.

"Of all the surviving families, your's is the one who has the least right to complain about how I do things." Quinn stared down at him with immense anger. "In case you've forgotten, it was due to YOUR father that Arthur attacked the settlement.

"Just as it was under YOUR father that the lives of innocent vampires had been sacrificed and that includes my family as well as your own. Imagine, if you were taken, told to sacrifice your life. Just because you were born his son, it never happened to you, you have lived your life with no fear.

"Imagine if Bryce was still King and one of the other leaders had done the same things he did. Now look me in the eyes and tell me whether you believe YOUR father would allow such a family to exist for even a day after discovering such a heinous crime! We both know, he would have claimed that all the vampires in the family were at fault for not stopping their leader.

"Yet I haven't punished any of you."

Quinn then moved his hand outward and spread his fingers. Nicu was waiting for something to happen, and a short while later they could hear noise. Suddenly something crashed through the floor and what appeared in his hands was the large greatsword.

"Good thing there was still a bit of blood on the sword. Seems like I didn't really need your help, after all." Quinn stated, turning away, but stopped just when half of him had disappeared into a shadow.

"Your sister was a good person, Nicu. She followed the rules, and cared about her family no matter what. I hope that in the future you can become more like Kazz rather than Bryce. Instead of just caring about the first family, why not try to see all the leaders as part of your family?"

With that Quinn left, and placed the Blood sword in his dimensional space.

Still, Quinn did wonder what would be the best thing to do with the sword. Despite his young age, he did have a point. He wasn't a swordsman, but the Blood sword and its powers went well with the Blood armour he wore.

'It's as if fate is trying to coerce me into learning proper swordsmanship with all the swords I keep collecting.' Quinn thought with amusement.

He then soon received a call from Logan. It hadn't been long, only a few hours, so he was worried something had gone wrong. However, arriving at the lab, he could see that there was good news awaiting him.

Floating in one of the glass tubes, was a person that looked identical to himself.

"Maybe we should give him a different hairstyle or another hair colour so we can differentiate between the two of us? I've always wondered what I would look like with cyan or green hair."

On a closer look he noticed a difference. There was a small marking around the clone's chest, which stuck out slightly. Quinn was sure that underneath was where the Nest Crystal had been placed.

'Amazing, Logan has managed to use the Nest Crystal itself to create a perfect clone. With its unlimited energy it means the clone can live for almost forever!' Vincent explained excitedly.

'Well, I hope you'll like it. After all, it's going to be your body from now on. Let's call Shiro over and do this!'
