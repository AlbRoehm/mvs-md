# Chapter 1760: A Favour.

Quinn had stopped his advance for the first time and stood in front of the colossal giant in front of him. Although they were around fifty metres apart, the shadow cast from Athos had easily reached up to where Quinn was standing.

Quinn looked down on the ground for a split second before looking up at the three in front of him. Even though the person in front of him seemed calm, it would be naive to think he was a friend.

"What do I... say." Quinn thought. "After learning the reaction from the celestials in the strange space, revealing information about where I am from could backfire on me."

"But, I also never saw this Athos in celestial space. What if he doesn't know about what's going on in the team gang?"

"Not everyone will enter that space, and I can tell the celestial energy between these three is far beyond anything I have."

"If the two of us were to fight, I don't know exactly how well I would fare even with all my training in celestial space."

After thinking for a while, Quinn was almost ready to hide the truth, but before opening his mouth, he bit his lip, stopped, and smiled.

"I... have faced so many challenges and did everything for the sake of my galaxy and everyone who lives on Earth, and here I was about to lie about where I come from?"

"I shouldn't be ashamed about my origins... and I shouldn't care what others think.

"I am from the planet called Earth," Quinn said confidently and smiled, looking directly at Athos's face.

Somehow, Quinn expected a reaction. On the other hand, Athos crossed all six arms and stared at Quinn. He didn't say a word, the entire floor was silent.

Geo was still near the hole made by Quinn's attack when entering the floor. The others seemed somewhat now used to the extra gravity, as they could stand independently, but their faces showed clear signs of discomfort.

"I'm surprised that Dober and Nock are quickly adapting to the change. This isn't something they would have been able to do before."

"Is it because the energy of the 50th floor is influencing us? Or is it because of the dire situation, or maybe because we are in front of such great people at the moment?" Geo thought.

"I'm not wrong in thinking that's certainly Athos standing there right now, the god of the Amra race." Dober said.

"The energy inside me almost feels like it's starting to pull towards him."

Hearing this, that was when the other two realised the same. The energy in their body, the one they had gained from entering certain floors in the tower, was pulling towards the man in front of them.

"But who is Quinn?" Nock finally asked. "How can a... what was he called? A human, right?"

"How can a human stand in front of our god that close? And why has our god not said anything after hearing the name of Quinn's planet?"

Unfortunately, none of them had the answer to this question, and all they could do was listen in on this grand event that others wouldn't be able to witness.

"You are very far away from home." Athos finally replied.

"I hear there are also many things happening on Earth at the moment. Tell me why you are here and why you chose to climb the tower."

Although Quinn was relieved that there wasn't an immediate fight on his hands, he still was beaming with his own celestial energy, ready to fight at any moment. For now, though, Quinn thought that honesty would be the best policy.

"I did not come here because I wished to. Rather, someone has forcefully teleported me here."

"I entered the tower because my friend informed me that I could get the parts for a ship here that would allow me to travel back to Earth." Quinn answered.

Once again, there seemed to be a pause while Athos thought about what to say. Although honestly, it made Quinn quite anxious. What was the problem?

"You have caused a mess in my tower and scared the people. This will no doubt affect my planet." Athos replied.

"On top of that, even if I were to give you a ship, it would take you an incredibly long time to return to your planet."

"And since you seem stuck here. I can only assume you don't have the means to use the space to travel back."

"Which makes me wonder, who has even sent you here in the first place? There has to be a reason, and I do not wish to get involved in other people's messes."

"Then don't," Quinn replied. "The person responsible for my current predicament is my problem, and I will deal with it, but it sounds like you have a way of sending me back."

"I apologise about entering the tower, as it was the only way I knew how to get around, and as for my extreme action in the tower, I am in a bit of a rush, you see."

"If you grant me this favour, and help me out, then I will be happy to return this favour and help you out in any of your problems in the future."

Quinn still didn't know what Athos celestial condition was, but learning and listening to the other celestials speak, they always seemed to enjoy making deals with each other, at least one that would benefit them both. So now, learning that creating a ship wasn't the ideal solution, it looked like this man, or the god, in front of him was the only answer.

"So you are asking me for a favour?" Athos placed his hand on his chin.

"Very well, then I have a request you can complete, a favour for a favour. As long as you do what I ask first, then I will happily be able to send you back to Earth."

Hearing this, Quinn furrowed his eyebrow a little, First, although he didn't mind doing this Athos a favour, he didn't know what that would be and second of all, he planned to complete this favour after Athos complied with his.

"I'm sorry, I am happy to comply, but as I said, I am rushing to return to Earth. There is a lot I need to deal with." Quinn answered.

"We can discuss the favour, but only if you could send me to Earth first. Otherwise, I'm afraid we can't agree."

To the others, it seemed strange that one could ask a favour from the god in front of them because Geo was the only one who had heard Quinn's words when the latter claimed to be a god. That was why he wasn't too surprised by all of this and was watching everything in awe.

However, he could tell there had also been a change in the atmosphere after Quinn uttered his words.

"I have already been kind enough to forgive you for disrupting the peace of my tower and killing some of my most talented individuals."

"I think I have proposed a fair deal, and the fact is my favourite is actually related to your home planet anyway. So I believe I am being more than kind."

It took a second for Quinn to decide what to do, and it was then that he lifted his foot and stomped thes shadow that was beneath him. It looked to disperse into pieces before it reformed itself again, creating itself.

It was something that shouldn't have been possible and something the others really didn't understand.

"I will tell you again. I am in quite the rush as well." Quinn raised his fist, opening up and making a tiger claw again.

"I may not have as much celestial energy as you, but I was born a strong fighter. I promise you it will not be easy to take me down."

"I will request again. Please agree with my deal and do me a favour by helping me get back to Earth, otherwise..."

***

# Chapter 1761: The unknown promise.

After Quinn had said those words, the demeanour of the two girls by Athos side began to change. For one, they looked to have pulled a piece of rock from their own body. It had quickly healed, growing back, nearly as quick as the strange beast Quinn had fought against on the tenth floor.

Once their hard golden skin was in their hands, they had crushed the rock and almost started to form it into a spear-like shape. They soon completed this and held two spears in both of their hands. Then brandishing them up in the air, it looked like they were immediately ready to throw them towards Quinn.

"Now, I had heard you were quite the greenhorn when you displayed your energy out in the open. but I never expected you to be so rash," Athos said.

"I don't know what type of god you are."

"Perhaps you were one who has come due to a lot of fighting, that is the case, then I agree you would be troublesome to deal with, but while you are in my tower, I believe you are at a serious disadvantage."

Hearing this, Quinn thought that might be the case. The different floors, the whole tower system, and the strange beasts which would reappear each time, for each floor had to be the Amra god's doing, and it was quite possible that the latter could change the structure of the tower as he wished.

More so than likely, the tower here was somewhat like a celestial item, one that Athos could personally use and do as he wished.

"I also don't want it to come to this, but as I said, I have urgent matters," Quinn asserted.

At that moment, Athos raised two of his arms while the other four remained folded.

"Is he preparing to attack? What should I do? Should I try using my shadow first? Should I try to do my best from the beginning and take him by surprise?”

"This is my first real fight against another real celestial!" Quinn thought.

However, nothing seemed to have happened, the two girls didn't do anything, and no energy was forming in Athos' hands. It was then when Athos crossed his hands again, and Quinn believed that something had to occur, and looking around, he had noticed a key difference.

"What did you do to them!" Quinn shouted as he quickly turned his head. "They have nothing to do with this, and they are the same race as you. They were only helping me!!!"

Geo, Nock, and Dober looked to have all disappeared. Then, in the slight movement that Athos had made, he had changed the floor that the others were standing on to sink them into the ground.

Although Quinn didn't know it, they were in a place where they could view and hear everything that was going on.

"You seemed like a person who would care for them," Athos said.

"It seems you are more inclined to listen to me now. Don't worry, I will not harm them. They are only a security measure to make sure you actually keep to your end of this favour."

"Once you have completed the task, I will send you to earth and release them to do as they wish. They can go with you, live their life in the tower or return to their families."

"How can I even trust what you say?" Quinn replied. "I don't really trust a lot of celestials to begin with, and now you go and do this?"

"I could say the same to you," Athos shrugged, "You have attacked my tower, and this is the first time the two of us have met."

"So how would I know you will keep to your promise? I can see, you think I am the bad guy here, but I am not."

Waving his hand, Athos had created a type of portal that showed the outside city, and it showed the Amra people walking through town with a smile on their faces. Then upon waving his other hand, another portal appeared, and it showed the Amra that lived on the tenth floor, with similarly happy smiles on their faces.

"I know what happened on Earth, so I can understand why you might feel the way you do, but you have to know that things aren't the same here."

"I don't force anyone to try and climb the tower. Everyone can try to enter and clear the floors whenever they wish."

"The people are also free to leave the tower whenever they want if the tower life is not for them. All I have done is given the people a goal something better to look forward to and a purpose in their life."

"I will be upfront with you if you don't trust me. My condition is simple: to create something that will give people a dream."

"The tower is the Amra race's dream. Many living outside wish to enter the tower, while those who live inside wish to reach higher floors."

"The reason why I am being patient is that I want you to see that I am a fair person. Which is why I think this deal can work out for the both of us."

Quinn was still unsure, but he had to admit that what Athos said made sense. He could see that the people he had met and those from Geo's village were actually happy, and the tower guards weren't the ones to abuse their power. What happened between Nock and Geo was more like a personal vendetta than anything.

Of course, some looked down on each other and split the groups into those in the tower and those who lived outside, but was that really Athos doing? Quinn really couldn't say, and if Athos was being truthful about his condition, it wasn't something he was imposing on the Amra.

This meant, just like humans, it was more of something that naturally happened when you had people of various characters.

"I can see that you are at least thinking about this thoroughly. While you are deciding whether to attack me or not, at least let me explain the favour to you." Athos continued. "In this Galaxy, soon in this solar system where the Amra race lives, a Godslayer will arrive."

"I would take care of it myself, but I have other things to deal with and besides, I feel like it's definitely more suited to your role."

"A Godslayer, those were the things that Logan and Bliss talked about, and I also heard many Celestials discuss them in the Celestial space."

"It seemed like there were many of them out in all the different galaxies. Some celestials were even trying to hunt them down."

"Is this a way for him to test my strength?" Looking around, Quinn still couldn't sense where Geo and the others had gone.

In all honesty, he wanted to forget about them. He wanted just to head back home, but there was something inside him, in his nature, that told him he couldn't just abandon Geo, who had helped him.

Even though Quinn felt it was unlikely that Athos would do anything, there was still a small chance, especially after seeing how so many celestials treated the lives on planets as if they were nothing but numbers to fill their condition.

"I promised I would continue to try and live this way to the fullest while I still felt somewhat human. I don't want to be like them."

"Fine," Quinn made up his mind, "I accept your deal, but you better keep every promise you make."

"Otherwise, I swear I will hunt you down and won't give up until you can no longer be reborn."

There was a red glow in Quinn's eyes when he said this, and Athos could tell that he was being sincere. The only thing was, Quinn didn't realise how big of a threat these words were to a celestial, but for the time being, Athos would let it slide as there was a good chance he could kill two birds with one stone.

"Very well, I will now transport you to the planet the Godslayer is on. Good luck."

***

# Chapter 1762: Meeting of two legends.

Just like before, a strange light appeared below Quinn's feet and instantly enveloped him. Only this time, he knew what was going to happen, so he wasn't afraid, and a few seconds later, when the bright light in his vision disappeared, Quinn found himself in a totally new location. Although he had expected this, the teleportation ability did make him quite curious.

However, for now, his attention was more on the place he was teleported to.

"Well, one thing is for sure, I'm not on the same planet anymore." Quinn thought as he looked around.

As far as his eyes could see, he only saw barren ice desert. This place was cold and windy, but he had a few tricks to keep himself warm with the help of blood control. One thing worth mentioning was though, that this place was beautiful in a way and reminded Quinn somewhat of the planet on which he had fought against his first Demon tier beast. He couldn't help but sigh upon remembering that fight.

Then, not letting himself be distracted, he focused more on understanding where he was. He noticed that there were large slices of ice randomly stuck out, they were not small but not big enough to be called mountains either. Rather, they were like bundles of titled needles, stabbed into the ground.

Then at the same time, there were also what looked like trees. Although they too were covered entirely in ice, it was hard to tell from a distance whether they were frozen or if they were purely made of ice and were a natural formation.

"Well, this is definitely not the same planet I was on. So does that mean all the celestials just teleport people as they please? Or did Athos succeed just because I was in his tower?"

"Come to think of it, before Bliss teleported me to the Amra planet, I was in her white space. So I guess this might just be something high-ranked celestials can do?"

"Doesn't this also mean if I was a high ranked celestial, I wouldn't be having all of these problems of trying to get back and I would be able to instantly teleport back to the Earth." Quinn was a little annoyed thinking about it.

If only his condition wasn't so strange, but in the first place, he didn't want to force people into these things anyway. He wanted the others to give blood, in front of his statue, on their own will, without being forced to it.

"Still, I would have liked to know how I would have fared against one of these celestials even though I have a lower amount of celestial energy." Quinn clenched his fist, getting rid of his celestial form and placing back on his usual set of armour with the shadow.

"It's not impossible to take out a celestial without any celestial energy, and these things called god slayers are proof of that."

"They said my power also belonged to a god slayer, so I guess I'm not exactly the normal celestial compared to them."

"Which means most likely these gods will underestimate me a bit just because my energy is lower than theirs. I doubt most of them know about me or my history."

After thinking of this, Quinn decided he should at least start the task at hand. After all, a Godslayer technically needed to be stronger, so this would be no easy fight. On the other hand, the incoming enemy would at least be on Chris's level.

In order to widen his search, Quinn used the tier wings to fly around. Unfortunately, Quinn hadn't been able to practise with these much or improve upon what they could do since in celestial space, items like beast gear didn't work, nor did his shadow powers.

It felt great to use the special demon tier weapons with his shadow, which meant he could block nearly any attack, but after fighting against the Sedi rank, he realised there might be times or ways that attacks could still get through.

"I have been able to increase my celestial and blood powers to a good level, but if this shadow is also some type of God slayer power, then I should be able to keep improving this as well."

"There have to be more ways, more skills on how to use it, but I have always just used it in whatever way the system has given me... and I haven't used shadow overload in a long time either. Not since I lost a large amount of MC points."

Thinking about this, a certain person appeared in his head: Arthur.

Arthur knew a lot about the shadow, and he had developed his own skills with it. So if there was anyone who could train him how to use the powers or at least train with them, it would be Arthur.

"However, Arthur is not here... I wish there was some way I could talk to him."

While continuing to fly around the planet, Quinn honestly didn't really know what he was looking for. He soon saw different beasts fighting against each other and just others living their lives like they usually would, but then there was something that almost made his jaw drop, and it made him second guess if he was on a different planet.

"Is that... another tower!"

Looking at it from afar, it looked similar to the one before but wasn't identical. This one was a bit smaller in length and size and was the same for the city around it.

"I guess I am still in Athos Galaxy. So it seems like he must have set up these towers on every planet."

Getting closer, Quinn retracted his wings as he saw the people outside, and they were indeed what he had guessed; Amra. Their armour and clothing were slightly different but other than that, they were the same in every other way as the people in Geo's village.

Heading up to the gate, Quinn thought his best chance was just walking in and asking them if they had any information about a Godslayer on the planet. However, it seemed like there was no need to, as the Guards walked out and bowed toward him.

"Are you the one named Quinn Talen?" The Tower Guard asked.

"Yes," Quinn replied awkwardly, not sure how to reply. "Were you expecting me... I don't really understand what is going on."

The two guards bowed politely, and after raising their heads, they gestured for him to follow them while saying.

"Our God has told us of your arrival. He stated that someone in your description would be coming to help us. Please follow me towards the tower our commander will explain everything."

Since they didn't seem to be attacking him on sight, Quinn started to go along with them for the time being. Just like they said, they escorted him to the tower and here, a strong force of around fifty or so Amra were waiting.

Quinn recognised the Sedi rank Amra, and there were ten of them in total, but there didn't seem to be anyone higher ranked among the group of people. From what he could hear, they were the highest-ranking people in the tower.

Soon, a Dark Green skinned Amra, who went by the name Peb, started explaining to Quinn as the rest of the troops got ready.

"The Godslayer has been located on our planet. Our lord believes that we might not be enough to apprehend him with our forces."

"Also, we have had reports of many high-level beasts dying on the planet. This opponent seems to be a strong one."

"So we prayed to our Lord to send some support. and it seems like he has answered our prayers."

Quinn didn't know how to take this. He was only speaking with Athos a few moments ago, so how long had Athos planned to use Quinn to try and deal with his problem?

"Well, I'm here now anyway... and I have to do a job if I want to get…"

*BANG!!!

Before Quinn could finish his sentence, everyone heard a loud explosion at the front of the gate from where Quinn had entered not too long ago. Soon after, several screams followed, and there was panic as the people started to rush towards the tower, shouting and calling on the tower guards to help.

"It looks like our little problem has come to us. This should be a quick one then." Quinn smiled and activated his wings flying in the air.

"I'll try and deal with this one as quickly as possible, clear the area if you want everyone to live!"

After shouting those words, Quinn flew straight towards the gate, and he could see sparks off in the distance. They were vicious, large and almost pierced the clouds even though they were coming from the ground.

"That's a lot of power. Is this some type of lighting god slayer? It reminds me a bit of Owen. Well, let's see how they deal with this!" Quinn thought.

Without using his celestial energy, he summoned up bis blood aura, but he had created a large spear his band and threw it as hard as he could straight towards the target below to test the waters.

Using his blood control, Quinn sped it up and followed as quickly as he could behind the attack, planning to follow up.

As for the target, he was in the middle of attacking the Amra that was coming toward him. He would hit them or strike them with lighting, knocking them far away.

From above, the blood spear was coming toward him, and it seemed like the person was too distracted to notice the spear. But when it was just a few inches away, the person turned around and grabbed the spear with his bare hand.

The strength and momentum of the spear pushed his body in the air and set him back a few, but he eventually landed on the ground now the spear was in his hand.

"I can see everything, even your next move," the person shouted, throwing his fist out, and in the next second, it clashed right against Quinn's follow up punch.

"Wait a second... you, you're a human." Quinn said, noticing the person in front of him. He had seen many human-like beings, but not another human being, and here of all places.

"Wait, this God Slayer is a human?"

"Quinn?" The person gaped, equally surprised.

# Chapter 1763: A dark life.

Deep underground in a place where no light shone, there was life. An entire town had been created, with houses, living areas, markets and more. However, what stood out the most in this underground town was a massive tower that almost pierced the top of the ceiling.

One could hear loud grunts echoing throughout the town. The sound of weapons clashing against each other and banging off the armour. The deep and heavy pants of tired people trying to catch their breath.

"Remember, we are in a new age! We are not like the old!" A middle-aged man shouted with his hands behind his back as he overlooked the people training in an open area.

The most notable about these people who had chosen to live underground was their glowing red eyes. This was a vampire settlement, but not the same as it was in the past. They were not above grounds, and no castles, families, or leaders existed.

"Unlike those before us, they believed that the humans would never catch up to us. They believed that they were the superior race and we are but it was due to their passivity that we are in the situation we are in today!" The man shouted.

"This is why we have trained every day, to grow our strength to prove to them that we are the superior race!"

"Whether you wish to control them or turn them into one of us, you must ensure that you are strong enough to live!"

Hearing these words seemed to inspire the vampires, as they used more of their vampire aura to coat their weapons and armour and continued to train with each other, striking harder and faster.

However, it suddenly stopped when the vampires heard the sound of high heels slapping the hard ground. They paused what they were doing and began to line up in a single file, and then at the right time, they all bowed down.

"We welcome you back!" They shouted in unison with their heads bowed down.

Peaking through, they could black boots made of beast skin that spiralled up towards the knee. Then a little bit of skin was shown, revealing a part of her pale thighs, before having more armour covering her groyne area and heading up towards the rest of her body.

Besides her thigh, her skin was only visible from her neck and the gap between the armour on her shoulders and forearms. Her face was stoic, showing almost no emotion, while two dark purple horns were poking out through her short hair.

Then finally, there was the weapon on her back, a longsword, although it was thin compared to the usual two-handed longswords. It was pitch black, and on the hilt was the marking of a single eye with wings.

She was one of the Red Vampire leaders, Layla Munrow.

"It seems you have come back to us in one piece." The man who was training the others was the first to lift his head, but he kept his hands together in a respectful position.

"Yes, I have, but no one else has returned alive," Layla responded. "It's a good thing you are all training because, from the current situation, it's not long before a war breaks out."

Walking ahead, it looked like Layla was heading for the tower, but not too far behind her was another woman who had her hair tied up in a ponytail. Though, she didn't adorn an armour; instead, just a black dress.

She looked fairly old compared to the rest, but she never strayed too far from Layla.

When the two finally entered the tower, Layla let out a big sigh.

"We should rest after what we have been through." The woman said.

"I wish we could, but we must act if we want to get through this. It would be best if you got ready to call all of the Red Vampires back."

"I know it will tire you out, you did your fair share back there as well." Layla smiled.

While walking up the stairs outside, she noticed a shadow casting over the candlelights in the tower. The tower was one of the few places that had light in the entire town. And as the shadow enveloped the candlelights, all of the candles went out as if a blanket of darkness had swallowed them, and a second later, they lit up once again.

"It looks like he has returned," Layla mumbled. Then, without turning around, she spoke to the old woman beside her, "Jil, it would be best if you head back to your room."

Without waiting for a response, Layla put pressure on the step below her front foot and then began to sprint. She ran up the stairs at an incredible speed, eventually reaching a pair of double doors. Pressing her hands, she pushed it open, and here in the large and mostly empty room, she could see a large figure standing there.

"Ah, I see you have returned as well." The voice said as the man turned around, revealing himself to be Laxmus, but he had a giant smile and a dark red crystal in his hand.

"Red heart! You finally got it!" Layla said, walking closer to Laxmus, who soon covered it in shadows, making it disappear. Seeing this made Layla wonder if Laxmus was keeping it safe or trying to keep it away from her.

"That belongs to me just as much as it belongs to you," Layla said, already reaching for the sword on her back. "You have to tell me what you plan to do with it."

Although Layla seemed a bit out of sorts, Laxmus didn't let that spoil his mood.

"It will take some time to learn how to access its power. Originally I was planning to use someone else, but that idea went out of the window." Laxmus replied.

"Either way, both of us are servants of Immortui. So you don't have to worry. When I hand over what Immortui wants using the power of the Red Crystal, I will tell him that we have achieved this together.

"And then finally, rather than just being servants of Immortui, we will also have the power to stand by his side. To do what we wish and even create our own life in this world." Laxmus clenched his fist as if he was crushing something in it, but there was nothing.

"Well, you better act fast," Layla replied. "The Dhampir are advancing, and it looks like they know where this place is."

"I tried my best to slow them down with a task force, but they were too strong this time. It looks like the one they call Queen will be helming the attack herself."

This information seemed to make Laxmus frown, but soon the smile returned.

"I will be ready, and this will be no trouble." After saying these words, a shadow obscured Laxmus's entire body, and he quickly disappeared.

After their short talk, Layla decided to walk out of the tower and head somewhere else. Soon she was found at the edge of the town, where there was almost nothing, no houses or anything and instead just several walls until she finally placed her foot on something on the ground and pushed it down with the right amount of pressure. Next instant, she heard a clicking sound, and part of the wall started to move.

The secret door closed behind Layla, and she continued to walk down the tunnel and could hear the sound of breathing in the distance.

"I thought you would come back with the heart... now you need to explain everything. How did Laxmus manage to get the red heart" Layla had stopped in the middle of her sentence when she saw Xander kneeling beside a certain someone with a large hole in his chest.

Upon seeing the injured man's face, her heart thumped, and her face paled as a fury of emotions appeared on her stoic face - from panic to shock.

"Quinn!"

***

# Chapter 1764: The one and only.

Upon entering the secret room, Layla's eyes widened when she focused on the injured vampire on the ground. Then, without hesitation, she quickly ran forward and kneeled beside the vampire.

Taking a peak, Xander could see that the scales of her horns were changing colour. First, they looked like clouds that were changing to a purple fog, and the next second they looked like they were made of red lava.

Due to her being a vampire sub-class, it was hard to hide her emotions, and ever since getting a permanent set of large horns on her head, it had become more challenging for her, especially in a situation like this.

She placed her hands over the hole on Vincent's chest, and in the next moment, her palms ignited in Green flames. Sweat trickled down her face as she tried to pour as much power as possible to heal the wound.

"How could this happen? After so long, how could this have happened to him? Xander, explain!" Layla shouted, her voice shaking near the end, fear had shouted, gripped her heart with fear, and panic filled her expression. Her breathing was out of control, and the Qi zapping out from her body seemed to be affecting her actions. Even talking was difficult.

"Don't use your life force!" Xander snapped back and placed both hands on her wrist, attempting to lift them off.

"Layla, I mean it. If you do, I will do everything I can to get your hands off his body... and besides, he's not Quinn."

Hearing the last sentence, the intensity of the flames started to dwindle, but she kept them lit up. After recalling the red heart in Laxmus's hands, Layla had a good idea of who was in front of her as she realised who this could be if not Quinn.

"Why...why would he come back at a time like this, after he had been hiding for so long?" Layla asked.

Unsure her powers were doing anything, she continued using her energy, and eventually, the stream of energy healed the wound somewhat. Although vampires have pale skin, there was a unique shade in their skin, and it was beginning to return to Vincent's skin.

"I don't think he's completely gone yet." Layla guessed. "I can only think of one reason why Vincent came back. Is he here? Is Quinn actually back?" She asked.

Shaking his head, Xander turned away. It was hard to see the emotions on his face since Layla could not look directly at him.

"What is this? I thought you said you moved on from him?" Xander finally managed to smile back. "Now, when you see someone who looks like him, all these feelings for him come rushing back?"

Although Layla's face had stayed red, for a second, Xander saw both of her horns turn slightly pink as if she was embarrassed, even though there was a different story in front of him.

"It's not that... you know, my past with Quin is complicated," Layla replied.

"I never lied to you, Xander. But, either way, we must deal with what is in front of us. I don't think Qi or my powers will do anything else for him right now."

"Are you able to place him in your shadow? That will buy us some time."

It was then that Xander pulled out a crystal from his robe. It was quite large, around the size of a water bottle, maybe a little larger, and inside the crystal, there was a dark shadow moving about.

"I don't have much shadow left," Xander explained.

"I can put him in but not for a long time. So if I don't use the shadow powers, then we should be okay, or the other option is to get more shadow," Xander gulped after saying the last sentence. It was the last thing he wanted to do.

"I understand, but I know you brought him here, and it was the right thing to do. You must have thought I would have a plan, and well, I do. But first you need to help me out." Layla replied.

Then without saying another word, Xander used the crystal to use some of his shadow powers. It wrapped Vincent from head to toe, and his body sank into the shadow, going into Xander's very own shadow space.

"Now, tell what happened and how Laxmus got the Red heart, and then we will devise a plan to help Vincent."

Xander explained everything about the grand event and how Laxmuis had somewhat summoned them all without any prior information. Xander was unaware this would happen and found himself in a complicated situation with no initial plans. This was why he wasn't able to do much.

"I'm sorry, I didn't think Laxmus would do that. I thought he would have at least let Vincent live to find how to use the Crystal from him." Xander clenched his fist.

"Don't worry about that. Although I hate to say it, it probably worked out in our favour that he has such a bad temper."

"If Laxmus had decided to capture Vincent, we would have to rescue him before any details of how to use the Red heart leaked."

"Now, somehow, Vincent has managed to buy us some time even in his state. Anyway, we might still be able to stop Laxmus."

"From what you described, Vincent had managed to place the Red heart into his own nest crystal, right?"

"What was actually keeping his body alive before was the Nest Crystal, not the Red heart."

After saying these words, Layla was already standing up, and it looked like she was about to leave.

"What are you planning on doing?" Xander asked.

"From the sounds of it, are you planning to steal this settlement's Nest crystal? We only have one, and we used it for the blood supply. If you get caught, everything we have done will be for nothing."

"Don't forget, there isn't just us that you have to worry about anymore."

Layla stopped for a second, pulled out her black sword from her back, and held it in her hand.

"The Red heart is in Laxmus's hand. We joined to stop this form from happening, and on top of that, there is something else as well."

"I went out to try and stop the dhampirs from advancing. And, it seems like they know about the location of this base."

"And they are not planning a small invasion either, it will be an all-out war. Xander, the dhampirs are too strong."

"I believe Laxmus is underestimating them a lot... especially Erin. I couldn't even properly hurt her."

This had come as quite a surprise to Xander, especially since Layla was one of the strongest people he knew. She was strong enough even to make Laxmus see her as someone he needed and someone on equal ground with her.

"So it doesn't matter. Right now, either Laxmus will find out how to use the Red Heart, or the dhampirs will attack this place."

"So I need to do everything I can before things get out of hand, and the least I can do is bring Vincent back!"

"Tell me something. You said you met Erin?" Xander said. "Did you actually fight her, or did you just try to speak to her."

Layla chuckled when she heard this comment, and Xander didn't know if he was hallucinating, but it looked like a teardrop trickled down Layla's face.

"Both... l don't know why but Erin despises vampires. Maybe it's because it made her become what she is now, I don't know, but I tried fighting her when she wasn't willing to talk."

"In fact, I even used the black sword, but it was all useless."

Hearing this, Xander knew his answer. If the dhampirs attacked, there was little chance they could survive. Moreover, Erin was now a force that was possibly a threat more significant than Graham.

Not saying anything else, Layla left to get the nest crystal. Meanwhile, Xander was left to his thoughts, recalling the fight with Vincent.

"You were right about everything. You knew what Laxmus would do, so does that mean you are right about the other thing as well?"

In the middle of their fight, Vincent had agreed to turn himself in, but he also said a few more words.

"Quinn has returned, I know he has, and although I hate to put all the pressure on the boy, his return means he's needed... find the boy, find Quinn."

"And how am I meant to do that?" Xander said aloud, recollecting those words, "No one knows where he is at the moment."

# Chapter 1765: The Legends Fight.

Two fists had collided on the vast icy planet in such moments that even the ground below them cracked. The Amra onlookers had never witnessed such strength in their lives and were pushed back by the aftershock of the collision. The guards in front of the gate wanted to join in to help Quinn, but they were quickly blown back into the tower walls by the shockwaves, just like everyone else.

Taking a deep look into the eyes of the other. Quinn was trying to figure out who this person could be.

A human that knows my name? And is this far out? I must have known this guy in the past. Quinn thought. It was then that a face had popped up in Quinn's mind. It was one of the enemies that he would never forget, Hilston Blade.

But Hilston Blade was dead. This person couldn't be him. Quickly thinking about it more and recalling Logan's words, Quinn could only come to one conclusion about who the Godslayer was.

"Sil..."

"Shut up!" Sil yelled as he pushed his fist further forward. A power boost suddenly came from behind his elbow as large flames flared out of it. The flames were gigantic, and the heat was heavy, as the ice where they stood instantly melted while the whole area behind him also began to melt as well.

The sudden surge in force had caught Quinn by surprise, and he felt like if he didn't do anything soon, the attack would rip off his entire arm, and for the first time in a long while.

Quinn felt like there was the need to use one of his heavy skills.

Activating the soul weapon Immediately, Quinn gathered all the shadows to his right hand and condensed them. Now his arm up, till his elbow, looked like it wasn't part of his body but it also meant he could take this attack at least.

"This power... it's stronger than the last time I fought against him, but how is that possible? I guess should have expected this."

"Those celestials didn't give him the title of Godslayer for nothing. But I'm not sure how long Shadow Overload will work against him."

After successfully blocking the attack, Quinn quickly leapt back. He had covered his wings in the shadow since he could still use them as if shadow overload was active. The only problem was that while the shadow was in this condensed form to stop attacks, Quinn couldn't really use the shadow overload skill in the way he could in the past.

At least not with these few MC points he had compared to before, and not if he was expecting to block a few more attacks like the first one.

"Sil, it's me, Quinn! Why are you attacking me? We can talk!" Quinn shouted.

"Talk?" Sil asked, placing both hands on the ground. "I've fought against a few of you, and I know these petty tricks. Do you think I will fall for this?"

"Quinn would never be out here, on this planet in the middle of nowhere, and you will pay for using my friend's face like this!"

Quinn suddenly felt a chill on his legs, and upon looking down, he noticed they were beginning to freeze, and the ice wave was slowly coming upwards.

"The melted Ice from before... damn it, he's using his brain." Quinn had to react to one ability after another, and here was where the problem lay: Sil seemed to be stronger than before in terms of his abilities, and there was also the fact that this was the first time Quinn was facing a Sil who had access to every ability he had ever come across.

After freezing the ground, Sil was in the air and had two large whips of lightning in his hands.

They looked at least twenty meters in span as Sil whipped them once on the floor, instantly destroying the icy ground. The heat and the sparks instantly evaporated it, creating a sizzling sound of the steam.

"I've seen this level of power before in the game. If that thing hits me. I don't think my regular body will be able to take it!"

And Quinn knew this would be troublesome since he could only use the condensed shadow to block an attack from one side.

Sil didn't waste any more time and moved his arms back to whip the lightning at Quinn. They hit each other, creating a crackling sound from the sparks, and in the next moment, Sill pulled his arms, sending the whips towards Quinn, one towards each side.

"This damned ice will only slow me down." Quinn used his strength to break through the thickness of it, and to be honest, Sil was quite impressed upon seeing this. That was no ordinary Ice.

"Fine, since you won't listen to me and want to fight, let's fight until you come to your senses!"

Quinn swung his own arms out, and two large long red auras instantly appeared out of his hands and headed towards the incoming lightning whip. Once again, as the two attacks clashed, they stopped mid air, and it looked like they were resonating.

All of this happened in a mere instance. Sil focused all his strength on the lightning whips while a red aura was countering his strength. The shockwaves from this attack were more extensive and even destroyed the walls and the icy ground around them.

[Item type soul weapon has been activated.]

Although Quinn wasn't using his celestial energy because he wasn't fighting against another celestial and didn't want to go all out against his friend, he felt like he had no choice.

Red streaks ran up his arms like blood veins when using the item-type soul weapon because it was linked to Quinn's blood and how it worked.

Swinging his arm down, Quinn couldn't reach Sil with his weapon, but it caused an extensive line of blood aura to slice a cloud above in half. However, the attack had thoroughly missed Sil.

"I'm faster than him... but it's those eyes." Quinn thought.

As for the eyes, he was referring to, it was the ability that allowed one to see ahead of time. Quinn didn't know how far in the future Sil could see with the current strength.

It was then that Sil threw down his lighting whip again, only this time, Quinn threw out his own weapon at the right time, hitting it away, and then charged forward. Quinn started to throw his arms out at a crazy speed, throwing outlines of red aura after aura.

By now, Sil had put his lightning powers away, and he was moving faster than the attacks, although this wasn't exactly correct. Instead, Sil was switching between two abilities, one which allowed him to teleport and the other allowing him to see where the attacks would land.

Using these, he could carefully avoid everything while also getting closer and closer until finally, he leapt, teleporting right in front of Quinn, this time sending a flame kick right at the latter.

[Soul Weapon deactivated.]

[Nitro Accelerate activated.]

Using his still clenched shadow hand, Quinn raised it to block the attack, and at the same time, he threw his fist straight at Sil's stomach, hitting him hard and sending him back into the air until he was out of sight.

"Shit... I forgot Sil was human, and I just threw out an all-out attack with Nitro Accelerate." It just proved how tough of an opponent Sil really was, that Quinn had no choice but to use everything he had.

However, looking in the distance, it looked like there was nothing for him to worry about.

"My body... is not like your typical human." Sil said, taking off his shirt and revealing his muscle-toned body, which was beaming with energy. Quinn could sense straight away that this energy was Qi.

Sil had his right palm facing the sky, and floating above the palm was an open book.

"It looks like I need a set of different abilities to deal with you. You are a tougher one than the previous guy I fought."

He then placed the book away, and suddenly, as Sil walked, two more Sil appeared, and then three became six and so on. In front of Quinn's eyes, Sil was multiplying.

"The great thing about this ability is once I have used it, it doesn't require any more MC cells, and I can use another."

It didn't take long before more than a thousand Sil's appeared off in the distance, now covering all of their arms with strong, powerful flames.

"Ah... Sh*t." Quinn sighed. "This might be harder than fighting Athos."

***

# Chapter 1766: The Legends Fight. (Part 2)

Upon seeing the hundreds of Sil using the flame skill, one didn't need to be a genius to understand that the situation was now much more dangerous.

Sil had made all of his clones using one ability, then switched to another ability. The Clones were still active but no longer taking up his MC cells, and each could use the same set of abilities as Sil. Just one Sil was troublesome enough, a thousand of him would surely give a headache.

"Sil's clones should have the same abilities as when he cloned himself, and only the real Sil should be able to use his soul weapon and switch abilities, but how the hell do I tell which one is the real one?"

There was still time left on the blue fang set before it would require a cooldown, so all he could do was try and finish them off as fast as possible.

Quinn ran toward the crowd of Sil's, and while doing so, he had summoned his own army behind him, it was an army of blood swords. This skill required a lot of blood aura, but Quinn had no choice since there were thousands of opponents on the other side. Although he didn't wish to go all out, he couldn't relax himself either since clearly, Sil hadn't yet recognised him and was after his life for 'impersonating a friend.

Behind them, the Sedi rank Amra had reached the front gate by now, but none of them moved. Not that someone told them to not make a move, rather, they just instinctively knew if they tried to get in the middle of the battle in front of them, they wouldn't even know how they died. In fact, many weren't even sure if they would even survive the shockwaves coming from the clashes.

On the other hand, with his super speed, Quinn reached the group first and threw a fist out filled with aura. The truth was Quinn was running at about 80 percent capacity, and then when getting close to the army of Sil's, he sped up to give an element of surprise.

He had successfully hit the first one head-on, sending him back and through the air, but at the same time, Quinn had felt a heavy flaming kick hit him in the stomach, in the head and more.

"These kicks are strong. I can feel it even though I have Qi covering my entire body!"

"Remember, I know every move you're going to make, and I can sacrifice a few clones to get a hit on you!" Almost all Sil spoke at once.

They went to attack again, some of them with ice and lightning in their hands, but just then, a few tried to retreat but were too slow, as the blood swords rained down on them.

Moments before, a fist hit Quinn straight in the head, he grabbed it with his shadow hand's open palm. Then, clenching it while holding Sil in place, Quinn lifted his leg and kicked Sil directly, knocking him right off and causing the clone's body to disappear.

"Even if you know it's coming, it doesn't mean you can avoid it."

[Shadow Overload has ended]

[You will now suffer from the drawback]

[Blue fang set is now on cooldown]

Usually, seeing these two messages would mean Quinn was at a disadvantage, but that was all in the past. He now had several different ways to fight his enemies, if something hadn't worked so far, he would just need to try another way.

[Item type soul weapon has been activated]

This time instead of getting the twin tails out, Quinn went for the celestial gauntlets. Immediately, ignoring everyone ready to attack him, he punched the ground, creating a mini crater and an earthquake.

Red lines of blood aura began to shine from the cracks in the ice, and in the next second, branches of blood tree's sprouted from them, spreading out and searching for the first target they could see.

Several of the blood branches had pierced the clones, attempting to drain them of their blood, but since there was no blood in them, they ended up disappearing. At the same time, a few of the clones were able to get into a position where the blood branches would not hit them.

"Come on, Sil, you're a Godslayer, aren't you? Well, I am God! So come on, let's see what you got!" Quinn shouted, seeing a large ice pillar being thrown his way.

It cast a shadow over the entire area, and it looked like it would be able to crush anyone just with its sheer size, but Quinn knew there was another person on the other end, someone who would throw it straight at him.

First, Quinn threw out a blood crescent kick to those that were on the ground. He didn't aim to hit any of them but just to hold them back. Then, while spinning his body, Quinn had changed one of his celestial gauntlets into a celestial spear.

At the end of his spin, Quinn had chucked the spear out, and strangely, the strange blades that were stuck in Quinn's body followed the spear. When the celestial blood spear hit the giant ice pillar, it got stuck in one of the ends rather than going right through it.

However, that's where the real part of the spear started to work, as just like the blood branches, it began to spread blood aura through the entire spear, lighting it up red. Eventually, the pillar broke, causing ice to fall below on the other Sil.

While Quinn still had his hand connected to the rest of the spear, he could somewhat retract himself towards it. It was painful as the blades went back into Quinn's body. He could feel it slicing his insides while his body tried to heal it simultaneously, just causing him pure pain, but now he had the spear in his hand and was right in front of Sil.

"I guess you're the real one then!" Quinn said as he transformed the spear into the original twin tail and swung it, hitting Sil and sending him right back down into the ice.

With small cuts on his legs, Quinn had formed his celestial blood armour around his chest and also created a pair of boots for himself. Then hardening the blood from his boots, he could kick off in the air, chasing straight after Sil rather than let gravity do his work.

"I've realised now that something that small won't be able to kill you!"

"You're right." A voice came from behind. Sil had a single green sword in his hand, and swinging it, he struck Quinn, now sending the latter off in the distance. But, while Quinn was in the air, Sil had teleported directly above him again.

"I never thought I would have to start using my weapons on you as well." Syl stated, cutting with his sword, trying to cut Quinn in half.

Meanwhile, Quinn's hands had turned into claws. and swinging them, he caught the blade just before it would strike his head.

Two powerful forces clashed again, and to Quinn's surprise, his tiger fighting style hadn't destroyed the sword.

"Is that a demon tier weapon?" Quinn said, thinking it could only be that. Either way, Quinn pushed the weapon out of the way and attempted to kick Sil, who teleported once again, causing him to miss.

"Sil, I don't want to hurt you, but you are starting to annoy me!" Quinn swung his arm where he predicted Sil would be, and it had somehow worked but had hit a giant shield instead.

"Oh, but I haven't finished with you. You have taken the appearance of a dear friend of mine, and believe me, once you have used everything."

"I will make you feel powerless and show you that you damned gods are nothing!"

Enormous energy blasted from the shield hitting Quinn, but he had both his hands covering his body and containing the energy.

"You idiot. I am the friend you are speaking about. I was locked away for a thousand years, and then that damned woman sent me here!" Quinn shouted back.

"If you really want me to kick your arse like when we first fought, then I can do that!"

Sil suddenly frowned, stopping his shield since the attack seemed to do nothing.

Then, he used his ice powers to create spikes from the ground, attempting to pierce Quinn, but Quinn was avoiding them all and punching the ones that were getting in his way.

"I think you have it all wrong. You never beat me the first time, instead, you ran away, and then the second time, I beat you." Sil was now smiling.

"You beat me? No Way! You tricked me and let Fex get away, which caused us to get involved with the whole vampire settlement!" Quinn shouted, and now the celestial blood armour he had created was starting to cover more and more of his body.

As it did, the pattern it created made Quinn look less like a human. But then, just as Quinn was ready to go up a level in this fight, he noticed something.

Sil was standing there opposite him, smiling, and a tear streaked down his face.

"It's... really... you? I can't believe it!"

***

# Chapter 1767: A different way.

Immediately after noticing the tears on Sil l s face, Quinn placed his celestial energy away. The armour that covered his body began to burst into small little particles, and then covering his body with the shadow, he changed back to his usual armour set.

All this might have been an elaborate trap by Sil, and Quinn might not even really be seeing Sil, but he knew the tears were genuine. How hard it must have been for everyone around him when they felt he might never wake up? He couldn't tell, but for Quinn, it felt like no time had passed, yet all his friends had aged.

This included Sil, who looked more like his father than himself. In the end, Quinn inched forward, giving Sil a big brotherly hug.

"It's okay, Sil... you've worked really hard, haven't you? I can tell you've gotten a lot stronger. Strong enough to kick me about anyway." Quinn smiled, relieved that his friend had finally recognised him.

More tears had come from Sil, and his emotions were currently in a turmoil. He hadn't expressed any type of emotion in a long time, other than anger.

After all, it had been a while since he had been back on earth, talked with his friends and kid, and in his head, Quinn was gone, and they might never meet again. But to his surprise, he met the latter, out here, far away from home.

After Sil had calmed down, he regained his composure, wiping away his tears. It was only now that they were no longer fighting Quinn had the chance to look at the former's strange outfit.

It didn't look like anything someone on earth would wear, and it seemed incredibly light. It was white in colour and almost sparkling if one was to stare at it.

"I got it from a beast I killed in another area, different to this one. It's resistant to nearly anything, and it allows me to use my fire powers without ruining my armour."

"It was beginning to become a problem. I can change into something else if you like." Sil said as he opened up what looked like a portal and pulled out some more standard-looking beast armour.

"So that's where he was getting his weapons during the fight. It must be some kind of other ability." Quinn thought, shaking his head. "It's okay, just wear whatever is comfortable for you."

Looking around, the two noticed that they were far away from the city and couldn't even see the tower. Their fight had taken them away, and they both didn't think anyone would come for them any time soon.

So instead, the two decided to catch up, jumping up on a tall ice sculpture, the largest one there. They reached it easily and sat on the edge, looking out on the plain. This would also give them an idea if someone was coming toward them or not.

Quinn began retelling the story from the moment he woke up from slumber to what he had learnt up to this moment, including the meeting with the Blades, Shiro and his family. He even talked about what Logan had said and how he ended up here.

"That Bliss, she had stayed out of everyone's way for so long and then when you come back, she appears on the scene? I don't think it's a coincidence." Sil said, clenching his fist.

"Here, I thought that having a 1000 years on you, I would have been able to outgrow you."

"Although, I did go easy on you. Just in case it was really you."

Quinn chuckled at this comment.

"That's funny because it was the same for you. I mean, I didn't exactly want to kill you since I knew it was you."

Hearing this, they both laughed, but in their heads, they both had the same thought.

"If that was him going easy, then I don't want to see what he's like at full strength?"

"How did you get so strong? I can understand your Qi getting better, I could feel it when I hit you, and I know about your soul weapon, but it was almost as if your MC cells increased as well." Quinn asked.

There was a limit to one's MC cells unless something extraordinary happened, and there were a couple of cases for this. One was Quinn's shadow which allowed him to gain more MC cells. Sil worked off other MC cells, but this seemed different.

"You were strong as well. Although you didn't use your shadow much, you have all sorts of new tricks up your sleeve. Is it because you lost a lot of it when fighting Graham?" Sil asked.

"You'll understand why I'm asking, and it will answer your question."

It was strange for Quinn to talk to Sil in this way. In the past, the latter hardly said anything and was difficult to communicate with, but now Sil was talking to him just like any other person.

"You're half right. Just now, all my shadow is gone, it's because I used all up fighting against you. I can still use my basic shadow skills but using them as I did before is a complete loss." Quinn was a little saddened because he thought it might be his trump card to fight celestials, and now this has happened.

"Well, to answer your question, there is a way that anyone can increase their MC cells, and while travelling, I found it."

"So I am sure there will be a way to get your Shadow powers back too, and not just that but maybe have them at the same level as when you went up against Graham, if not even stronger." Sil explained.

"It's actually the nest crystals. They have a lot of different uses as it turns out and are quite versatile in how they give energy."

Upon hearing this, Quinn's eyes widened. The nest crystal was what had helped him evolve, he knew the power they had first-hand, so it didn't sound unreasonable to him that they were able to do such things.

The question was, did he have time to find nest crystals? Sil did. He had 1000 years to travel to the other planets, so no wonder he had gotten this strong. But, while thinking about this, another question came to mind.

"Sil, why are you here? I mean, Why are you out here, this place nowhere near the earth, don't you want to go back?" Quinn asked.

Sil's face had changed for the first time since they sat down, and from his expression, Quinn knew the matter was serious.

"You know the gist of it from Logan, but I guess he probably didn't tell you everything because he didn't want you to worry about me."

"Maybe I shouldn't have done it, but honestly, Quinn, I did it because I wanted to know about you. One of the abilities I obtained allowed me to look into the future."

"Maybe I shouldn't have done it, but combining my strongest MC cells, I wanted to see if you would come back."

"Looking into the future, I instead saw that the Earth was being attacked again, but it wasn't the Dalki army or anything like that. Rather, it was just a few creatures, people that I had never seen before."

"When I told Logan about this, he explained that what I saw was most likely gods or celestials coming to attack Earth."

"After you had done so much to protect the planet, I couldn't let that happen, but I didn't know when they were coming, and I was afraid to look again into the future."

"Seeing the future is a strange thing because you don't know what actions will lead to the one you have seen, so I tried to avoid it as much as possible. Still, I vividly remembered every one of the celestial's faces and I decided to go looking for them."

"The Blades were okay, and everyone seemed to be fine without me. Sure there were problems, but Logan felt like this might become an even bigger problem."

"Which is why I went out to get stronger and search for these gods. Honestly, I have no clue where I am now... and I kinda don't know how to get back." Sil smiled.

It was a lonely tale, and Quinn wondered how Sil could do it on his own without anyone by the latter's side. If it was him, he probably would have gone mad, but Sil always had a strange upbringing in the first place... and now he didn't have to do it alone.

"And here I thought you were my ticket out of here." Quinn sighed.

"About that," Sil said, opening a portal and pulling out a strange small device with a single screen.

"I'm a bit worried, Quinn. The whole time I have been out here, not once have any of the others tried to contact me, but the other day I was asked to return and help."

"The problem is I don't know how old that message is. As Logan told me before I left, there would be delays from when the message would reach me depending on how far we are."

Hearing this, Quinn clenched his fists.

"I was right. We need to rush, and we only have one choice on how to get back quickly. We must meet Athos."

***

# Chapter 1768: Two is better than one.

Today, the celestial space was a bit livelier than usual. With new celestials appearing, more talks of celestials working together and also, the celestial named BB staying in the space for so long, it was clear it was not the space it used to be, and today too, something strange had occurred.

With a lack of new celestials, Xox was floating about, looking for people he could work with. Honestly, he tried his best to avoid a particular area due to what happened last time and didn't travel too far from his own spot either. That's when something caught his eye.

"What is going on over there? Has someone created a separate space in the space... that's strange." Xox slightly frowned as he started to float over.

He could see that around eight celestials were already in the new space and had gathered around a ball of energy. It was strange to see a new space in the current space because the celestial space created for all celestials was most effective on the flow of time.

The flow of time here was practically non-existent as compared to the universe. And although Celestials could create their own spaces that had a similar effect, something of this degree was impossible. Also, if anyone created a space inside the Celestial Space, it would have an opposite effect. It would increase the time flow, and might even bring it close to the universal time flow speed.

Xox being a nosy celestial, decided to enter anyway. He felt unusual and refreshing as soon as he stepped inside, and now he was on the other side of the translucent glass. He could still see others on the other side, but they were moving a lot faster, too fast for Xox to keep track of what was happening.

"This space sucks. Time is hardly slow here, if not at all!" Xox shook his head.

Despite entering the space though, Xox could see that the eyes of the other were still glued to the white energy. So, floating along, he finally decided to take a look for himself at what was going on.

"What... is that? What are you guys watching?" Xox asked.

"Zinker here has been following this Godslayer for a while, ever since that guy caused trouble on one of his planets."

"And after learning he had defeated a couple of Celestial already, he continued to watch, waiting for the right opportunity, and it looks like he's fighting against someone right now." One of the celestials explained.

Now Xox understood the reason for the space. When looking at planets through the white balls of energy, due to the space they were in, the lives, actions, and things that occurred on the planet were non-existent.

This was a safe way to see the events of the planet first-hand while also not being directly on the plant itself. Moreover, it was a common tool that celestials of their own galaxy would use, not usually bystanders or others.

"The celestial he is fighting against seems to be quite strong. Does anyone here know who he is?" Xox asked, but the rest just shrugged their shoulders.

After all, all they could see in the celestial space were balls of energy, and there were many that were shaped like the human in front of them. As the fight went on, some began to cheer for the celestial, especially Zinker, who bore a grudge.

"Now I understand why you didn't try to stop him. He would have killed you in an instant!" One said to Zinker.

That was when the fight started to heat up, it came to a disappointing end, they both laid down their weapons, and now, most importantly, they hugged each other and now chatted, sitting on top of the mountain. The others were confused as they looked at each other.

"Don't tell me this Celestial knows the Godslayer? Has this ever happened before?" Xox asked.

"Thinking about it, I have heard of cases like this, but usually it only occurs if the celestial is not a born one, and to still know someone, they would have to be quite a young celestial." The other explained.

Hearing this, it was then that a light bulb moment ensued to Xox. "Do you know what planet the Godslayer is from?"

"Yes, he's one of the troublemakers from Earth," Zinker replied.

The celestial ball, Xox, started to bounce up and down as a shiver ran through his body.

"That's 13B, it has to be. I never knew he was that strong. Didn't he just enter the space? How is he that powerful... and he's with the troublemaker God Slayer?"

"Does he know all of the Godslayers... this is not good... this is not good at all. If others find out about this... what will happen to the Milky way Galaxy?"

Both Quinn and Sil were now walking back towards the way they came. They would have loved to have talked about some of the olden days, but it seemed more significant matters were at hand.

"I have a ship that we can use, and I placed it in my dimensional space, so it is safe unless something happens to me, but as I said, I never really knew where I was going and was just hopping from planet to planet," Sil explained.

"And did you manage to kill a few gods during that time?" Quinn asked.

"I'm not sure," Sil replied. "So far, I haven't come across anyone who called himself a Celestial. Also, in the beginning, I stayed close to the planets near ours and slowly moved out."

"When I landed on their planets though, they would just send people after me to attack me."

"It was the same on this planet as well. I'm not sure who the God here is. Oh yeah, I do recall two opponents who gave me a really tough fight, maybe you're talking about them?" Sil replied.

The two had different experiences, and this was perhaps the title that they both had. Still, Quinn was amazed by what Sil had achieved but wondered just how far he had come from Earth. After chatting for a while, the topic of how to return to the Earth came up.

"We could just fly from planet to planet and try to find the one I came from, but that could take a long time. Instead, I think it will be better if we get Athos' attention and ask him to send us back." Quinn explained.

"And how do you plan to do that?" Sil asked.

Just then, Quinn pointed at a large object in the distance.

*** *** ***

"What is going on!" People from below shouted as they looked at the tower, the tower they had admired for so long. It had several holes inside it, and most of it was enveloped in flames.

It was clear that it was no longer the great building they once worshipped, and at the very top were two individuals responsible for the whole incident standing in a single room.

It was bright, and the floor looked almost like they were walking on water while there was a clear sky above.

"With the two of us working together, it went quicker than I expected," Quinn said.

"It would have been quicker if you let me kill those inside the tower. These guys tried to kill us, so I don't know why you are letting them off," Sil complained.

"It's because they are just doing their job, and remember, we are the attackers in this situation. We don't need to kill others to get his attention but taking down his towers is another thing altogether."

In this tower, there were only fifty floors compared to the hundred on the previous one.

And as they got higher into the floors, Quinn sensed an energy. He didn't know what it was, but he realised it was part celestial energy mixed with something else that was a little familiar.

"It's right here! This is the source of the tower!" After a thought, Quinn punched down the waterlike flooring, and as it shattered, he could finally see the familiar thing as he picked it up and held it in his hand.

"Will you look at that, a Nest Crystal!" Sil smiled. "Maybe we can kill two birds with one stone with this method."

# Chapter 1769: The strange Nest Crystal.

Holding the nest crystal in his hand, Quinn observed it for a moment before attempting to do anything with it because he realised that the crystal didn't just have the usual beast energy like he was used to. Instead, he could also feel celestial energy in it as well.

"I thought it was coming from the tower, but it looks like the tower is linked to the Nest crystal. It also reminds me of how the Vampire castles were linked to each of the leaders as well."

"I remember that most of that was done through magic discovered mostly by Richard Eno."

"Come to think of it, this celestial stuff is more linked to magic, and that was how the vampires and Eno were summoned in the first place." Quinn thought.

That's when Quinn noticed that there was a marking on it, the same marking he had seen on the two that stood by Athos side that time.

"This is a celestial marking. Is this how he was able to combine the energy of the nest crystal with his own powers?"

"These crystals are quite strange, but it makes sense how the tower was able to be powered, creating the space, and making something like this."

"It's just a giant celestial weapon created with a nest crystal."

"Hey man, I thought we were in a bit of a rush?" Sil said, sitting on the floor and rocking back and forth. It was something that had become a habit of his when he was bored or thinking.

"Sorry, I was just trying to figure out how to use this to increase my MC cells," Quinn replied.

Just as Quinn said that, as if the system had heard his wish, it popped up with a notification screen.

[A nest crystal has been discovered]

[The system has detected that the user has requested to increase one's MC cells.]

[The system has detected that there is Celestial energy embedded into the crystal]

[Celestial points can be absorbed from the crystal, would you like to do this first?]

"Haha, what is this? Is the system actually being helpful for a change?"

"You haven't come up much these days, but I think I prefer you to the olden days where you threatened to kill me if I didn't drink blood in time."

Either way, Quinn decided to accept the system's request as it was a nice surprise because so far, he thought he could only get celestial points for defeating dedicated followers or from his quests, so it was nice to learn he could do it this way.

"I wonder, if I held celestial weapons in my hand, if I could do this as well."

Immediately after accepting, Quinn felt a surge of energy enter through his hands and start to spread straight through his body. Unlike his Qi which centred around his body, the celestial energy was almost hidden in cells all over, which was why, when activated, it spread through his veins and more.

It didn't take long, and the notification screen was a nice surprise.

[28546/41256/ Celestial energy].

"That was around 10,000 Celestial Points. Is that how much Athos used to create this tower?" Quinn started to think.

"The other tower was a lot larger, and the floors seemed to be more detailed. On top of that, how many towers does Athos even own?"

"This all means one thing, Athos has a lot of celestial points to play with, at least a lot more than me."

Gathering information was Quinn's preparation for what might come because it could be the first time he would go up against another celestial, and honestly, he was happy that he would have a strong ally by his side to back him up for this one.

[Would you like to absorb the next crystal to increase your MC points?]

This was the next step to increasing Quinn's power. To develop his apparent God slayer ability, he needed the MC points to match or go up against them before that.

Quinn was a little worried that the process would take a long time, after all, it had done the last two times. When evolving and when heading into his slumber to wake up again, but this time, the energy was easily absorbed into his body.

He could feel it rushing into him naturally, and there was next to no strain on his body absorbing the crystal.

[20,435 MC points have been gained]

Quinn had to blink twice to make sure he had been reading the right number.

"This number is huge, it's not as much as when Arthur gave me his, but he had been using the Shadow eater skill on others for years."

"A single next crystal was able to do this much. After absorbing five, I would have been back to the way I was."

"I wonder if Arthur knew about this, he could have increased his strength, or maybe I and Sil are only able to do this because of our special bodies."

It was a hard one to guess, but either way, he now had a new way of increasing his shadow powers back to what they were, maybe even improving them. It was only then that Quinn was starting to understand that if Sil was doing this for 1000 years, he could do more than enough with his abilities, and perhaps he really didn't show everything he had.

"It's good, right, the feeling of absorbing a nest crystal is quite addictive. I figured it out when I saw some of the demon-tier beasts going after them. I thought there had to be a reason."

"Honestly, usually, there are multiple nest crystals on each planet, but you don't want to mess up their ecosystem so much by taking too much."

"However, they're hard to find and usually heavily Guarded. Even with my powers, there are nest crystals that are not worth it due to the beasts around them or just how much trouble it would be to get them."

It was then that Quinn could feel the tower shaking, and a sinking feeling in their stomach could be felt as if the tower was starting to fall and crumble, and Quinn had a good idea why this was happening.

"There's an easy way to find these crystals, and it was what we were planning to do anyway," Quinn replied. "I bet in every one of these towers, there is a nest crystal, so let's get going."

Using Sil's special powers, a ship was summoned, and the two were off. They didn't really know where they were going but decided just to head to one of the closest planets. Once they reached the planet, they would fly around until they saw a living place, then there was always something else they would spot as well, another tower.

"It looks like he really does have a tower on every one of these planets. I know we're in a rush, but this is killing two birds with one stone away."

"It will help me prepare for whatever I have to go up against when I get back." Quinn thought.

Just like last time, after landing and making a grand entrance, Quinn and Sil were able to enter the tower with ease and blast their way through the floors. Each tower was slightly different in the number of floors they had, but this one also had a nest Crystal at the very top.

"It's getting easier because I can now use my shadow powers as well to help out. With the next tower, I'm going to have to start experimenting a little bit if that's okay with you." Quinn asked.

"I've got your back in all types of situations. I just hope your plan works," Sil replied.

*** *** ***

At that moment, Athos was getting reports and watching this all from his seat on the 100tth floor.

"There is destroying all of my towers, and they are doing it with ease. All the hard work I built up over the years has just disappeared like that."

"I'm surprised you chose this option, but you have left me with no choice."
