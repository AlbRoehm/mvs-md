# Chapter 1780: Five Choices.

With the location of the Red Vampire base revealed to them by Logan, the group was off, and it wasn't strange to say that it was a bit of an awkward ride for this unexpected group. They had taken a spaceship that wasn't utilised to fly at the fastest speeds since it was more for use on Earth than in outer space.

But the main reason Logan chose this spaceship for the group was that it created the least noise, so it was best for the group in this situation since they wanted to approach the destination in stealth. And honestly, stealth wasn't the group's best trait. Also, during the ride, there wasn't much conversation between everyone. That was because they all hardly knew each other.

"Man, I don't think I've ever been in a room before with so many people, and it was this quiet," Jake said aloud at the Ship's helm. It was on autopilot anyway, so there wasn't much for him to do, but just in case, he was ready.

"Everyone is so quiet," Minny said, drinking a juice box. Ever since Quinn had gone, er so-called three aunties, Jessica, Lucia and Hannah, were spoiling her. The only one who would say no to her was Muka, which made Minny think twice about becoming her new mother.

"Is it because dad isn't here?" Minny wondered.

Although they didn't want to admit it, that was most likely the case. Everyone in the room was related to Quinn, but they didn't know each other well. Only Lucia and Jessica got on better than most because they had already travelled alongside each other for a long time.

Meanwhile, Peter was as antisocial as always, Jake was a loud mouth, and Mitchell took every opportunity to sleep and was even sleeping now.

"Dad? Who's your dad?" Jake asked.

"Dad... dad's name is Quinn. He went missing after... after." Minny started to sniffle, and from the sound of it, it seemed like she would burst into tears any second now.

"Wow, so your dad's the strong Quinn, huh? No wonder you're so strong as well." Jake quickly said, trying to change the subject.

"I never knew Quinn had a child though. We didn't learn about that, and Dad didn't say anything. So who's your mum then?"

After asking this question, James could feel heat coming from the back of his head. He could sense the three ladies giving him a death stare, burning a hole into the back of his head. At this moment, Mitchell had woken up as well and was also a little annoyed because if Minny started to cry, it would disturb his precious sleep.

Although surprisingly, Minny didn't cry and instead had her finger on her chin. She looked at the four girls who happened to be standing next to each other.

"Wait a second, is she doing what I think she's doing?!" Jessica thought.

"She's trying to decide who to pick as her mother? I thought she'd start crying because of her real dead mother, but it looks like she's looking at one of us as her replacement?"

"I thought she would have said Muka straight away but I saw how strict Muka has been with her, which is why I have secretly been sneaking her juice boxes whenever I can. So it looks like my hard work has paid off."

“If Minna likes me like a mother. Naturally, I will be spending more time with Quinn. If so, who knows what might happen.”

"After so many years, we could be... be... husband and wife!"

The thought had made her cheeks turn cherry red, but unknown to her, she wasn't the only one with a red face either. Whether the other two were thinking the same thing or not was hard to tell.

Opening one eye and glancing at the situation, Mitchell was just thankful that Miny wasn't crying and closed both of his eyes to take a nap in his seat.

"Quinn, you will certainly have your hands full with this many women around you. Maybe I should suggest to Master Quinn to allow me to give him a hand if he has too much trouble." Mitchell was smiling to himsellf.

"Minny can't decide. The little vampire said, "For now, Minny has no favourites. Everyone has done well."

Turning around, Minny prevented the others from seeing her smile.

"What a bunch of weirdos," Jake thought. "I just asked some normal questions, and this is what happens."

"I think the quietness was better, Great Hero Quinn, you came back after millennia, and these are the ones you chose to be with? Then again, my father isn't exactly a normal person either."

While thinking of his father, the Ship received a call, promptly attracting his attention. And when he clicked on receive, his father appeared on the screen.

"I have some important information to give you all. From my radar, it looks like you aren't too far away from the location of the Red Vampire base."

"Using satellite imagery, I have been keeping track of the site and around it, and it looks like the Dhampirs are already heading towards it. They will reach the location before you."

"Anyway, the more important thing is that you need to make a stop and pick up a few people before you reach the Red Vampire's base." The message ended there before the others could react, much less ask any questions.

"The dhampirs are attacking the red base?! It looks like the information Andy shared was true." Hannah said, not knowing how to feel. The Red Vampire base was her home.

The location often changed, so it wasn't home like in the usual sense, but the people and the community were what made it home to her. The other girls could see this, with Lucia looking at her.

"It's going to be okay... we're heading there to help." She said.

"Are we?" Peter interrupted.

"Sorry to burst your bubble, but we are going there to give the Red Vampires payback. Don't forget what they did to Vincent, and they're the ones with the Red heart at the moment."

"Yes, the dhampirs want to kill vampires, so they are our enemy as well, but right now, getting the Red heart is more important, no?"

"So isn't it a good thing that the dhampirs are attacking? But if the dhampirs get the red heart, what are they planning to use it for?"

Silence struck the group. Lucia just said words of comfort and wasn't really thinking about that.

"What Peter says is right," Muka stated. "The strength between the two sides might be equal."

"On the other hand, one side might also completely overwhelm the other, but we must pick a side in this fight because fighting against both sides wouldn't be wise, nor would it end well for us."

Jake was going to follow the others, but he would also follow his father's orders the most. He was to hide his face and conceal his involvement in this incident. Because if the dhampirs found him, there was a good chance they would convey it to Pure, which could be a disaster for Logan Green.

It was too early to tell though, because even Peter was unsure. After all, one thing was for sure. if Layla really was on the other side, someone working for Laxmus, and Peter had to deal with her, then he couldn't imagine telling Quinn of those details. No, it was impossible. It just wasn't an option.

The Ship took a slight detour from their destination and entered quite a mountainous area. Eventually, it found a section where the ground was somewhat flat. However, it was surrounded by three large mountains that covered the place.

"Ah, I can see them up ahead!" Jake suddenly said, attracting everyone's attention.

The Ship landed, and the rail descended, allowing the newcomers to get on board. Soon the group could hear people entering the Ship and coming through the doors individually.

"Oh, this is the backup Logan Green was talking about, right?" Lucia said.

"I doubt anyone they send will be of much use though." Jake commented, his arms folded.

But when the door slid open, Peter's mouth was left wide open as a face he never thought he would see again appeared in front of his eyes.

"Bo… Borden?"

***

# Chapter 1781: First True Dalki.

Although the man who stepped into the spaceship certainly looked, the group was more surprised by Peter's reaction. A man who didn't seem to care about anything or anyone apart from Quinn, and lately one other, was slowly walking towards this person as if they had seen a ghost.

"Does Peter know this person? Is it another of his old friends from that Cursed Faction we learned about?" Lucia thought.

On a closer inspection, though, she noticed a few markings on the man's face. It looked almost like scales were running up his sideburns, and there were a few scales close to his hairline.

Everything else about the person looked quite human, so it didn't seem like too big of a deal.

"I don't understand, Borden. How are you still alive after all this time?" Peter finally regained his composure and asked.

"Hey, everyone is interested in him, and there's no welcome for me?" Shiro smiled as he walked in. However, he did get a big hug from Jake, who welcomed his uncle.

The others also gave Shiro a respectful bow, knowing who he was in the Blade family. His presence gave everyone in the spaceship a bit more confidence that this mission would go well.

Still, it didn't seem like this would be enough to take on Laxmus or anyone of his calibre based on what they had gone through unless this other person was also quite special.

"It's good to see you as well. It's a shame that Quinn isn't here to enjoy this moment either." Borden replied with a smile.

Peter and Borden had a unique relationship. Borden was one of the people who had helped them when they went onto Blade Island. On top of that, Borden was close with the Blade kids, and so was Peter, as the two of them were the primary teachers back then.

Even if they only really taught them combat lessons.

"Quinn will be happy to see you. He probably thought the same as me, that you would be dead by now. And, if I remember correctly, didn't the Dalki's have a short lifespan?" Peter asked.

After hearing these words, as if an instinct had taken over everyone else, they took a step back.

Now thinking about it, the scale looked familiar on his body, and there were more on his arms as well.

Being brought up and told how vicious the Dalki race was and how much of a threat they were to the human race, it was normal for everyone to act this way, but seeing everyone's reaction, Borden just let out a chuckle.

"Way to go and reveal my big secret to everyone." Borden chuckled. "You just couldn't wait for me to explain myself first?"

After letting out a fake sigh, Borden went to sit on one of the seats and lifted his hands to show that he was friendly.

"Don't worry, I am a Blade, and I'm not exactly a full Dalki anyway, so none of you needs to be wary. But, regardless, I will just tell you a bit about myself to ease your worries."

"But honestly, my situation is quite complicated, and I don't even know the exact reason as there are a lot of different factors that… let's say, led to this."

"I don't know if you all are aware, but a group of Dalki had surrendered during the time of war. They continued to live with humans, and Logan supported them for a while."

"But, of course, Logan being Logan, he had done so with an intention. So he set up a condition that if they could help him with research, he would be happy to help."

"Just like you said, after another 25 years or so, all of the Dalki on that planet had died. During that time, Logan discovered that I was different from the other Dalki."

"Unlike them, I primarily have a human form and only change into a Dalki when I'm enraged. When creating me, Logan said he more so created a clone of Vorden rather than another race like the Dalki."

"So I was quite stable. He also had managed to get some of the demon tier beast's full energy from the lab when we fought against the Dragon."

"Anyway, Logan told me one thing. I was to stop transforming into the Dalki version if I wanted to live."

"At least normal life span, a human's that is. Anyway, I listened to Logan and continued to live my life, but with everything happening, I also wanted to help my friends."

"So I never stopped searching for a way to... let's say fix myself."

A lot of the thoughts were going through others heads. Even though they were missing a lot of the context, the more they learned about Quinn's life and those around him, the more fascinated they became. It was as if all these small encounters of Quinn with these people, everything they had done together, was what had allowed them to defeat the Dalki.

Without the help and how the events happened, perhaps the Dalki would be ruling everyone at this moment.

"Surprisingly, it was Vorden and Raten's humanoid beasts that managed to help me. They told me I was not human and should stop thinking like one. They had a theory that my beast part was incomplete."

"After all, beasts live for thousands of years. The older they are, the stronger they get. Their solution was to try to become more of a beast, and they recommended that I consume beast crystals."

"As you know, beasts can evolve by eating the crystals of other beasts. For humans, the energy is too raw and would kill them."

"Unless one absorbs it in a particular way like Quinn did, and even then, the human bodies wouldn't be able to handle such a thing thoroughly, but a beast body could and my body wasn't human."

"It took a long time, a very long time, I consumed crystal after crystal, and the years went past."

"It was painfully slow, and I could imagine that the Dalki could not use this method, for their lifespan was too small, to begin with, but because I had those few extra years, I could take the risk."

"At the same time, they also had the problem of being unable to reproduce."

"Anyway, after a thousand years, here I am," Borden said, standing up. "You're looking at the most likely first complete Dalki."

Saying these words, Borden was expecting something, but everyone on the ship was awkwardly silent. They didn't understand the meaning behind the achievement that Borden was being proud of.

"Well, that was a nice story from Uncle Borden, and it successfully kept things interesting while we got to our destination," Jake said and then, smiling at Borden, he added.

"Uncle, I look forward to seeing what type of power you have as a complete Dalki. Hopefully, we can put you to the test soon."

"Is the base here?" Lucia asked, looking out of the window, only to see mountains and valleys.

"It's not far from here." Jack replied. "We will park the ship here and get to the base on foot."

After a few minutes, the group descended from the ship, leaving it on the mountain top and activating a special camouflage feature to obscure the ship. It made the ship blend in with the background, but if someone came too close, they could tell that something was strange at the scene and might even be able to find the ship.

As for why they had been made to stop here, it was made quite clear after following Jake. They travelled across another mountain top at quite a speed but as silently as possible. When they reached the peak, they could see a valley.

In the valley, they saw a lot of individuals gathered outside of a massive hole in one of the mountains.

"Those are Dhampirs, and it says the red vampire base is located over there," Jake explained while looking at the tracker in his hand.

Then, raising his head, he asked everyone, "So, any ideas on what we should do? How do we get to Xander?"

"Well, let's just push through, get rid of the Dhampirs and enter the Red Vampire's base. We can deal with things as they come." Peter laid out his straightforward idea.

"Now that's what you call a plan." Borden nodded, agreeing.

"You guys are complete idiots. Is there anyone with an actual plan? If we can, I think it would be best if we avoid fighting the dhampirs and enter through a different location."

"They're just going to waste our time otherwise." Jake replied, looking at everyone in front of him.

"If you want to know our luckiest way of entering, it would be that mountain top right there," Muka said, pointing at the mountain at whose base the dhampirs had created the hole.

"Luck?" Jake frowned, shaking his head.

Soon, the whole group found themselves sneaking past the dhampirs and were now on top of the mountain. Surprisingly, the peak of the mountain had quite a flat surface.

"There's no need to go any further than this!" Jake shouted. "It says they're right below us, but how do we get in?"

Without saying anything, Peter raised his fist and soon started covering it with the yellow aura. Jake was slow to react because he couldn't quite believe what Peter was doing, but by then, it was too late.

# Chapter 1782: One last attack!

While using the Black Celestial Sword, which had turned into a bow, Layla needed to concentrate to not lose control of herself. Even more so now that she had just pulled out a Qi arrow, although it wasn't just any Qi arrow, it was one created from her life force.

For a long time, Layla had been holding the Qi of two people inside her, her own and her mother's, which she had received when the latter died. This allowed Layla to have a lot of Qi in her body, much more compared to the others.

Originally, Layla thought she would amount to nothing and had only gotten stronger due to two things. One, the Hannya form which Quinn had turned her into and the second was due to her mother's Qi.

Even now, she was using the celestial energy from the sword. However, Layla had been practising with her Qi endlessly during the years she had been with the red vampires. She not only tried to improve her sword skills, her Hannya powers and more, but also her Qi capacity.

Over time she realised that she could gather huge amounts of Qi. Just like her mother. The apple didn't fall too far from the tree. Layla was able to train this Qi and let it expand more and more inside her body, which was why she was able to go almost toe-to-toe against Laxmus. Not just because of the other factors.

She even used her Qi to disrupt Laxmus's shadow, which seemed a level above and more powerful than Quinn's shadow. Either way, even though she had a large amount of Qi, she was using everything in one attack to cause as much damage as possible. However, this life-force arrow attack would permanently remove Qi from her body.

Although it was not all of her Qi, it would take years until she could build it up to the current level once again. When she was ready to pull the bow and release the arrow though, she heard a resounding explosion.

"That power, No doubt it has to be Erin!" Layla thought.

Taking her eye off the battle for a second, as she turned back, she could see that Laxmus was already breaking out of the chains. A few links had been broken, and she could sense a large, powerful force trying to break free.

She didn't have the time to send more black spots toward Laxmus or his hands. Without hesitation, she let go of the arrow. Then using her powers, she pulled the arrow as fast as possible and pushed it forward.

At the very last moment, Layla saw the man break free but was forced to look away. As the arrow made contact, the whole area lit up with bright white light. It expanded like a ball, but as it touched the buildings and the wall next to it, it did not harm them.

As for Laxmus, it was a different story altogether. Where he once was, a large hole went deep into the ground, far too deep for Layla to see Laxmus.

Layla's was drained after she released the arrow, and slowly she glided down as she didn't have enough power to let herself fly properly.

I'm afraid we have lost this one. The Sword said. We did all we could. I know you can still push yourself further and continue to use me, but it's pointless. I wish you to at least enjoy your final moments with some peace.

The black colour running through Layla's veins and from her eyes started to disappear. Her bow changed back into a sword as Layla finally landed on the floor, next to the large hole she had made.

The screams in her head had stopped as soon as the Sword stopped giving her Celestial power. As the Sword said, it was a peaceful moment, but only for her. Not far from her, she could still hear the screams and the sound of weapons clashing.

While she was staring at the hole, a black hand suddenly appeared at the edge, and as if a monster was crawling out of a pit of hell, Laxmus crunched the ground and pulled himself up.

His right hand had a hole as big as a golf ball, and there was another close to the elbow. He had most likely tried to defend himself from the arrow, but it went through his hand.

"Well, it has been a long time since I have bled. Now I can see why you deserve that weapon." Laxmus said as his blood dripped from the tip of his finger to the ground.

Strangely, as soon as the drop touched the rocky surface, it started to fizzle as if the blood was acidic.

"I don't know what you did, but I cannot heal, and because of that, I will make sure you can never heal either!"

Laxmus ran forward towards Layla. Although the Sword told her to give up, she just couldn't give up as certain images appeared in her head. She desperately pulled the Sword in front of her stomach, above the spot Laxmus was planning to hit.

As it landed, Layla's body flew up in the air from the force, the Sword was intact, but the strength of the punch almost went through the Sword as she could feel a pain in her whole body.

"It's been so long... it's been so long...I had even forgotten what he looked like."

"Can you even imagine how long one thousand years is... how much time... how many good memories of mine... of him has faded... and when I saw his look a like... how much hope that would bring."

Now heavily injured, she slowly raised her head and could see Laxmus with his fist ready to punch her in the stomach again. However, she still didn't give up, and rather than block the attack, Layla swung her Sword right at Laxmus's fist this time.

However, unlike before, she was no match for power. Instead, she was instantly sent flying and slammed far off into the ground near the lab. The blow was powerful as the shockwave created by Layla hitting the ground had destroyed several of the houses near the Lab.

Layla coughed off an almighty amount of blood from her mouth.

"I have to focus, use the internal flames in my body to heal my wounds... use the Qi to focus on the cells to repair themselves."

"Damn it hurts... even though I used all the remaining Qi to defend, he was able to do this much damage." Layla thought.

She soon felt the ground shake as Laxmus landed in front of her and retracted his wings into his body.

"I thought Immortui would have trusted someone a lot stronger with his Sword. I gave you compliments early because I thought I would see more."

"But, instead, you suddenly became so weak. Are you really a servant of him? Was this really a test?" Laxmus asked.

Layla stared at him. She knew she could only count on one thing.

"We shouldn't be fighting right now!" Layla said as more blood dripped out of her mouth. "We have more problems we need to deal with right now!"

"You're right. I need to get my nest-crystal back and then use the red heart, but for now, I shall deal with you." Laxmus opened his mouth, and the red energy beam began to accumulate.

Laxmus's Blood Breath was one of his strongest attacks, and without the Celestial Sword's power, Layla had no way of stopping it.

Holding the Sword, Layla stabbed it into the ground and managed to pull herself upright. It would still take some time for her wounds to heal, and she certainly wouldn't be at 100 percent.

"I know you said you didn't want to give me more power."

"I know you want me to die peacefully, but please let me at least inflict one last wound on him to help whoever fights him next!" Layla said to the Sword while raising it and holding it in both hands.

Suddenly, from the side, a large strike hit Laxmus, and he was sent flying through the air in the other direction. In a single blink, Layla had missed what had just happened.

Standing there where Laxmus once was, was a Knight adorning a Golden-Rose coloured armour with a giant, long sword in her hand and a katana blade on her back.

"She's right. The two of you can't fight each other right now if you want to have any chance of surviving this fight." The Golden-Rose knight gripped the hilt of her sword.

"I will make sure that all vampires are gone from this world!"

In the next instant, when Layla tightened her grip around the Sword, she didn't even see how the Knightess covered the distance between the two or how she managed to avoid her sword.

All Layla could see was blood spraying out in the air and the face of the person who had attacked her.

"E... rin.." Layla somehow managed to say the name of the Golden-Rose Knight, the queen of the Dhampirs.

***

# Chapter 1783: The Queen Attacks.

It was not the first time that Layla had a tussle with Erin. She was aware of who the person in the armour was. Because not too long ago, Layla and a group of the Red Vampires had gone out hoping to stop the Dhampirs' advance.

The truth was Layla was hoping that she could persuade them to leave and turn around. After all, she had a special link with Erin. However, it failed, but in the end, a fight broke out, and she even needed the power of the Celestial Sword.

It only took a couple of clashes against her, for Layla to confirm a few things. One, the amount of Qi they both had at the time was relatively even, but the power of the Dhampir, among other things such as the armour and weapons, made it so that Erin's strikes, speed and attack power were superior.

Then on top of that, there was the swordsmanship itself. Despite Layla trying to become a better swordsman, honing her skill with practice partners and more, she was no match against Erin.

There was no way she could beat Erin in a sword fight, which was why in the end, she had decided that if Erin wouldn't listen, the best thing to do was to retreat and defend the base. She also planned to discuss with Laxmus the best course of action.

Unknown to her, Laxmus was busy with his own plans, and on top of that, there was the problem with Vincent that had distracted her from the incoming threat.

Looking at Layla, Erin's eyes were emotionless even though she had attacked someone who once used to be her dear friend.

"Don't you feel anything?... Was it so easy to attack me?... why... why do you hate me?... Is it because of your urges?"

"Have you just decided to give in to them that I'm nothing to you? No! I Won't take that."

Layla had shifted her leg back a little and then directed the Qi towards the wound across her chest. The next moment, flames enveloped the wound created by Erin's sword slash and began to heal Layla.

At the same time, Layla's right eye was black again, and the veins running up her arms had also turned black.

"I have agreed to be your partner! And I can feel your pain. You don't desire to be killed by someone like this!" The sword shouted, powering her once more with energy.

Although the sword was helping Layla, it wasn't the same as when she was fighting Laxmus since she had used up most of her Qi reserve in the arrow attack.

Erin looked quite surprised when she found that a single attack wasn't enough to kill Layla, but just holding her sword in another position, around to her side, it looked like she was ready to go ahead with another slash again.

"I have to... observe... I need to see every moment and block this attack!" Layla thought, not even allowing herself to Blink.

As Erin moved from her position, it looked so light, so effortless. There wasn't even any crack on the ground from her movements, yet a strong force was behind it, and the attack was swiftly heading for Layla.

At that moment, Layla realised it didn't matter which way she swung her sword or how this attack would go.

"I just hoped my death wouldn't have come from you..." Layla mumbled.

Before Erin could reach Layla though, an intense beam of red energy came out from the side. Erin moved her sword to block her body, and suddenly a large ice barrier formed around the sword.

The red energy beam was destroying the ice fast and pushing Erin back.

"Ah, this attack, I know this well. Earlier my powers couldn't match yours, and I can see that you have a bit more strength this time."

"Well, unfortunately for you, I have gotten stronger since then, a lot stronger... and it's time for a payback!"

Erin's eyes started to glow yellow. Her hair started to rise in the air. Then, encasing her sword in Qi, Erin began to slice through the red beam rather than blasting the attack on her own.

She cut through, not wasting any movement, she slashed upward, left, right, diagonal and across, getting rid of the red aura. She continued to cut through the red beam.

Just as she got about mid-way through. Erin sensed something Activating the third ring on her demon tier weapon, she stabbed it into the ground, creating a huge ice barrier.

Leaving the sword in its place, Erin quickly pulled out her other weapon on her back and in a single motion, she cut through what looked like three arrows. The arrows, however, didn't break and instead burst into particles.

After cutting through the arrows though, a lot of black balls had hit her arms, and chains began to tie her up. Then, turning her head to the right, she found her ice barrier was shattered through and flying straight towards her was Laxmus.

If his breath attack didn't work, he would use his fists, which was exactly what he had done against the ice barrier. And now that it was out of the way, he had gathered two more red beams in his hands and threw them out towards Erin.

This time, Erin felt like she had no choice. Her armour began to glow brightly. This wasn't just any armour. Instead, it was a complete set of demon tier armour Erin had for herself. And the chains coiled around her arms disappeared when the armour began to glow.

She quickly went to grab the handle of her demon tier sword, and upon twisting the hilt, a red streak activated over the weapon, and the three circles on her sword started to light up.

Immediately, Erin slashed the sword out, sending out a ray of fire, which looked like the sword a giant snake made of flames was slithering out.

Redirecting the red beams towards the tunnel of flames, Laxmus had broken through, but he was no longer able to attack Erin.

Finding himself open, Laxmus jumped away and surprisingly landed not too far away from Layla.

At the same time, Erin had taken a step back as well, and now she was around twenty metres away from the two of them. The battle between Layla and Laxmus had already destroyed the area around them.

With everyone else having run off to fight the over dhampirs, no one was within the vicinity of the area.

"Both the Red Vampire leaders teamed up against me. I thought you pathetic vampires would have more pride than this. Do you see me bringing my teammates?" Erin asked.

Honestly, for Layla, who just had a life and death battle against Laxmus a few moments ago, leaving her on the brink of her death, it was strange for her to stand by Laxmus's side. However, since she saw that Laxmus wasn't looking her way and wasn't attacking her right now, in that small interaction, Laxmus must have known as well.

If they were to fight against this person one on one, there was a good chance that even someone like Laxmus would lose.

"I'll support you," Layla said, using the sword in its bow form again.

"If it comes to fighting her with a sword, I won't win. You're better at close combat, and you have your shadow. I'll help you the best I can."

Laxmus didn't reply, but no response was usually him agreeing.

"Both of you will fight me together? That will be better because it will only make me stronger!" Erin said with her eyes glowing an even brighter yellow. The dhampir energy instantly covered her entire body, and her hair began to fly back on its ends.

It was then that Laxmus started to chuckle.

"It's really troublesome," Laxmus said. "Enough for my master to decide to give me even more power... just so I can get rid of you. And that I will."

"I will get rid of this troublesome "Godslayer" for him!"

# Chapter 1784: On our side.

Since the Dhampirs had only attacked from one direction, the Red Vampires thought they might have an advantage. Therefore to contain the Dhampirs to one area, all the Red Vampires headed for the entrance from where the former had broken through and had begun the attack.

The vampires wanted to use the location to their advantage. And had decided that upon reaching the entrance, they would fire off their blood aura, use their beast weapons and everything at their disposal to attack the Dhampirs that were coming through.

However, the Dhampirs were able to push through, and even took down a large number of the Red Vampires for a few reasons. For one, the Dhampirs had all attacked from one location because they had predicted how the Red Vampires would act.

If they were all together, it actually gave a little boost to the Dhampirs being around so many vampires at once. Using this adrenaline rush, the Dhampirs could defeat the Red Vampires easier than they usually would have.

Another reason was the fears that vampires had in them regarding their counterparts. They believed that the Dhampirs were very powerful and dangerous, and this had already made them quite apprehensive about the incoming battle. But, regardless of all this, it wasn't the only reason the Dhampirs had an easier time.

The main reason behind this one-sided battle was that the Red Vampires were already injured in the first place. So even if they didn't feel any weaker, they were tired. They had been fighting each other a few moments ago and had consumed most of their strength and stamina due to strong attacks, and to heal their bodies from wounds.

Perhaps they were at 80 percent of their peak strength, but against such strong enemies, it was a considerable disadvantage. Eventually, the fighting spread out from one location. The Dhampirs had made the impact they needed to, and the Red Vampires were now retreating

The fighting had spread over several streets, on top of buildings, and even more throughout the city. Still, not everything was in favour of the Dhampirs as their progress was coming to a somewhat help due to one particular reason.

In each group of Red Vampires that were fighting, they had what they called True followers, the vampires with a marking. But, realising the severe nature of the fight, they had decided to transform.

These True followers, beaming with celestial power, took on all sorts of different forms, looking like different types of demons from all over. Their power was strong, and some were even able to kill a few Dhampirs here and there.

Something the regular Red Vampires hadn't been able to do.

One of the females in a group of four was on a rooftop of one of the buildings. She had a helmet on, which only the captains of the Dhampirs had. Firmly holding back her enemies, Captain Ni faced one of these True Followers.

Some Dhampirs in her group were injured by the transformed vampire and were finding it hard to heal.

"Remember, our Queen is fighting the hardest of them all! She is going through the worst and having the hardest time of all of us! So the least we can do is help her out a little!" Ni shouted to motivate her people.

It invigorated the others' spirit, and at that moment, all four of them split up. The others went towards Red Vampires, fighting them one on one, while the captain decided to go for the transformed vampire that looked like a regular vampire apart from all the tentacles sticking out from its back.

He held them out and went straight for Ni. She carefully avoided the first two, letting them hit the tile. At the same time, cutting the third and fourth tentacles going towards her.

Then she quickly swung her yellow sword, and a string of aura went out, and the True follower had done the same, swinging both hands, he created a criss-cross pattern in the air!

When both of the strikes had hit each other, to Ni's surprise, her attack had lost out. Suddenly she was grabbed by the tentacle in the air and slammed into the rooftop.

Out of desperation, Ni had to grit her teeth and make the tough decision. She slashed her sword at her own foot, slicing it cleanly off so the vampire could no longer hold her. Because of the impact, she rolled towards the True Follower on the ground and using her good leg, she hopped up. She touched her satchel, but there wasn't any knife so without hesitation, she threw her sword which hit the True Follower right in the middle of his forehead and killed him on the spot.

"This is a lot harder than we expected. We were told about the true followers, but for there to be this many of them?" Ni hopped over to where her foot was, and attaching it to her torso, she used her Qi powers to heal the wound until she finally reattached it.

One from her squad had died, and the other three survived. Unfortunately, this wasn't the end of the battle for them, as there were others and many more things they needed to deal with.

"With all these True followers… this battle might be quite even. I hope our Queen can achieve her objective so we can retreat as soon as possible." Ni said to herself.

"You are wrong about one thing" A voice said.

Suddenly, Ni felt herself in the air and wrapped around in shadow. She tried to use her Qi to disrupt the shadow, but it wasn't working. Looking at who it was and how they were dressed, Ni could tell that it was a Guardian.

"With us joining in this fight, this won't be even at all. Remember, you were the ones that had brought this on yourself, coming to us."

It was true. Ni had forgotten about the Guardians, who were a step above the True followers. Although the Dhampirs were stronger than most of the vampires and vampire elites, they didn't have many that could deal with an actual Guardian.

Flora and Erin were stronger than Guardians but were probably the only ones who could face them. This power gap was a pretty significant issue within the Dhampirs.

Holding out his finger, it looked like the guardians were ready to use a blood cannon on Ni making sure to finish her off once and for all. He thrusted his hand forward, and it had crunched back as a large force of red aura was sent Ni's way.

As it was about to reach her, another energy came and hit the aura head-on.

"What is that... is it lightning… but why is it red? Ni was taken aback. Did someone just save her? But who?"

Over at other locations, strange things were happening as well. Another Guardian was hit in the arm several times, while one was hit in the back. There were also reports of a vampire hitting others. Blue lightning was flashing across the whole settlement. The attack was that strong.

Back on the previous battlefield, as Ni tried to regain her composure, a woman with a spear stepped forward.

"We made our choice," Lucia stated. "We originally came here to pay back the Red Vampires for what they did to us. So you damn Guardians are our number one targets."

Lifting the spear, Lucia swung it down at the shadow hand. It was covered in red lighting and had broken through the shadow, which surprised the guardian. Then, just as he was about to act, another attack came from behind, similar to the woman in front.

"What is going on here?!" the Guardian shouted, deeply confused.

Ni was now on her knees, thankful to the stranger who had saved her. She could tell she was a human and not a dhampir or vampire. She wondered what a human was doing in a place like this and even wanted to thank her, but before she could react, the tip of the spear was pointed in her face.

"They told me to make something very clear. We are here for them, but not to help you. So if anyone gets in our way, we will get rid of them too."

*** *** ***

At the same time, someone else announced the same words.

"Now that you heard what I said," Peter replied. "Tell me, why the F*ck did you just try and attack me?" Peter asked, staring at Flora after having just crashed on the ground, landing between her and Xander.

# Chapter 1785: Crazy Group.

The last way Jake ever expected to enter the Red Vampire base was falling through the sky. Perhaps it would have been a relaxing moment for him if it wasn't for the fact that he was heading straight into a War zone.

Even now, still high up in the air, he could see blasts of energy shooting off in different directions. One attack nearly hit him, but Jake had to harden his arm and was able to whack it away.

"What aim was that... how did an attack from below get up here! Damn it Peter! Damn you all. Dad, you never warned me that I would be travelling with a bunch of idiots!" Looking around him, Jake could see that Peter's attack pushed away everyone, and it looked like they would all end up landing in a different location. However, one person, in particular, seemed to be having a peaceful fall down.

It was the beautiful vampire Muka. She had her eyes closed as if she knew all of the attacks from below would miss her, and indeed, none of the attacks even came close to her.

"What kind of trickery is that? Anyway, I can't focus on other people. I need to focus on my own situation. If I had known we would be falling, I would have brought a wind ability or something."

In the end, thinking of his abilities, he decided the only thing he could do was harden his body and crash into the ground, which was exactly what he did. His hard body skidded and bounced across a whole street, crushing everything from the impact like a meteor.

It had even hit a few Dhampir and vampires, severely injuring them. When Jake could finally balance himself, he turned around and instantly covered both hands with blue lightning.

"I'm sorry, dad, I think I broke your portal, but in return, I'll try to get rid of these headaches for you."

Taking advantage of the confusion and chaos, Jake used his super-speed, rushed to a nearby vampire, and grabbed it by the head. Since his hands had the power of lighting in them, the vampire could feel pain going through his body, and in the next second, a sped-up hardened knee smashed the vampire in the face.

Just then, a whip of yellow aura had come towards Jake. Seeing this, he jumped and spun in the air, avoiding the blow. Then, as soon as he landed, he fired two lightning strikes at the attacking Dhampir, hitting her on the shoulder and in the stomach, instantly killing her.

As soon as the first Dhampir fell, another one came from the side and this one decided to use her weapon. When she jumped and swung it down from above, Jake lifted his hand and used his hardened hand to block the attack.

At the same time as lifting his hand, Jake stomped his foot, and in doing so, two spikes from the earth with hardened tips stabbed the Dhampir in the leg. This chance allowed Jake to quickly hit the man in the stomach and send him flying into another building.

"Lighting, Hardening, Earth and super speed. I love using all of these abilities together." Jake smiled to himself as he continued forward and went to attack the other vampire that was straight ahead.

Since both Dhampirs and vampires were attacking him, Jake had no qualms about attacking both factions. After all, the Green family weren't really on the Red Vampires or the Dhampir's side. Both groups were headaches for the former.

However, when he threw out a fist of lighting, it stopped before touching the last vampire as a wall of shadow appeared in front of him.

"Oh, it looks like I hit the jackpot. I've been looking for you Guardian guys since you disturbed our tournament!" Jake claimed.

"There seem to be more annoying people joining this fight!" the Guardian replied, sinking into his shadow and appearing on top of one of the buildings away from Jake.

"But the darkness is our dominion, and there are shadows everywhere that I can use." The Guardian stated.

It was then that something began to appear from the ground. Jake noticed that it was hard to see where the shadows were because of the dark inside the place. However, he could soon see whatever was coming out of the shadows.

"Man, you guys have more of these things... and I thought only he could summon them."

Out of the shadow, beasts came out, but not just any beasts, these were the same types that Laxmus summoned in the tournament, and he clearly remembered that these beasts also had the shadow power.

At the same time, the other guardians were doing a similar thing in different locations. It looked like just the Guardian were not the trump card, but these special beasts were too.

The Red Vampires were pushing the Dhampirs back, much more than they could have ever imagined.

—— ——

Two people crashed from the sky at once somewhere on the battlefield, destroying the building from their momentum alone. One of them was Jessica, and because of the impact of the fall, she was a bit hurt and was coughing hard because of the dust.

Then, looking down at her chest, she found a little girl sitting on her.

"Are you alright? Did you get hurt, Minny?" She said in a pained voice, finding it hard to breathe.

Minny eventually got off, brushing a few crumbs from the building off her. Immediately though, she bared her fangs when she heard footsteps rushing into the building. Four dhampirs had their swords out, pointed towards them.

"Wait, don't attack. I'm one of you!" Jessica said, quickly transforming her eye and making it turn yellow. Although only one of her eyes had turned, which the dhampirs found strange, they could recognise the energy well.

"Wait, that little girl, she's a vampire!" One of the dhampirs shouted and immediately slashed his sword towards her. Jessica pulled out her dagger at that moment, parrying away the sword.

"Damn you guys, are you so cruel to even attack a little child?!" She shouted.

"That's not a child, she's a vampire, and we must eliminate all vampires!" Dhampir shouted.

Four of them at once would be a bit too much for Jessica to handle, but before Jessica could even move to attack, she saw that someone else had made a move. It was Minny. She was already in the air and instantly appeared behind one of the Dhampirs.

And while in the air, she had already transformed into her little devil-like form, and with a single swipe, she had sliced the Dhampir's head off, and blood spilt everywhere.

As Minny landed on the ground, she quickly ran off again, swiping at the other dhampirs' legs, and as she hit them, large chunks of their limbs would go missing.

"Get the vampire!" One of the Dhampir cried in pain.

"She's too fast! I've never seen a vampire like this before. What the hell is she?!" another one screamed.

Honestly, even Jessica was shocked at this scene. She didn't know Minny could be this... brutal, especially as a child. She quickly got a hold of herself and started to use her strings to attack the distracted Dhampirs' legs and pulled on them, making them fall to the ground.

"Minny, you can stop now!" Jessica shouted, but another group ran into the building, and this time it was the Red Vampires.

—— ——

Outside, away from most of the fighting, one large scale fight was going on. Peter was attacking Flora with his special head-tail. He had transformed using his celestial energy, and Flora was on the defensive.

She was using all her aura and strength to stop all the incoming attacks from the head-tail. However, her hand began to turn numb, and whenever an opportunity arose, Peter would punch her straight in the stomach and send her flying into the buildings.

"Dad... who is that person," June was shocked by this display of strength.

Xander was still in disbelief as he rubbed his eyes.

"It... it's Peter, but how is he here?"

Then in answer to his daughter's question, he replied, "Peter is someone your dad beat a long time ago."

"You can't be joking at this moment, Dad," Kev replied, "That guy is a lot stronger than you."

"I know," Xander replied. "Which is why I'm wondering what happened to him?"

Just then, Peter returned from his fight and appeared on the rooftop in front of them. In his hands, he was holding half-unconscious and thoroughly bloodied Flora by her hair.

Peter had defeated the second strongest Dhampir just like that.

# Chapter 1786: Return of the King!

Although Layla was aiming her bow and arrow at Erin, she hadn't realised it. She was careful in her next move and was waiting for what Laxmus would do next. On the other side, Erin was also ready to battle against the Red Vampire leaders and to aid her in this, she had very powerful means.

For one, the armour she was currently wearing, what it exactly did, what its properties were, and how much would it aid her in this fight. So far, it had broken the spiritual chains that bound her, which Laxmus could do as well, but it took more time for him.

Then there were her Dhampir powers, swordsmanship skills and demon-tier weapons that she had kept with herself for a long time.

"If both of you will just continue staring at me, then I guess it's up to me to get this show started!" Erin stabbed her sword into the ground, and a trail of ice spread across the floor, aiming straight for Layla and Laxmus.

Seeing this, Laxmus clenched his fists and punched the ground when the ice was just a few inches away from him, shattering and stopping it there.

Surprisingly, Layla could also block the ice with the help of her Qi.

"Did he use pure physical strength to block that ice? I'm sure anything that touches the ice coming from that sword will be frozen." Layal thought.

On closer inspection of Laxmus though, she noticed he had small parts of the shadow constantly moving over his entire celestial body form.

"You have been a pain in my backside for a long time." Laxmus said as shadow started to spurt out from his leg and began to cover the entire area the three were fighting in.

Eventually, it rose, creating a shadow dome that encased all three of them inside.

Laxmus then opened his mouth and fired a blood breath beam straight toward Erin. However, rather than blocking the attack this time, she quickly stepped out of the way but instantly had to defend herself using her sword from the three incoming Qi arrows.

Slashing her sword in a perfect motion, Erin was able to slice through all of them and block the attacks. However, by now, Laxmus had enough time to prepare another attack, Since the blood breath had missed the target, it went straight at the shadow dome's wall behind Erin and returned from a different direction after getting reflected.

Jumping at the right time again, Erin avoided the attack once again. However, this time while she was in the air, she twisted the handle of her sword and covered it in flames before striking down on the red blood beam, slicing through it.

But by the time she landed, Layla had again fired another set of arrows, this time five at once. The truth was Layla couldn't summon so many Qi arrows at once, but using her ability, she was able to hold on somehow, and that's what she had done to fire five at once, and she did it at the perfect moment.

On top of that, she had moved into the perfect position for her next attack.

"I need to stop considering her as the old Erin and start thinking of her as the bitch that just tried to kill me moments ago."

The arrows were too fast for Erin to use her sword to block this time, so instead, she decided to activate her armour once more. It lit up, and when the arrows hit her, it looked like they passed right through her. And instead, they hit the shadow done behind Erin, which displaced a bit before recovering back to its original state.

"Watch your aim!" Laxmus shouted, charging in his bare fists now that he was annoyed. Erin went to strike with her sword swinging it, but Laxmus instantly grabbed it with his bare hand and kicked her in the stomach.

Perhaps it looked like a normal kick in the shadow space, but Layla knew that kick had enough force to destroy mountains. And when Laxmus kicked Erin and sent her flying into the air, he disappeared from the spot using his shadow, only to appear right behind her.

At that point, Erin had stabbed her large sword to the ground to get hold of herself and brought out her Katana blade, swinging it behind her. This time, the attack was a lot faster, and when Laxmus tried to grab it once again, he had missed it entirely.

However, as the katana hit his hands, it didn't hurt Laxmus. Erin wasn't bothered by this and slashed the katana at Laxmus from a different direction. Since she was no longer using the large sword, she could move at a much faster speed, much faster than Laxmus, as he couldn't do a thing to catch her.

Layla fired another few arrows from behind but even while in the middle of attacking Laxmus, Erin deflected the incoming attack, taking out the arrows with ease.

"A sneak attack will never work on me. Do you forget what power I have!" Erin shouted.

Her whole katana lit up yellow, and then slashing from up to down in one smooth motion, she made a large attack, which cut through the shadow dome and even sliced through the walls of the settlement on the outside.

It had cut through everything that came in its way, including Laxmus. Although he had no deep cut on his body, there was a diagonal slash over his face.

Now extremely infuriated, Laxmus managed to move faster than he usually would have, and instead of trying to grab the weapon, he caught both of Erin's arms.

Holding her still, he opened his mouth wide and stretched it, gathering the red aura he usually would.

Quickly seeing this, Layal decided to run over towards the sword. With it being a demon weapon, as long as she got her hands on it, it would give her a power boost, even if she didn't use it and just had it on her back.

However, the second the beam had left Laxmus's mouth, Erin's armour lit up again, and once again, they saw the attack go right through Erin without hurting her.

And just like that, she was also able to get out of Laxmus's grasp and then, moving her sword, she released all her yellow aura and putting all her strength into one attack, she stabbed the katana Laxmus right through his stomach.

Laxmus was genuinely surprised. His shadow, his celestial body, and even the fact that he was an original vampire, far stronger than the others, none of that had seemed to work against this woman. Her attacks didn't feel tough and powerful, and neither did this woman seem to have anything special in her, yet why was he unable to defeat her.

"I know what you're thinking. You don't understand, do you? It's simple. I am just different from you in every way."

"A simple action from me has a far greater significance than yours ever will be. And soon, I will make you realise that you amount to nothing!" Erin shouted.

Laxmus went to swipe toward Erin, but she quickly moved back, and his attack missed the target.

While dodging Laxmus's attack, Erin sensed another power building up not far from her.

She turned around and saw that Layla had the Demon tier sword in her hands, which wasn't just one demon-tier weapon but two, with the attachment.

"Erin, what has happened to you?! Have you forgotten everything? Why do you hate us so much? Why do you hate vampires?"

"Look at the sword you are using and the skill that you have. Wasn't that all taught to you by Leo? What do you think he would think!" Layla shouted.

"Leo... he was a great teacher. But in the end, he was a vampire, and we all know what has to happen to vampires."

"They can't control themselves, and they would eventually kill everyone. So I must get rid of all of them."

Hearing Erin talk just felt strange to Layla. It wasn't like this was some urge to kill vampires. Instead, it was more like she genuinely believed in those words.

"Now be a little darling and give me back my weapon before you hurt yourself!" Erin demanded.

"You can forget the sword unless you come to your senses!" Layla shouted. "What happened to you? What happened to you and Leo? Is that what changed everything?!"

Behind them, Laxmus had finally pulled out the sword from his stomach and instantly placed it in his shadow. Now, Erin could no longer use the katana blade she had been using, which meant she had no weapon, and although Erin was strong, she was mainly a swordsman.

"This bare hand against the two you would be tiring, and I'm going to need a weapon, so you leave me with no choice," Erin gritted her teeth, ignoring Layla's words and keeping an eye out for Laxmus.

A dark portal opened right next to Layla, and as she turned around, she saw a giant claw coming right at her. Unfortunately, because she was focused on Erin, she moved a moment too late, and the tip of the claw instantly sliced at the wrist, cutting her arm.

"The attack went through my second stage Qi so easily... who is this?"

Layla was shocked by this, and when her maimed hand fell on the ground, so did the sword. But Layla had no choice but to retreat and use the flames to stop the bleeding, and that's when she saw her assailant's face.

It was an enormous, terrifying monster with claws so long that they scraped the ground. But for Layla, this monster was familiar because it once belonged to someone close to her.

***

# Chapter 1787: The dhampir Urge.

Without a doubt, what Layla was looking at right now was the Boneclaw. One of the Four Kings of the Familiar World. Once again, someone she hadn't seen in a long time had stirred long-forgotten memories.

The Boneclaw... he was initially linked with Quinn. But when Quinn went into slumber, this Familiar left him."

"Later, the vampires were less and less inclined to use Familiars due to all the deaths that kept occurring with them. I heard the rumours but didn't think it would be true. What do Erin and Quinn have in common for them both to be able to link with the Boneclaw?" Layla thought.

Staggering a bit, Layla could see that her vision had faded slightly. It was not because of the wound on her hand that had already been somewhat sealed. Instead, it was because of the energy of the Black Sword. "You are close to your limit of containing the power If the celestial energy from me consumes you completely, it's unlikely that you could get out. Who knows what will become of you then." The sword warned.

When the sword said these words, Layla felt a stinging pain in her left eye, which was now already half black.

Boneclaw lifted the Demon tier sword with its large claws and teleported, appearing beside Erin and then handing her sword back. Seeing this as an opportunity, Layla used her telekinesis powers to pull her hand and bring it back towards her.

Eventually, she reattached the hand with her green flames again. She rotated her wrist a few times to ensure everything was in working order, but she didn't have much time to do anything else as a claw was heading her way.

Immediately using her black sword, which had long since reverted to its original shape, she clashed against the long claws of Boneclaw. There seemed to be a struggle of powers, but Layla won out as she pushed through.

Before she could follow with strength in her attack, she felt like the pressure against her had disappeared, and that was because it had. The Boneclaw was no longer in front of her.

"Behind you!" The sword shouted.

Listening to the words, Layla spun around and tried to block the attack. Her manoeuvre was extremely lucky as she pushed back the incoming attack.

"Let me take over. I'll protect you. You trust me now, right? You trust that I can take care of both of us and make it out of this alive."

"So you just focus on not letting the energy take over, and I'll protect both of us."

There was no other option for Layla, and the veins that were shooting up her arms, although others couldn't see them, had now shot to her heart and partly up her head towards her brain.

One of Layla's eyes was still one-third white. When Boneclaw went to attack again, Layla parried him away and even went on offence by sending a strike at him.

She hit the beast, causing it to push its shoulder back in an attempt to diffuse the blow as the attack's impact also caused it to stop the relentless teleporting attacks.

"I taught you everything I knew about swordsmanship, but you never were meant to use the sword."

"In the end, you can fight better with your own powers, which is why we decided not to go down this path."

"However, this damned monster is weaker than the other two you were fighting, so I will at least beat him for you!" The sword shouted, giving itself confidence despite no one being able to hear it.

*** *** ***

Erin started to spin her sword, and as she did, the momentum would create heat waves, and suddenly, they would change to frost as well. She had long mastered the attachment demon tier item and the sword to switch between the two seamlessly.

"Now that the other one is no longer distracting us, the two of us can fight to our fullest!" Erin shouted while tightening the grip over her sword.

Although Laxmus didn't say anything, every cell in his body was at boiling point. There had never been someone in the whole universe he wanted to crush more than her.

The shadow dome surrounding them started sinking as it returned to Laxmus. Since it wasn't working, there was no use for it. His arm was still bleeding, and so was his stomach.

The first to act was Laxmus, as he threw out both of his fists at the same time toward Erin. He was too far from her for his attacks to work, but halfway through his attack, enormous shadow fists had come out and went straight to crush Erin.

Jumping in the air, Erin avoided the incoming blows and allowed them to hit the ground, creating a mini crater. Then, she activated the first ring of her sword and shot out an ice spike towards the shadow.

On the other hand, while still in the air, Laxmus attempted to use his blood breath. But by this time. Erin had twisted her wrist and directed the attack towards him, but instead of snow spike, it was a fire breath.

When landing on her ice spike attack from earlier, it didn't affect her, and she used it as a footing to push off from, heading straight towards Laxmus without any hesitation.

Laxmus threw his fist again from a distance, his shadow extended, coming at Erin like a large pole. Although this attack once again completely missed Erin, it didn't matter.

The shadow expanded and quickly spread out like a spider web. The same thing happened with the other fist, and both were beginning to get inter linked. It happened so fast that some of it even brushed Erin before she could react.

And the moment the shadow came in contact with Erin, she felt her movements slow down. It looked like the shadow web from all around was slowly enveloping her and was decreasing in size.

Just then, Laxmus had pushed off the second his spider web caught Erin, and his fist was glowing red as he threw it right towards her head, intending to finish her off in a single attack.

"I can get out of here if I activate my armour, but that's going to take some time. Erin thought, so instead of taking a risk with the armour, she did something else." Right before Laxmus's fist could hit her, an object appeared in between the two of them.

It glowed before bearing its shape, but a dark purple shell materialised, bracing Erin from the impact.

*** *** ***

Now far away from this fight, on one of the half destroyed buildings, Lucia was looking at the whole fight, and she wasn't alone as captain Ni was with her as well. They had fought together and defended themselves from anyone who attacked them and when the shadow dome disappeared, it caught many people's attention, including these two.

"How… how does she have the Familiar that once belonged to the Graylash family." Lucia clenched her hand.

"I don't know, but I will find out once that fight is over." A voice replied, and it was one Lucia had become familiar with.

"Peter... and... and…"

She had recognised him but not the three others by his side. After Xander had explained himself, Peter allowed him to come with him, and Peter surprisingly remembered him well. At first, Xander thought he might get hit, but Peter had asked if he was okay, leading them to this.

Xander had truthfully told Peter that although he wasn't heavily injured, Layla was in big trouble, and Xander then even asked a favour, even though he knew he didn't deserve one, and he had requested Peter to help Layla, and save her life. By the time Peter reunited with Lucia, Xander had explained everything he could to Peter, enough for the latter to understand the ongoing situation and make his own judgments.

However, after looking at the ongoing fight in front of him, Peter decided it was better to not jump into it straight away and let the two faction leaders weaken each other and then, on the right moment, he would swoop in and deal with the weakened one, Since none of the two were really their allies, he didn't care who the weakened party away, as long as Layla was alright.

"It's a Dhampir!" June said, baring her fangs and ready to attack, but Lucia quickly stood up.

"It's okay... she's not hurting anyone. We saved each others' lives a couple of times... I can vouch for her She's not going to do anything" Lucia said.

"What about their urge?" Kev pointed. "You vouch how many times you want, but we all know they can't help themselves against the urge."

"That's not true," Ni answered. "Although we indeed have an urge when we are near vampires, we cany use this to either strengthen us or simply suppress it. Trust me, not just I, but all the Dhampir can control themselves."

Upon hearing this, a strange look of confusion appeared on everyone's face, including Xander, because this was not what they had been made to believe.

"Wait, what about your Queen? Is she the same? Can she control this urge?" Xander asked.

Ni nodded. "Of course. After all, she was the one who taught us how to control it."

***

# Chapter 1788: All four in one place.

The shell that had appeared in front of Erin to block Laxmus's punch wasn't an ordinary shell, nor was it a beast item. Instead, it was another Familiar and one of the legendary Four Kings known for his defensive shell and massive turtle-like body, Genbu.

Of course though, despite the shell getting more robust over the years as Genbu de-shelled and got new ones, it was nothing in front of a being like Laxmus's fists because the latter had enough strength to destroy mountains and quite possibly the Earth itself if hit and directed at the right spot.

However, Erin had already predicted this but still used the shell for a reason that it was a backup plan, and it did work because the shell turned out to be strong enough to give her a few moments to get a hold of herself.

The shell cracked and was slowly getting destroyed as the force spread out. Finally, when it dispersed into energy particles, Laxmus's fist continued onward, but Erin was no longer there, having escaped the shadow's spider web.

This fight wasn't over yet, and neither of them was willing to give up as both readied themselves to continue this battle.

*** *** ***

The group was observing the fight between the two from far away, and after hearing what Ni had just said, they were starting to release many of them, and the others, hardly knew anything about the dhampirs. Vampires were just taking in what they had learnt and been taught for years, about the dangerous nature of the dhampirs, and because many vampires were being targeted and attacked by the latter regularly, the new generations took it as fact, but now, after hearing about another side of the story, it didn't seem like things were as straightforward as they had all believed.

"Wait, isn't that the Boneclaw that Quinn used to have?" Peter finally noticed the huge figure fighting off Layla.

"I am pretty sure that's Quinn's familiar, but didn't she also use that turtle? How can a person have two familiars? I thought that wasn't possible."

Honestly, the others were confused about many things too, and most of them hadn't even heard of the Familiars.

"I'm really not sure," Xander replied. "The Familiars have been acting strangely with the vampires after the war."

"Contracts became almost impossible to form, and those vampires that did get contracts were killed by their Familiars, so we stopped the whole thing altogether."

"You must keep one thing in mind, these aren't just any familiars. Those are the Kings that rule that world. Maybe the rules don't apply to them, or Erin figured out some way to make it like this?" One person, in particular, was devastated by this news, and she couldn't hold it in.

"Ni, you have to explain to me. Why does she have that turtle spirit thing? I must get to the bottom of this!"

"Tell me, Ni... Was Erin who killed Owen Graylash?!" There was a reason for Lucia's little theory.

The familiar Genbu had stayed with Owen and stayed with him for a long time through his struggles to establish a safe haven for everyone. So much so that there was even a statue of this Familiar on the main Graylash planet.

It was why Lucia also knew of the turtle, but for what the elders of Graylash family had told them, these spirits or familiars, as she heard the others call, didn't leave their host's side unless they or the latter died. So seeing Erin with it, she could only think of one thing, and her friendliness to the Dhampir captain was on thin ice.

"I'm sorry, Lucia, I know you want an answer, but I honestly don't know," Ni replied.

"This is the first time I have seen our Queen use it in battle. She has used the other one before but not this one. However, I want to give you the answers you are looking for because you saved my life."

"Although I don't know anything about it, someone else might. The first dhampir that Erin turned, Flora, has always been by the former's side. So I am sure she might know the answer."

At that moment, Xander and his two kids turned to look at Peter shaking their heads and almost facepalming.

Not too long ago, Peter had managed to defeat Flora with ease. In fact, he had dragged her out of the rubble by her hair.

However, the kids started to shout at Peter and came toward him. Since Peter had no clue who these people were, including Xander, Peter believed them to be more enemies and jumped back.

In that split second, Flora took advantage of Peter's wariness against the trio, she hit the floor with the heel of her foot and, using all her dhampir energy, shattered the rooftop, causing them both to fall. Unfortunately, by the time they regained their composure, Flora was nowhere to be seen.

Since Peter thought he had more people to deal with, he didn't even bother chasing Flora and felt that even if he let someone as weak as her left running about, it wouldn't change anything.

"We could have gotten a lot of answers from her. For instance, what happens to Owen?"

"And the familiars? Also, most importantly, why is Erin being like this, and why does she hate the vampires so much?"

*** *** ***

The battle in front of them continued with neither person getting the upper hand. It looked like Laxmus was slowly getting faster, his hits getting more powerful, and they weren't sure if it was an illusion, but his size was getting bigger as well.

As the fight continued, Laxmus carried on with more powerful techniques, different blood abilities and such. This was all because his so-called master was supplying him with more energy as the fight continued. Laxmus had only one goal: to defeat the person in front of him, but still, despite all of this, Laxmus was failing.

"I've had enough!" He shouted so loud at the top of his lungs that it resounded throughout the underground settlement. "I will beat you no matter what I have to do!"

Letting out a large wide-range beam, Laxmus tried to hit Erin, or at least this is what she thought he was trying to do, but she noticed it was the first time he had made such a wide-range blood breath attack compared to his normal single beam.

That's when she noticed that Laxmus had both hands raised, and the shadow in his hands looked like flames.

At the same time while this was happening, the others who were fighting against the Guardians noticed something. Ashely, Muka, Jake, Shiro, Mitchell, Hannah and the Dhampirs suddenly noticed their opponent's shadow powers had dispersed.

"What... what did you do?" One of the guardians shouted in panic.

"I didn't do anything," Ashley replied. "I can't use the shadow myself."

The two of them looked off in the distance, and after concentrating, they could see the shadow either leaving their bodies from their feet or the crystal. Their powers were disappearing, being sucked from them and heading in a certain direction.

*** *** ***

"I originally owned the shadow, and by adding it with Celestial powers, I have made the shadow stronger than ever! With this power, I will become a god of the shadows and make it so everyone suffers the same fate I once did."

"The fear of the sun, the fear of sunlight, the pain it brings is excruciating. Everyone, human beings, life forms, or anything that lives will experience what I had to go through. I will become the God of Darkness." Laxmus's words once again resounded throughout the settlement.

And when he finished his words, the shadow began to envelop him and turn solid, leading to a whole new transformation of Laxmus.

Over his shoulder, giant shoulder guards with several spikes sticking out for them appeared. Next, shadow armour appeared on his forearms and body, and this armour had the same face, somewhat like how Laxmus's current face looked like. Then on top of his head, two horns appeared, solidified by his shadow but looked partially cut off as they were thick and flat at the end rather than sharp and pointy.

Finally, clasping both hands together, Laxmus began to create a separate attack, and this one too looked like Laxmus's normal blood breath, but instead of red, this one was dark in colour. It didn't have the same consistency as his shadow powers but was undoubtedly the same colour, and it looked like even Laxmus was struggling to condense the substantial amount of energy because his hands were shaking.

"It looks like I might need everyone's help for this one!" Erin shouted, and just then, a light appeared below her, and what emerged was none other than another Familiar King, the great horse that a certain person used to ride. It was glowing with a green aura from its nostrils and eyes.

At the same time, another black cat figure appeared on Erin's shoulder, quickly moving to her head.

And while these two appeared, Erin clutched her demon tier weapon as her armour also began to shine.

"This is the end!" She shouted as the horse charged forward, and Laxmus unleashed his dark beam of energy toward her.

# Chapter 1789: Wave of yellow energy.

The people who knew about the Familiars, or had researched them or maybe were around when they were more common were shell-shocked upon witnessing the scene in front of them.

It was already incredible for a person to have two Familiars, but now, they were stumped upon seeing all four kings linked to a single person, because it was an unprecedented event for everyone at the scene.

Either way, it was something that they didn't have much time to think about. Erin and Laxmus had moved at an incredible speed, and an immense amount of powers clashed at once.

The shockwave from the clash instantly destroyed the last remaining buildings around the area. It was an invisible wave that shook the air itself, and even though the buildings were made from reinforced material from a different planet, not from earth, the aftershock destroyed them.

The vibrations caused all buildings to crumble right there and then, including the one where the others were watching form. The very flooring collapsed, and everyone braced themselves.

The fighting throughout the large settlement was coming to a stop. Members of both factions were now more focused on saving themselves from the aftermath of the battle between their leaders.

After the initial wave that had crushed the buildings, more shockwaves came out, and the force was enough to send many to their knees. Both the vampires and dhampirs were strong, and they couldn't help but wonder how such an energy force could make them feel this way.

When the shockwaves went through their bodies, it was like someone had hit them from the inside out. and eventually, a few of them even started to cough out blood.

"Is everyone okay?!" Xander shouted.

He was holding up the roof they were standing on a few moments ago, and because of the shockwaves, it got destroyed, and they fell to the ground. As for why he was holding up, it was to save his children from getting crushed.

"Dad, we are strong enough to hold that ourselves, you know? You don't have to try and act all cool in front of us." June shook her head, although the corner of her lips was curved upwards.

Meanwhile, Kev helped push the piece of rubble off, and the three of them looked to see if the others were okay, and that's when they could see Peter standing upright, although half of the rubble and one whole side wall were on his head.

It looked as if part of a building fell on him, but he simply had just stood there, allowing it to crash on his hard head, but what was surprising and making the two kids snicker a bit was what he was holding.

He held Lucia in a princess carry in his hands, and his face was hunched over hers, staring at her.

"Did you get hurt?" Peter asked.

"N... No..." Lucia answered, and rather than be embarrassed and jump out of Peter's arms quickly, she decided to stay like this for a few moments. Besides, Peter was strong, right? He could hold a frail woman like Lucia for a few moments.

"Hey, what about me...you could have protected me as well!" Ni shouted, pushing a few of the rocks off of her leg. She had seen Peter rush over and thought he would protect both of them, but he had just grabbed Lucia and didn't even glance at her.

"Hey! Look!" Kev's shout suddenly attracted everyone's attention.

The energy waves continued spreading, but now a giant ball of energy also appeared where the two were fighting seconds ago. It was growing bigger and smaller as if the power was trying to condense itself.

"It reminds me of when Quinn... beat Graham," Peter mumbled.

It certainly looked like that, but the energy here was different. Rather than Quinn condensing the energy and using his own powers, this was a clash of two powers, and the yellow orb of energy looked far more unstable than when Quinn had condensed the energy.

While Peter was thinking about this, the yellow energy was getting larger and larger by the second. Finally, it consumed the ground around it and had already reached the first set of buildings that were originally around the lab.

"This doesn't look good!" Xander said. "Layla get out of there!" he screamed at the top of his lungs, hoping Layla had heard. Even now, it seemed like she was somewhat fighting against the Boneclaw.

Although the two were moving away from the enlarging energy sphere, they were still fighting and the closest to it.

In the end, Peter started running away while holding Lucia in her hands.

"As much as I would like to jump in at the last second and take out Laxmus or Erin, the most important thing is survival!"

Maybe because the celestial energy was influencing Peter, but he could feel that this expanding ball of energy was very powerful. However, it was not just him, everyone could feel it and knew they needed to escape it. So, without hesitation, everyone began to run towards the exit.

However, as everyone turned around to run, the yellow ball of energy instantly expanded. It first consumed Layla, and in the next instant, it had covered the entire settlement.

As the energy went and grazed everyone, they couldn't hear, feel or see anything. When they opened their eyes, all they could see was a bright flash of white light in front of them.

This made many of them think that they were dead, that they were no more, and this was the afterlife, but after a few moments the light began to fade, and the first thing everyone noticed was the familiar ceiling of their settlement, where they lived underground, a large part of your life.

Most of the vampires and dhampirs were on the ground, and slowly they started to get up and turned their heads, wondering what had happened or what was going on. The buildings were still destroyed, but their bodies felt slightly weird as if the energy within them had been partly zapped.

Still, a few began to attack as soon as they saw an enemy dhampir or vampire.

As Peter got up, he checked if everyone around him was alright, and they were, but even he had collapsed and was on the floor.

"What happened... wait, what happened to the fight?!" Peter shouted.

He turned around, and with the whole settlement turning almost flat after the fight, it was easier for them all to see. Jessica, Minny, and everyone alive turned in the direction of where the great energy had come from and there, they saw Erin standing with her demon-tier sword in her hand. She wasn't on her horse and had her back facing away from Laxmus.

It was the same for Laxmus. He stood motionless in his horrifying black form that looked far more frightening than a Bloodsucker. Both were unmoving, and anyone who noticed this had stopped fighting as they were waiting for either one of their leaders to move.

In the end... Laxmus's large body collapsed and fell face-first on the floor. It fell straight, unmoving as if there was no support from his muscles at all, and at the same time, in the area around them, several items started to spew out, being chucked in all sorts of different directions. Some of the large, some of them small.

Laxmus had stored all of these items in his shadow, and now that he was dead, they were coming out for everyone to see, At that moment, Erin leapt up and caught two items, her blade and the Red Heart.

"I must admit it wasn't as easy as I thought, but I have done it," Erin said, placing the stone inside her armour and away in a safe place. Then turning around, she raised her sword.

"I can't leave a job unfinished, can I?"

Saying this, Erin moved towards Layla, who was just now getting up from the ground. Since she was closest to the initial attack, she had taken the longest time to recover, and there was something else as well, she didn't have her black sword. It was at least a few meters away from her. Therefore, there was no way for her to defend against the incoming Erin.

"Run, Layla!!! Run!!!" Xander shouted at the top of his lungs and had already started to run as fast as he could. Swinging his arms, he was throwing out his red aura, but he was far too far for his attacks to reach Erin. The projectiles hit nothing but the ground.

Erin then raised her sword at Layla and activated the first ring.

"Burn," She whispered, and a tunnel of flames came out of it, heading straight towards Layla.

Layla tried to move, but it felt like her legs weren't listening to her and all she could do was watch the flames come toward her to engulf her and the person she once called her closest friend, now become the person behind her demise.

"I owe Quinn a lot, so it would be unfair if you died here." A voice resounded.

In the next moment, someone appeared between her and the approaching flames, and before she could even react, this person threw one blow at the oncoming attack, and instantly the flame dissipated.

"Vorden..." Layla whispered, her eyes widened upon seeing the person in front of her.

"Well tried, you're almost right. I will give you another guess." Borden winked.
