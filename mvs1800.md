# Chapter 1800: Push.

Two things were going on at once when fighting against Athos. After the two of them had decided to approach the Celestial from the opposite direction, Sil used his fast speed to sprint straight towards Athos.

"I must admit, you are much bigger than any other Celestial I have fought against, but size doesn't mean you are stronger!" Sil shouted.

Just like with Quinn, the female golden Amra had decided to interfere in the fight and swung her swords down, but when it looked like Sil was about to get hit by the incoming attack, he disappeared from his spot.

And in the next instant, he appeared on top of her head.

He lifted his leg high, and with it, he had created a tornado of flames. Then, without hesitation, he slammed the kick on the female Amra. The fire quickly spread, and it looked like her whole body was about to be consumed in flames.

However, Athos had already fired an arrow, which flew through the air too fast for Sil to react, hitting him right through his stomach. However, when it hit him, Sil's body disappeared from the spot, leaving no signs of injury or blood.

The female Amra was grateful that her God had saved her, but she soon felt an enormous force hitting her right at the back of her legs.

It was so strong that her leg skid forward, stumbling her whole body as she fell back to the ground.

As for the person responsible for this, it was none other than Sil, or to be more specific, there were a bunch of Sils, ten to be precise.

They were divided into two equal groups of five, and they were pushing each leg using their strengthening ability to the max.

They had secretly appeared there when the fight began, and using their mass amount of power and Qi, they had slammed the leg.

It wasn't easy to pierce the large Amra's of this level, which superseded Sil a bit. He noticed that the flames that had covered her body had done next to nothing as well, but still, it was enough to knock her down.

Athos shot another arrow, trying to target the Sils without his ally. However, they all suddenly disappeared and teleported onto the female Amra's body, standing on her stomach.

"I can see every move you are going to make. There is a reason why the other gods could not kill me, and it will be the same."

The Sils spoke in unison as he lifted their hands in the air, and blue sparks of lightning started to form in their hands. Then, swinging it down, several lightning strikes hit the golden female Amra's body.

"If fire won't work, then I'll try lighting. And if that won't work, I'll just try something else that will!"

The strength of ten Sil clones using maximum illumination had just caused the entire area to light up to the point where no one could see anything, but the Sil who was at the center of it could see that it was still not affecting Amra's body.

"This isn't even the Celestial itself, and I have a bit tougher time than I usually would. So maybe I should take my chance, and instead of playing safe, I should go all out and figure out how to hurt her."

Sil avoided each arrow, teleporting again, and it looked like Athos was reluctant to move from his position. But, at least for now, he could see that Athos was using his Shield to block an attack from Quinn.

While teleporting everywhere, using his soul weapon Sil was searching for a power that he could use, and he had finally found one he believed would be of some use. Just then, the female Amra regained her composure and was about to stand up again.

After quickly teleporting from place to place, in areas where he knew Athos could not hit him, Sil finally appeared directly behind the female. Then, placing his hand against her back, he was about to phase into it.

It looked like his hands were slowly submerging into her back, and he suddenly disappeared from the spot again. In the next second, the female Amra coughed up blood and her face paled as fear gripped her heart.

Her eyes turned red, and she began feeling a strange sensation all over her body. She knew something was wrong, and after a moment of thought, she turned toward her god and opened her mouth to speak.

"It was an honour serving you, my dear God." These were her last words as flames erupted from inside out, spewing with blood from mouth and before burning her insides with flame. The same was happening to her eyeballs, which had burnt to a crisp as soon as the flames came out.

It was clear that the golden Amra female was dead. And with this, Sil had defeated one of the strongest warriors of the Amra race without much effort.

A few moments later, Sil appeared out from the top of her body, his arms covered in flames, and his whole body was sheathed in Amra blood.

His arms had evaporated off the access of their blood, turning it into steam, but the rest of him... there was nothing about Sil that made him look human.

"I can predict what you will do and where you will attack."

"I can clone myself to create more of me, and I have the strongest powers earth has to offer, but do you know what the worst thing about me is? It's the fact that I can always find a way."

"Through countless abilities at my disposal, I can always find a way to kill anyone in front of me."

"I knew you would be far more troublesome than the other one," Athos broke his silence, "Which is why I wanted him to get rid of you, but I guess I will just have to do it myself."

It was then that other Sils started to gather around him. There were eleven in total. The real Sil stood in the centre and lifted his hand, opening up a portal. A large trident dropped out of it, which Sil caught without trouble. He then spun it a few seconds before stopping its shiny reflective blue end into the body of the dead he was currently standing on.

The trident was clearly unique and was radiating with power. There was a crystal design at the bottom, while the handle went up like waves in a dark blue colour heading towards the top. Then at the very top, there were the three spikes.

All three were in different colour tips, blue, red, and almost transparent colour, while the base of the trident was still in a similar diamond-like pattern.

"You think a demon weapon will change the outcome of this fight?" Athos asked. "Compared to my celestial weapons, they are nothing"

Athos lifted up the mace and prepared his sword. Now that Quinn was gone, he could use all of his weapons toward the God slayer, and it looked like he was confident, but he wasn't the only one who was.

"I just wish Quinn was there. That way, he could have seen what I had in store for him." Sil said with a smile.

Just then, the ten clones of Sil standing around him lifted their arms as well. As they did, a portal appeared above them. And in the next instant, all sorts of weapons began to drop out.

One was Shield, another was a spear, one looked like a strange gun, and there were many others, all unique in their own way. However, there was one thing that all of these items had in common.

"You're right. One demon weapon won't make a difference. But with my powers and all these demon weapons I have gathered over the years. I think we stand a pretty good chance." Sil replied in conviction.

***

# Chapter 1801: Evolving Celestial.

Intense energy was emitting from Athos during the fight. It was so strong that it affected his surroundings. The ground was constantly quivering, and the smaller rubble would disappear altogether. In reality, they were breaking down into fine particles instead of condensing due to the power.

As a result, many were forced to get away from the fight. One of them was the other golden-coloured female Amra. She was tightly holding both swords and was constantly on the move, slashing through the rocks thrown at her.

"Hey, are we just going to keep tossing these rocks?" Nock asked while picking up anything he could find and hurling it as far as possible.

Even if they were to hit the Amra, the rocks would do nothing. It was as if a child was hurling a piece of dirt at an adult.

However, since there were three of them and each had four arms, these piles of dirt added up and were quite distracting.

"Do you suggest we fight this one head-on!" Dober replied, still picking up things from the ground.

All three were also stepping away from the fight to not get caught in the mess, and soon they had stepped out of the danger zone, and even the rubble around them had lessened. And now, their attacks slowed down a bit. However, the Female Amra was already annoyed enough by them.

She smacked the air with her two swords, releasing strange energy. Then, her swords began vibrating, and whenever the rocks came close, they would instantly get crushed falling to the ground before reaching her.

"How dare you embarrass me?!" the female shouted. "You haven't even climbed the tower. You haven't been through the things I have been through, and yet you dare to annoy me?"

Immediately, she dashed forward, covering the distance between them and her in an instant. Geo could see her blades swinging down. At that moment, he pushed Nock out of the way, and the sword went right between them. Hitting the ground, it sliced through, but it didn't cause the ground to be uplifted like an attack usually would.

Both of them had barely survived the deadly blow and were safe from the sword, but Dober noticed that Geo and Nock struggled to stand.

"This weight! It's like the other floors of the tower... what is that weapon!" Geo shouted.

Holding her sword in her other hand again, she was ready to slash it, to kill both of them in one hit.

"It's not the sword that is causing that. It's the power given to me by him!" She swung her sword, and Geo, at that moment, felt like this was going to be his end.

But just before it sliced him and his friend, a strange object coiled around the sword. It was red and black, with several glowing blades on it. Like a chain, it looped itself several times around the giant sword.

Suddenly the sword stopped. No matter how much force she applied, the sword would not budge.

"This strength..."

"Thank you for helping me out earlier. Now let me return the favour." A voice suddenly said from above.

The next moment, the female Amra felt an immense force pulling her sword. When she tried to pull back, nothing worked, and even though she applied her full strength, she only lost her grip and fell directly to the ground on her back as she lost her balance.

When she regained her composure and raised her head to see what had happened, she saw a small figure with black wings and glowing red armour above her. It was hard to tell it was the same person, but after a moment, she knew it was the same person from before-one of the two that had attacked.

"I wasn't planning to kill you, I wouldn't have if you didn't involve yourself, but I can't just let these people die," Quinn said.

The weapon from before was his soul weapon. The armour on his body was the hardened celestial blood that would be powered by his own blood. However, the strangest thing was that only one of the twin tail chains was currently in its chained form.

Meanwhile, the other one had transformed into a gauntlet that appeared on Quinn's other hand. His hand was in a claw-like shape as the fingertips on the gauntlet began turning bright red by the second. Then they started to elongate, and a claw made of red aura appeared slightly bigger covering the entire gauntlet.

Suddenly, Quinn started to move towards the female Amra on the ground, but it wasn't by his own will. Rather, he was being pulled forward.

With the single twin chain around the sword, Quinn was currently retracting the weapon back into itself and back into his body. Doing this was far faster than him running or at any flying speed as well.

Quinn had come down at an incredible speed, crashing into the hard Amra body with his claw hand as they ripped through any armour and hard skin she had. It was so swift and seemed effortless as if he was slicing his hand through a lake.

Blood gushed out immediately from the wound. Then, once his hand was in the body, he pushed it further in, and five lines of aura spread out from the gauntlet, ripping through her body and cutting it entirely from her stomach down to her legs.

When Quinn pulled out his hand, the female Amra was no longer alive. Retracting the claws, Quinn stood there and turned towards the other three.

Geo was on his backside, seeing Quinn hold his hand up as if he was in some victory pose and now seeing one of the greats of his race defeated so easily, he could only think one thing.

"Did we make the right choice... helping this man?" Because at that moment, honestly, he couldn't be sure.

[3420 Celestial points have been added]

When using his celestial soul weapon, he had just learned that attacking his opponent with it would also allow him to use the celestial drain ability and gain the celestial points from the dead. Staring at the prompt, Quinn knew Athos had invested quite a lot in the two around him.

"Thank you, and you have another use as well." Quinn said as he raised his hand, and the blood from Amra's body started to rise up, and then it began to swirl around Quinn like a tornado.

Eventually, going to his celestial gauntlet. A large amount of blood had come out from the giant Amra, and it had all disappeared like that. What Geo and the other two witnessed was clearly a feat that only a God could accomplish.

Flapping his wings, Quinn was off again, heading straight towards Athos. It didn't take him long, and he could see that the area where he was fighting once before had changed entirely.

There were enormous craters everywhere on the battlefield. The holes went so deep in some of them that lava had come out from below the crust, but it was easy to find where the two were fighting. One would just have to follow the energy.

That was when Quinn saw that Athos was somewhat fighting evenly with Sil. To be more specific, there were nine different Sil clones.

"Hey Quinn, this energy is making it hard to move. I could use a hand!" Sil shouted when he noticed Quinn while he swung his small sword, clashing against Athos large sword.

Then the two collided, and a large energy blast went above the sky, splitting the clouds and travelling far enough into space. The clash between Sil's weapons and all of Athos continued, and the shockwaves were going everywhere, destroying whatever they touched.

Just then, one energy blast went right past Quinn, causing almost a nuclear explosion in the background.

In all honesty, Quinn didn't know how much more the planet could take before it was destroyed. Placing both of his hands out, his gauntlet and the twin chain blade started to glow again, this time creating a completely new shape that he hadn't used before.

When the red glow faded, one could finally see what was in his hands.

"It's time to go back to my roots." Quinn said as he held two giant red Celestial blood scythes. The scythes were a dark red, almost black. Where it was curved near the edges, it was shrouded in glowing red energy.

***

# Chapter 1802: Tasty Blood.

Moments before Quinn had arrived, Sil had given ten of his clones the strongest pieces of equipment he had stored away with one of his abilities. He had gathered these weapons over the last few years while exploring the world, defeating Beasts and Gods.

Each of these weapons in the past would have caused wars to be fought over them, and in all honesty, Sil had never used them against a single person before. However, Sil noticed something after seeing Athos strikes.

This Celestial was different from the last one he had met. This one showed no fear while fighting and kept on counter attacking. He didn't even flinch or show reaction even after losing one of his strongest allies. There was something in Sil that was telling him he needed to do at least this much.

One of Sil's clones pointed its spear toward Athos, activating one of the skills, and it grew larger. Its head now looked almost the size of a cannon, and he was gathering a large amount of energy.

At the same time, Sil used the ability of foresight to predict where Athos would dodge. After that, he would follow up with the other clones, each using a weapon, and then finish Athos with his favourite weapon, the trident. Sil had planned every strike.

As predicted, just before the spear shot out its beam of energy, Athos stomped on the ground, and several cracks formed below his foot, looking like spider webs. Through these cracks, the white energy emitting from Giant Athos came out, and the cracks eventually reached Sil.

"I saw this in my vision, but it doesn't change anything!"

Sil stood at the perfect place and avoided all of the cracks. He knew where they would appear, and his first attack was ready to launch. However, just moments before his demon-tier spear fired, the light from the cracks rose.

At that moment, he suddenly felt a great weight on all his clones, It was so sudden and intense that all the Sils fell to the floor. Taking advantage of this, Athos had already shot an arrow, and it went right through the spear holder's head, killing the clone as the spear dropped on the group and the gathered energy dispersed.

"What just happened... my prediction... nothing like this happened in it." Sil thought.

Still, using his foresight powers, Sil started to teleport. Unfortunately, he couldn't move too easily because the gravity around him had suddenly increased a thousand fold. However, as soon as he and the others stepped out of the unknown range, the pressure on them disappeared.

"So this is the range? His celestial power most likely has something to do with gravity, but why didn't my foresight work?"

"Shouldn't it be able to reveal everything that is going to happen? Or maybe it's because it couldn't predict how the Celestial energy would affect me."

"It only knew how it normally would work. After all, what I see isn't truly the future." Sil thought.

Either way, Sil had second thoughts about using his foresight ability. It was the first time since using it with this much power and MC cells that it seemed to have failed him.

Instead of wasting his energy on the Foresight ability, he used all the different abilities and powers at his disposal and fired them toward Athos. Lightning, fire, wind, water, and earth were at their strongest levels. While using these attacks, all of the Sils charged toward him, including the one with the trident.

Seeing this, Athos lifted his large shield, which suddenly started to glow. When it did, all of Sil's long-distance attacks changed the trajectory, and instead of hitting them, they slammed into the shield. And when they hit the shield, they dealt zero damage. There was not even a tiny scratch.

"Deal with this!" Sil threw his trident, and it started to multiply when it left his hand. One Became ten, ten became a hundred, and a hundred became a thousand. Unlike before, the shield didn't seem to work on the weapon.

Seeing this, Athos once again stomped on the group, and the ground began to shine. And just when the tridents were about to hit Athos, they all began to fall as if something was pulling them.

However, the other Sils, with their weapons, were able to reach Athos.

They used their powers and weapons as best as possible and clashed against Athos. Sil knew he would lose out in a battle of strength as his clones were kicked to the side and crushed on the ground, but at times, an attack or two would get in and hit Athos back.

At the same time, Sil was looking for the right opportunity. The trident had reappeared in his hand as it was one of its abilities. It could come back to him no matter where it was.

He would throw the blade when he saw the chance, trying to cause a fatal blow. However, every time an attack came close, Athos would use a weapon or his shield to block the attack. And whenever he was overwhelmed, he used his Celestial powers to increase the gravity around him, causing everything to fall to the ground.

"Right now, neither of us have the upper hand, but there was a reason I didn't create multiple clones of myself... my MC cells."

"This fight has already gone on for much longer than I thought. I assumed he might tire out, but this man has a warrior's spirit. It feels like he'll keep fighting like this until his last breath!"

Just then, he caught a glimpse of Quinn flying toward him. As soon as the latter reached within carshot, Sil yelled out for him to help. He was getting frustrated, but rather than waiting for an opportunity to strike with his trident, this time, he was going on his own to create a chance for himself.

He could see one of the large hands with a sword coming his way. Sil pushed himself up with his great wind powers and then used the fire ability on his arm to thrust himself towards the incoming attack, and in the next instant, he quickly switched to a strength ability.

The trident and the sword collided, but they remained mid-air, as both powers appeared somewhat equal.

"I'll give you a hand with that!" A voice resounded, and a red curved object appeared from beneath, hitting the bottom of the sword and chucking it up somewhat. Sil could see Quinn flying through the air with his two red blood scythes in his hand.

Quinn had already swung his hand, throwing the Celestial soul weapon scythe towards Athos, and the latter moved his shield to block the attack. As the red scythe clashed against the shield, it looked like the latter had blocked the attack well, but something strange happened.

As the scythe made contact with the shield, it looked like blood was oozing out of the end of the bladed part. It quickly spread around the whole shield like some type of plague, and going around the shield, it branched out, heading straight towards Athos. Using his other hand and a mace, he had managed to cut it before the strange red blood looking veins reached his neck.

At that moment, Quinn landed on the ground and swung both of his scythes into the floor, and the same thing happened. Two spots of blood marks started forming, and they quickly went across the ground in spider-web shape before shooting up and sticking directly into Athosa's legs.

They had pierced and caused great pain to run through his body. Athos jumped up, and the blood web broke off again. However, from the very beginning of this battle, Athos was wounded for the first time.

Quinn started to swing his two scythes in circles spinning them. The blood that looked like hard ice icicles began to melt turning into a more standard blood consistency heading straight toward Quinn. Getting close the blood jumped onto the scythes, and as it was absorbed the energy was passed through, and into Quinn.

[Celestial blood has been consumed]

[Your Celestial powers have increased by 10 percent]

[Resistance against celestial power from Athos has been applied]

Upon seeing this, a smile appeared on Quinn's face, and he raised his head to stare at Athos.

"Your blood... it's quite tasty."

***

# Chapter 1803: Battle for home. (Part 1)

The system message was a surprise for Quinn. This prompt made him feel that there was still a lot for him to learn about his Celestial self. He knew this due to him currently being in the lower levels of a celestial that there would be more things to learn, but this message made him realise that even more.

The change in soul weapon was quite handy as he could control his celestial blood and his blood aura in more menacing ways compared to when he just used his standard blood control. The scythes he used could expand the size of the handle and the blade while they would emit a red blood aura from their ends.

On top of that, Quinn noticed that not only could he use his blood, but just like before when using his Soul weapon, the addition of others blood helped him become more versatile when using his blood moves.

"The system hasn't come up much since I've turned." Quinn thought.

"But then again, maybe it's because I have changed and was going up against those that weren't like me. Now, things are different." Quinn said, tightening his grip on both of his weapons.

"Well, it looks like you one upped me for once," Sil said, gathering the rest of his clones and creating one more as he quickly whipped out his book to change his ability.

The new clone had also picked up the spear, and now ten Sils with ten demon-tier weapons had lined up. "You got him to jump back... you scared him, which is a first."

Looking at Sil, Quinn couldn't believe what he was seeing. He knew Sil had a few weapons up his sleeve he had yet to use during their fight but to think the latter had so many weapons. Although it wasn't working so well against Athos, perhaps because of the giants own set of weapons and limbs. It did make Quinn wonder how well he would do against Sil.

Sil had been fighting Athos alone this whole time and could barely survive. On the other hand, Quinn had only caught Athos by surprise due to his attention on Sil.

"It's not a contest," Quinn replied. "Besides... without blood, I can't use these for long."

[HP: 64/100]

Very rarely did Quinn have to keep an eye on his HP these days. There were a few reasons for that. One of them was that blood attacks didn't affect his health anymore, but the Celestial energy was a different story due to it being trapped in his body.

Quinn had only figured out how to use it by literally making cuts on himself and drawing his own blood out. The soul weapons he was using acted a little differently, but eventually, they would also drain his HP.

"It's the same for me, my friend. The longer this fight draws out, the worse it is." Sil replied, thinking about his MC cells. Once his MC cells ran out, he would be helpless against Athos, and this was what they had to prevent.

With these thoughts in their minds, it was time for them to charge forward. Quinn ran across the ground, stomping his feet on the surface and using his blood control to control the hardened armour around him, which allowed him to move faster.

On the other hand, Sil was teleporting all over the place, putting his trust in the foresight ability once again.

This allowed him to dodge all the incoming attacks.

Athos was getting frustrated. stomping his foot, he created several cracks in the ground again, and the white light came out from these cracks. Knowing what this would do, Sil teleported all of his clones directly to where Athos was.

"I'll hit you before you can use that crap on me!" Sil shouted as three of the Sils struck with the sword on Athos sides using flames and their demon-tier weapons. It imbalanced Athos, and at that moment, Sil was able to thrust his trident forward.

As he did, a stream of water appeared through the air, suddenly giving Sil a boost as he struck the trident deep into the giant's shoulder. A successful hit had landed on Athos, but it was due to him now being distracted by another as well.

*** *** ***

The white light from the ground had hit Quinn, and he could feel it somewhat affect him, but thanks to the blood he had consumed, Quinn was in a slightly better state.

Just when he was about to swing his scythes, he saw Athos was getting his shield ready, and that's when he decided to modify the attack plan.

Then, without any hesitation, he swung the scythes. However, mid-swing, they started to glow red as their form changed to the twin blade chain. Their pointy ends stuck into the shield, creating a small dent. Then using their ability to retract, Quinn pulled himself and flew towards Athos.

Seeing this, Athos, with his other hand, had his spear ready, its tip glowing like before, and using his strength, he it out, perfectly aiming for Quinn, but the latter was ready this time.

"That was what I was waiting for."

[Shadow Overload skill activated]

Quinn had his demon tier chest piece on, and the wings sprouted in the back were wrapped by shadows. As for his legs, they were covered in his red blood celestial armour, and the twin tail chains were held tightly in his arms.

The shadow overload skill would usually shroud Quinn's body with a shadow body upon activation.

As expected, when he activated the shadow overload, the Shadow enveloped his skin, but strangely, it went underneath the celestial armour, and one could even see the twin tails through the Shadow.

As the Shadow clad his body, Quinn looked less and less like a human, but he wasn't bothered by this fact.

Just then, as Athos' spear was about to hit him, he surrounded himself in his wings and deflected the attack.

The spear's tip was so large that it nearly covered an entire wing, but at that moment, something strange happened. The spear went through the wing, but instead of hitting Quinn, it suddenly came out the other wing and was heading straight back towards Athos.

"Becoming a Celestial, and using my skills with this demon-tier equipment, a lot of things have changed."

"I have found that the Shadow Overload skill and the demon-tier armour's active skills meant that I won't lose MC points as long as the Shadow is on my wings."

"It acts like a condensed form of the shadow, but I can use its other traits just like I usually would when having the shadow overload skill."

With the spear coming out from Quinn's other wing like a portal, it headed straight for the shield and crashed into it. The shield didn't break, but the momentum had pushed back Athos, but just then, along with Sil's trident hitting his shoulders, the force caused him to lose balance as one of his feet rose, and he fell on his back.

Without wasting time, Quinn summoned several shadow portals over Athos position, and he then swung his two twin blades, creating countless blood slashes. As they went through the shadow, they began hitting Athos body.

At the same time, in the air, Sil had raised himself onto a pillar of earth and threw down his trident. It started to multiply and hit Athos on the ground. With each attack, Athos body sank deeper, and the two didn't stop until they heard an almighty roar.

"ARGHH!" Athos, now enraged, leapt up from the ground, and the whole world seemed to react at that point. It shook from the force and aftershock when he landed in a different area from where the two were attacking. It felt like the target they were on had moved slightly as they felt a strange feeling in their stomach. It was as if the planet itself had moved.

Athos stood there in anger, huffing and panting, and had blood wounds all over his body from the attack.

He was hurt, but it looked like he was nowhere near his end and could still fight on.

[HP: 44/100]

"I have already used my blood bank... so how much time do I have left? It's definitely not much, so I must end this fight as fast as I can."

Thinking of this, Quinn decided to change his weapons to the blood scythes once again. It was his weapon's strongest form and made it easier to drain blood from his opponent.

"Sil... we have to stop him from moving, use whatever you can... then we will attack him with all we got, and I meant it."

"We must use everything at our disposal. I am sure that we can take him down." He said.

"Oh... so you're saying you would have lost to him without me here? Well, I have to admit, I feel the same way."

"One hit from this guy, and I feel like I would have died. I would have been out of this fight if it weren't for you. Also, I have a feeling someone is watching us up there." Sil joked.

"Up there? Haha." Quinn smiled, thinking of the Celestial space. "You're right. Someone is watching us from up there, but we decide our own fate. Come, let's finish this so we can finally get back home."

***

# Chapter 1804: Battle for home. (Part 2)

Inside the Celestial space, none of the Celestials were chatting as they stared at the orb in the centre and closely observed the ongoing battle. Many wondered if they could survive or how long they could last if they faced these two.

The strength of this duo was certainly impressive, and it looked like the planet was already done for. They had tossed around too much energy for the planet to bear, and it was already on the verge of destruction.

"Athos will win, right?" One of the celestials asked.

"Look at his strength, and even after those attacks, he barely has a scratch on him. Not to mention, he has plenty of Celestial energy still to use as well!"

Although he was betting on Athos, his nervous tone betrayed his thoughts.

"You know, the Celestial energy isn't everything. It allows us to do things that others could never imagine, but it doesn't mean we will win all of our battles."

"We can use only so much celestial energy in a fight, and it seems like the other Celestial is a Strong fighter along with the God Slaver. These two are a deadly duo."

Biting her nails, Bliss continued to watch because she honestly wasn't sure which side she wanted to win. Although Quinn was causing trouble for Earth, where she thrived and originally came from, she wondered if she was delaying the inevitable.

The other celestials and ancient ones had been trying to claim Earth for themselves for the longest time due to the abundance of life in and around the solar system. As for who would win this fight, it was too close to call.

However, according to Bliss calculations, Sil and Quinn were already at the edge of exhaustion.

*** *** ***

Bliss was right. The exhaustion was why Quinn decided to gamble everything on this next attack. He had no more cards to play. So all he could do was try to win with his strength.

"Remember what I said, Sil. I trust you!" Quinn shouted, running forward.

He held the scythes by the bottom of the handle and changed the shape slightly to create a small loop at the end. Then, putting his finger through it, Quinn started to spin it while still holding the other one steady.

His wings allowed him to fly slightly in the air to ensure the part of the scythe didn't touch the ground, and in the next instant, Quinn flew forward. After spinning the scythe to a degree, Quinn gathered his normal blood aura rather than his Celestial one and began swinging the scythe swiftly.

As he did, a large tornado of blood came from the scythe. It ran across the ground, destroying everything it touched and anything that would come close to it, heading straight for Athos.

After a moment, Quinn swung the other scythe and did the same, and now there were two large tornados of blood heading straight for the giant. They had started small but had grown just as large as Athos himself. Seeing this, Athos grabbed his mace and his sword and swung them both down directly at the attack, destroying it and making it dissipate.

As soon as his sword had sliced through the blood tornado though, a large energy blast hit Athos on his shoulder, compelling him to grunt in pain as he noticed that it was the other one with his clones and demon-tier weapons. The one holding the spear looked like he could finally use his weapon in an attack.

"Taking on two of these is harder than I thought it would be... I need to get my act together!" Athos tried to concentrate.

As more Blood tornadoes came toward Athos, shadows appeared with different blood attacks on him. Seeing this, Athos started to spin his whole body and, while doing so, used all of the weapons he could to attack and block the attacks.

Mainly, Sil made the stronger aggressive attacks as his demon-tier weapons went to work. It was taking nearly everything for Athos to stop himself from receiving a vital blow. Once again, it looked like Sil was able to gather Athos full attention, as his ten clones had gotten in an equal distance around Athos, and all of them were attacking with various weapons and abilities.

Seeing this, Quinn thought it was time for him to act. So he continued to swing the large scythes, and now they were growing in size. They got larger by the second, and Quinn even started having trouble controlling the energy and supplying his blood to it.

[16/100 HP]

"That's it, if this attack hits, we'll win this fight!"

Quinn was flapping his wings once in a while so he would remain around chest height compared to the giant. His scythes spun and the range of the blade was now as large as the giant god himself.

For the first time, Quinn felt there was a strain on his body, holding the large celestial weapons. In fact, after reaching the 50 Health-Points mark, he realised it long ago. It was almost as if his body wasn't special anymore since most of his blood was out of his body.

"It looks like Quinn's ready." Sil thought.

At that moment, using the teleportation ability and his foresight, Sil had teleported each one of his lines into a certain position. Instantly they all put their hands on the ground, and out of it, a solid large Ice pillar appeared.

They were giant in size, solid and thick. The pillars didn't just come straight up out of the ground as if they were trying to hit the clouds. They had come out at all sorts of angles, going through Athos legs, going through his arms, and crossing each other narrowly, as ice touched ice.

Eventually the ten pillars, and went through all of Athos' limbs, and were also crossing over in such a way that four pillars had trapped his head as well.

"This is it, Quinn, I'm out of MC, and I don't know how long this will hold him for, but I can still use my weapons."

All of the clones of Sil started to charge up their weapons as they were ready for one last attack.

At the same time, seeing Athos trapped, Quinn Swung both of his giant scythes from side to side, straight for Athos head planning to chop it right off. Athos could see his death coming before his eyes.

He was no fool to think that the scythes wouldn't slice his head clean off. So he gathered his energy, his strength and power to fight out of the Ice pillars. As he did, they began to crack, but they were solid and strong, and the attacks coming from Sil were making it hard for him to charge up his energy.

"ARGHHH!" Athos screamed and lit up in a white glow. The ice pillars were destroyed breaking and falling to the ground, but the scythes had already been swung.

As he leant back, Athos followed with his eyes the tip of both of the scythes and saw them cut through the hard skin around his neck. Instantly blood started to squirt out and Athos was falling to the ground.

With two of his arms, he held his neck, but the colour in his eyes was fading, and he finally crashed on the ground.

As he fell, the white energy started to fade around him, and that's when both Sil and Quinn knew it was the end of the fight.

Still a little concerned, Quinn was in his current form as he flew to Athos' head, where one of Sil's clones was standing as well. The two of them looked at his giant eyes slowly losing life.

"We just wanted you to take us back to earth..it didn't have to end this way," Quinn said. "It still doesn't. We can find a way to help you, just agree to take us back."

Athos' pupil moved to look at Quinn, but in the end, he said nothing.

"You said you were a good guy, so why are you stopping us?" Quinn shouted in frustration.

Finally, Athos moved his lips.

"You're meant to be on our side." He said with heavy breaths in between.

Seeing Athos still breathing like this, and not giving up, Quinn felt like he had no option.

"My friends are more important than any of this celestial crap," Quinn replied without hesitation.

"If you won't help us get back to the Earth... then I have no choice." Quinn moved over and placed his hand on his head.

[Skill Celestial drain has been activated]

[Athos Celestial Energy points will be added to your]

***

# Chapter 1805: Uproar in another world.

The celestial drain was a skill Quinn had only used once before and never on another celestial. It was his first time and seeing how Athos was on his deathbed and with no one to help him. It was the perfect opportunity to use it.

"I don't really know how this celestial drain works. Do I get all of his celestial points? I don't think that would be the case because gods are meant to reincarnate."

"If I remember correctly, the system stated I would get his Celestial points, and when he reincarnated, the celestial points I gained would return to him."

"But how long... until he reincarnates." Quinn thought.

Either way, it would be a power boost for Quinn, even if it was temporary. It wasn't his primary objective in the first place. They had somewhat failed their primary objective because they now had no way of getting home.

Quinn's hand pressed Athos' head, and the white energy rushed through him. It wasn't a painful feeling. Rather it was quite pleasant, more pleasant than anything feeling he could even describe.

It was as if someone had been deprived of sugar for most of their life to have their first ever ice cream. It was truly magnificent, which was why Quinn also thought it was dangerous.

*** *** ***

Inside the celestial space now, the fight had come to an end; there were a few comments here and there about what had occurred.

"The infamous god Slayer still lives, and it seems like he has killed quite a skilled Celestial for the first time. Should we spread the news?" One of them asked.

"This is the type of news that is impossible to keep just to ourselves!" Xox almost shouted in excitement, and his ball body was quite sweaty at the moment.

"Too many people have witnessed the event, and you know it's impossible to tell a celestial what to do... it will just cause arguments."

"Well, what I want to know is who that other celestial is that is helping him. If they are celestial, they can enter this space."

"If that's the case with the two of them, they could plan to get rid of a large amount of us. I suggest that this matter has to be reported to the ancient ones!"

The others around the man nodded in agreement. They were quite fearful of what they had seen for more reasons than one.

"I'm sorry, but I'm quite new here!" A short celestial said, raising their hand, they were about half the size of a normal human but had a similar shape with a pair of forceps in their head, or at least that's what the outline of energy looked like. "Is it really a big problem?"

"Athos was a strong Celestial so he should reincarnate and have plenty of followers. So, as long as the two of them don't suddenly start killing us all, will it be a problem?"

Since they were a new celestial, they themselves had never experienced reincarnation. However, there were times when even celestials would die from those that weren't even God Slayers.

"It is a problem because Athos might not be able to come back," Xox explained.

"As you said, a Celestial can reincarnate as long as they have a follower, All of Athos' dedicated followers were killed by the two we watched."

"On top of that, the celestial drained his energy away. When draining energy, there is a chance that too much is taken, and it lowers our celestial powers to the point where we can't reincarnate."

"Even if that's not the case, reincarnation has many problems in itself."

"For one, the time it takes to reincarnate. What if a god reappears after 1000 years. If that were to occur, by that time, there might not be a single being alive that can remember Athos."

"If that's the case he is no longer a celestial and, therefore can no longer reincarnate. Then there are the cases where one has been reincarnated but lost their memories, another where only their soul and powers have been put in another being."

Now hearing it from Xox, the new celestial really knew how dangerous it was. He thought due to the reincarnation that they didn't have to worry, but with another celestial there and killing the god slayer. There was more of a chance that Athos would never come back alive again.

"Then doesn't that mean we should report this to the ancient ones or the stronger celestials? Maybe they can come up with a plan to take these two out!" Another replied.

"Wait!" A voice shouted out to the relatively large group. "There's no need to do that." As for the one they could see speaking, it was none other than Bliss.

"Rember, that Immortui is part of the other realm that controls earth. If there is ever a large or serious problem, he will deal with it."

"Even if he has to personally in some way. This is just a small hiccup in the 1000s of years to come."

"Besides, you all know that if celestials were to come to Earth, it would attract all types of different Celestials trying to go there for their own purpose. These actions could cause infighting between us and in turn upset the balance!"

It was a plea, and many of them knew that. They knew who the god was in front of them. A fairly old one that had been doing things for a fairly long time, but it wasn't her they were afraid of.

"Wait, the celestial and god slayer, don't they both come from Earth? They both have a similar form, and if they're fighting together, they most likely know each other!"

"How can you not keep a celestial from Earth in check, Bliss! Or maybe you are working with them!" Another shouted.

"Hey, wait a second, didn't that B guy say he came from Earth as well. Yeah... the new celestial. You don't think that was him we saw fighting right now."

The talking between the celestials was getting larger, and it seemed like Bliss's intervention had stirred up more conversation, only making their determination stronger to inform others about what was going on.

"What do I do now... do I inform Quinn...do I send him back... but if there is an attack on Earth from other Celestials, then we will need to prepare, Quinn will have to get as strong as possible."

Bliss let out a big sigh as she suddenly disappeared out of the space.

Her interventions and her ability to see what would occur usually gave her issues. It just had given her major issues this time.

*** *** ***

Back on the planet that continued to shake and rumble all over, Quinn had finished using his celestial drain. Athos's body was now slowly disappearing, turning into particles, and as he did, so did his other two dedicated followers.

"Come on, Quinn, I let you do your magic thing, but we have to get off this place now!" Sil shouted. Using his powers, a large spaceship was brought out from a portal.

Seeing this, the other three Amra that were not too far off were seen running towards Quinn and the others. Based on what he had seen, Sil knew these guys were friendly. After letting everyone on board the spaceship. It quickly blasted off, heading out of the planet's gravity pull and into space.

A few moments later, and looking back, they all could see the planet explode right in front of them. A large force could be felt dragging the spaceship in slightly after the explosion, but the ship, using extra power, had blasted off heading out.

"You mean... we would have died if we stayed there," Nock commented.

It was a close call, but to Quinn, who was staring off into space, it didn't seem to be a reaction at all to the planet exploding. Instead, he was staring at nothing but the air in front of him.

[28 546/252 256 Celestial energy]

[You are now Level: 4]

[Congratulations, you have received enough Celestial energy to level up]

[You are now Level: 5]

[The following skills have been obtained]

***

# Chapter 1806: Share power.

The number of Celestial points was beyond what Quinn could think of, even though he knew Athos had an abundant amount of it. For instance, the latter created these large towers that had their own world within them.

Every time Quinn absorbed the nest crystals with the Celestial marking, he could tell that Athos put a large amount of celestial energy into them. However, after only completing his condition somewhat with many of those on Earth, he didn't expect much.

"How many years were you storing this for? Getting those to complete your condition... and you gave it all up for what?" Quinn didn't quite understand Athos reason for fighting against him. Maybe he was arrogant, or he just wanted to start afresh, or perhaps he had even grown tired of this whole thing.

Currently, Quinn was in the spaceship, and they were heading back to the Planet where Athos originally resided. Dober was helping Sil navigate between the parents to find out which one was the right one.

Dober was always interested in these particular things, even in the tower, which was why he had so much knowledge, even about creating vessels that could travel in space. Although, after finding Sil, they no longer needed a ship, they just needed to know the directions.

Now that Quinn and Sil had defeated Athos, they couldn't help but wonder what would happen to the tower and how the people would react to this event. At the same time, Geo and the others tried to forget about the planet they had destroyed.

Although Geo didn't know any of them personally, he seemed somewhat upset that all of the Amra, those of the same race as him, had died on that planet and could have been partially due to them.

All three of the Amra were in disbelief of what had occurred. Their God that they had never seen until today was suddenly defeated like that... and killed. It was a tale that they would find hard to believe if someone was to tell them.

When everyone was quiet on the ship and lost in their own thoughts, Quinn used the time to understand and see the new changes after levelling up. First, he wanted to know what he had achieved through levelling up, as there was a new celestial power with each level.

[Reincarnation has been unlocked for the Celestial "Quinn Talen"]

[Reincarnation will ensue upon your death. Death, natural or not, will incur a loss of celestial points, and this ability will use a certain number of Celestial points to activate]

[The time and the state of Reincarnation are unknown. Now that Reincarnation has been unlocked, it has been added permanently to the Celestial]

[Condition to activate: As long as there is one dedicated follower of the celestial or someone who remembers the Celestial and is still alive. (Apart from other celestials), Reincarnation will be possible]

"I've unlocked Reincarnation... now I really am becoming more and more like them, but it's... harder than I thought." Quinn thought as he realised that even though they could reincarnate, death for a god wasn't always a safe bet.

Although he didn't know why, perhaps it was because he was reading it on a system screen, but the information just seemed lacklustre. For such a special ability which could theoretically make someone immortal in a way, it just didn't feel real to Quinn.

Especially since there were no power boosts like when he previously levelled up, just more skills he could use.

[You can now create a personal space]

[A Personal space is an independent space that celestials can create using their celestial energy. The amount of celestial energy consumed will depend on the size and stability of the space]

[The space created by a celestial will be fully under their control. And they can control the flow of time depending on the amount of Celestial energy available to consume]

Upon reading the second skill he had unlocked, Quinn pondered two things. One of them being about the Celestial space that he could already access. It sounded similar to that.

Does that mean the whole giant space was created by someone else? Maybe by a real god or something? or Is it just the universe acting like what that damned Bliss blabbers about all the time.

As for the second thought, it was to do with Bliss. The space she had created before she had taken Quinn away from everyone.

"I would like to test my personal space skill and see how it works." Quinn thought.

"But now probably isn't the best time. With this many Celestial points, I can start experimenting with more weapons and markings."

This was something Quinn was looking forward to most. After fighting against Sil, he realised that there might be opponents in the future that his set of skills might not give the outcome he wants, but with weapons, he could make his arsenal much more versatile.

It was a close call in the fight against Athos. Without Sil's help, Quinn would have most likely lost the battle.

Thinking about this, he remembered there was something else he needed to do as well.

He then stood up and walked over to the table where Nock and Geo were seated. Then, moving the chair, he sat across them and placed his hands on the table.

"I first want to apologise," Quinn said. "I never meant to kill your God, your Celestial. I know you guys looked up to him. And honestly, I just wanted to leave this place and return home."

"But unfortunately, the two of us were in a tricky situation, and for some reason that I am unaware of, Athos was trying to kill us. If we didn't go all out, it would have been the end of us."

The two were silent for a while. In the end, Geo was the one that replied first.

"You saved us. I admit this wasn't what I expected, but our God was using us as a way to... force you to act. We saw that."

"Your dispute and reasons are probably beyond what we can understand. I am just worried for my people and my race now that he is gone."

"That is actually what I wanted to talk to you about," Quinn replied.

"I gained a lot of energy after defeating Athos, and I... don't know how much it will help, but I would like to pass this on to you. In fact, to all of you three."

"I think you will be able to use it well to defeat enemies, help your people or create order in the race, which will soon become chaotic without Athos."

The others didn't understand what Quinn was saying, so he decided to show them when he returned. In the first place, he wasn't even sure how much Celestial energy they could hold.

Quinn took a while to explain what he was going to do and what might happen to them. He also explained how this would link them to him, and if Quinn were to die, they would also. However, instead of hesitating, all three of them were over the moon after hearing everything and were willing to give it a try.

"Well, that's a surprise, but I'm happy for you all," Quinn said. "When we get to your planet, we will first gauge the situation, and then we will decide on the next step."

"What about your people Quinn?" Geo said.

"I want to thank you for everything you have done, and I want to say that in the future, lthough we can't help, you know, if there is ever anything you need help with... you can contact us."

It was a good gesture, and Quinn shook Geo's all four hands at once to take his word on it if the time would come. It looked like he had made a good ally on this short trip.

Just then, as they were approaching the planet, Quinn received a message from his system.

[You have received a message from Celestial "Bliss"]

[Would you like to read?]

"Hm? What is she trying to do?" Quinn thought.

***

# Chapter 1807: Celestial trouble.

When Quinn entered the Celestial Space for the first time, he had learned about the message function. Opening up the system at that time, there was a long list of names to those he could send messages to, but he couldn't send any because his Celestial level was too low then.

Also, there was another issue. Nearly everyone was under an alias, so he had no idea who they were, not to mention he didn't know any of them either since the only Celestial he could think of was Bliss herself. At the same time, the Celestial Section of the System could only be accessed when one was in the Celestial Space, which meant that Bliss was in there at this moment.

"After teleporting me out here in the middle of nowhere, she is finally reaching out to me." Quinn thought as his clenched fist slightly trembled. Although he couldn't imagine what had gone on while he was away, there was only one plus side to it: he was now with Sil.

"I really want to just ignore this message, but at the moment, after we drop off Geo and the others, we have nowhere to go from here... and I am curious about what she wants."

In the end, Quinn reluctantly clicked to open the message, and he was pretty surprised upon reading the message in the prompt in front of him.

[This message is paramount for you and the whole human race. I know we got off on the wrong foot, and you most likely hate me for things I have done, but everything I did is for the human race and its survival, so please do not ignore this.]

No introduction, no sweet hello, as expected from someone like her. Quinn continued to read.

[Your fight with Athos has gained great attention in the Celestial Space. Don't return to the Celestial Space if you want to avoid trouble and help the Earth and everyone on it.]

The message said nothing more, and there wasn't much for Quinn to go by.

"They know about my fight against Athos, but how? How were they even able to watch us fight?"

"Do they have screens in there or something? I didn't see people doing that before when I was there. Then again, I was focused on my own goals and didn't bother about anything else." Quinn thought.

"But is she even telling the truth? Since my level has increased, I originally wanted to head to Celestial Space to see what else I could do."

"I thought I could walk to one of the white energies and transport myself to their Space. But then there's Sil as well. Still, there might be some information there that can help us get back to Earth."

"And how did she know this was me? I didn't use my real name. I just used an alias, B."

There were many things that weren't adding up to Quinn because he was unaware of what was going on in the Space while they were fighting against Athos. But, either way, there was one thing Quinn was sure аbout: Bliss was currently in the Celestial Space.

"Everyone, I will be meditating for some time. In fact, I don't know how long it will take for me to get back, hopefully not too long." Quinn said while crossing his legs to sit on the floor of all things and then closed his eyes.

"Hey... um, was he always like this?" Sil asked. "I mean like he seems a little weird."

Just then, Quinn opened his eyes and fell to the floor like he was in extreme pain. Sil rushed to his side, and when he held Quinn, he noticed the latter was extremely sweaty.

"Quinn, Quinn!" He shouted. "What happened?"

Quinn slowly controlled his breathing and held his chest as he looked at Sil.

"I think... I just died." Quinn replied.

*** *** ***

A moment ago, after Quinn had closed his eyes, he had entered Celestial Space, and in doing so, a couple of message prompts from the Space system greeted him.

[Due to the increase in your level, certain features have now been unlocked]

[Ability to send messages has been unlocked]

[Ability to travel in Celestial Space has been unlocked]

"This is great, just like I thought. Since Bliss sent me a message, I should be able to send her one now as well. Although, what do I send? I might just scare her away. So maybe it's best if I just look for her first."

"If I remember what that floating ball said, once I know who is who, then I just need to remember the feeling of their energy and then each time I come here, I'll be able to find her. So I just need to run into her once.

With that, Quinn was on his journey, and almost immediately, he noticed a significant distinction in himself compared to the last time he was in Space.

While in Space, one only appeared as a pure form of their celestial energy and no distinctive features could be seen beside their outline.

This time though, his energy form was radiating with power. It had even grown quite a bit compared to before, and the change was quite apparent. "I can tell a bit more now that my level has increased. After fighting Athos, I have a rough idea of everyone's celestial energy and how strong they are." Quinn said, looking around at the others.

While walking in the Space, Quinn was mainly looking for those with a human-like figure since he could rule out all of the celestials that didn't. However, he quickly latched on to the idea that something strange was happening.

As he walked past certain white balls of energy, some of them would whisper and glance at him.

"I don't like this, I thought I was safe because of my alias, but it looks like something has happened. Bliss is right"

Just then, Quinn spotted a familiar energy ball he met last time. The ball of energy known as Xox also noticed him and came to a stop. After a moment of silence between the two, Xox instantly turned away before starting to dash, but Quinn was much faster and sprinting across the floor, he soon jumped in front of the latter.

"It's nice to meet you again. Do you mind explaining why everyone is looking at me a little... strange?" Quinn asked.

Xox turned left, but Quinn quickly got in front of him. He turned right, and Quinn stopped him once again, and finally, he grabbed the ball with his hands.

"I don't really know if there are rules against any infighting here or what happens if someone hurts others, but I don't mind testing it out to find out," Quinn said while clenching his fist, ready to punch the ball.

"Wait, okay, okay, let me explain, but can we get away from the others?" Xox whispered while looking around.

They soon arrived at the sparse part of the Space, which was a lot in there. Xox looked around before speaking to Quinn,

"Look, you have to get out of here, B!" Xox said. "The Celestials have all figured out that you were the one that took out Athos."

"A certain group is after you, and if they see you or anyone else talking to you, they will do everything in their power to get rid of you and the person talking to you!"

"Wait, slow down. What do you mean? How did they figure out I'm me?" Quinn asked.

"Don't you remember you were the one that told us you were from Earth?! There aren't many Celestials from Earth, and many witnessed the match between the God Slayer and Athos."

"Seeing a celestial there who helped the God Slayer and then because God Slayer is from the Earth, it doesn't take a genius to figure out who you are."

"People remembered you from the last time because you were doing strange things in here!" Xox's tone showed his nervousness as he continued to look around to keep an eye out for himself.

Just then, Xox noticed something and decided to run off before Quinn could say anything else.

"Wait, I'm not done yet... help me find Bliss... I need to find her. You said you know everyone's image readings, right?!" Quinn shouted.

Turning around while floating backwards, Xox only had a few words to say.

"Remember our deal from last time. I have nothing to do with you, remember that! So don't drag me into the dirt with you."

Hearing this, Quinn frowned, and after a moment of thought, he turned around.

And when he did, he finally knew why Xox had suddenly run off like that because now about twenty Celestials were standing in front of him, all with different shapes and sizes with varying amounts of celestial energy.

"B!" One of them shouted. "You teamed up with a God Slayer. We all saw it, so don't you dare deny it."

"You even killed one of us, which is why we have decided collectively as a group that you are not welcome in this space anymore."

"We will spread the word and continue to spread it far and wide that Celestial B from Earth is no longer allowed here, and if anyone is to see him, they are to get rid of him by force!"

***

# Chapter 1808: B Rampage.

Quinn did not need to be told twice. It was clear he wasn't welcome in this place. However, their actions spoke louder than words as they inched slowly towards him.

"Wait, guys, let's be civil here. I can explain everything. I wanted to return to Earth, but Athos wouldn't send me there. Why can no one understand that?" Quinn said, stepping back.

The other Celestials didn't seem to care about what Quinn had to say, as none of them reacted and kept coming closer. This only annoyed him more about the entire situation. One option was available to him though, and that was to exit the Celestial Space as asked.

However, Quinn thought about it for a moment, and instead of taking a step back, he looked forward toward them.

"Since none of you is willing to listen to me. I will consider that you guys have already determined that I'm your enemy," Quinn said, clenching his fist.

"I never liked you guys anyway, but as I have with everyone in the past, I'll give you a chance."

"I just want to find Bliss. If you tell me where she is, I'll be out of your way, but if you get in my way..." Before he could finish his words, the Celestial at the front had already arrived in front of Quinn. It looked like a giant beetle due to its outline and even had two large forceps, tentacles or whatever they were. As he charged toward Quinn, the latter lifted his hands and grabbed them before they could reach him.

"I can only use my Celestial powers here... so I'm a bit weaker, but I will have the advantage when it comes to hand-to-hand combat." Quinn thought as he kicked the beetle in the chest. It had knocked the latter away, and particles dispersed into the space.

Before the beetle could recover, Quinn stepped in with his fast speed and sent an elbow straight towards the former's chest, hitting him in the same spot again. It was a decisive blow that would have sent the Celestial flying if it wasn't for Quinn, who had lifted his leg before that could happen, stopping him with his foot.

Dragging his opponent towards him with his foot, Quinn slammed his opponent's face into the ground before stomping on top of his head, making his whole body disappear into nothing but particles.

"Celestial B has gone crazy! Is he really fighting in this space?!" One of the others shouted.

The twenty or so Celestials didn't seem confident after witnessing what Quinn had done. They already knew he was strong, and only his Celestial powers were quite lacking. But now, with Athos' defeat, his Celestial powers have grown exponentially, not to mention that he was already a master in combat experience.

"B, you might be a new Celestial, but even you should understand the consequences of fighting in this Space!" Another shouted.

"We just banned you from this place and decided not to take further action. You could have lived your own life without causing any more trouble for others and yourself."

"Instead, you decided to act and made every Celestial as your enemy. There will be those you defeat here, that will hunt you outside."

Quinn was looking at the floating particles. It seemed that destroying one of them hadn't completely scared them. It meant either the Celestials didn't care for their own or each other's life, or the death inside this space wasn't the same as outside.

Quinn predicted it was the latter for a while now, especially after hearing that they would come for him outside of this space, but there had to be some consequence.

"You are threatening me. My planet has been in trouble numerous times, and even now, all I want to do is to protect it. I don't understand why none of you is willing to hear me out? Why are you so eager to make an enemy out of me?" Quinn asked.

"People like you... the ones that think you can control everything and have things go your way, are exactly like those on earth before. So I will warn you again, and believe me, for I am in no mood to joke here."

"If you try to come to earth, I will ensure your death, and kill you over and over again, no matter how many times you reincarnate."

Playing nice wasn't working. It had not for a while with these lot, which was why Quinn had to change something, hoping he could strike fear into them. However, his words didn't seem to work, as they all began to charge straight toward him.

Extending his hands out like claws, Quinn was ready. He dashed forward, flipping the first one over his back, and then with the next, he quickly gave out a shocking thigh kick causing them to be sent flying into the white space in an entirely different direction.

As for the next, he grabbed them by the head and started running forward, using their body as some shield as he crashed through them. It was strange fighting like this, not just for Quinn but for the others as well.

Since they were only in their Celestial energy forms, Quinn was still winning out, but that was when he began to notice something. Although he was doing well against the Celestials against him, there were more and more of them coming his way.

"Damn it! I just want to find Bliss. Will this get your attention? Will it? Will it?!" Quinn shouted in his head.

From the outside, Xox noticed how many Celestials were now running forward. Word spread that B was going on a rampage, trying to kill every Celestial within the space. Of course, with Xox not being much of a fighter, he started to float around with no intention of getting involved.

"I might be a bit late, but the other Celestials should be able to deal with him by now. Still, let's just see how much damage he's caused." Xox stopped there because an entire crowd of Celestials, all of different shapes and sizes, was charging forward.

Suddenly, one Celestial that was as large as a tree could be seen starting to fall over, and on top of him was Quinn. However, he was unbothered by the fall and clawed one of the Celestials, ripping the energy from them, and quickly used his body as a base to push off his legs and dive into the others.

His speed was faster than most of the Celestials there, and the ones that could keep up could not deal with his power and skills.

"What is this... this is a first for Celestial Space. I think this is the first time anything like this has happened before. If this continues, even the Ancient Ones might get involved!" Xox shouted.

However, Quinn wasn't coming out unscathed. He was getting hit by the faster Celestials, tossed with powerful blows and from each hit, he could feel his energy dissipating as his glow slowly began to fade.

However, his speed, power and skills never faltered.

"If this is what you guys got, then I welcome you! You won't even be able to defeat half of the people from the Earth!" Quinn shouted like a mad man before throwing another punch, completely exhausted.

He could feel a strange strain throughout his body. It was almost as if he was completely disappearing. Still, Quinn didn't give up as he kicked, pushed and clawed at everyone who came at him but even for someone as great as Quinn, as powerful as he was, it was too much. Just then, a giant tail hit him, and finally, the energy of his whole Celestial Space body dissipated.

"Is he gone... is he finally defeated?" Xox thought with excitement since the worst of his days was over.

But, looking around at everyone's faces who had been there since the fight had begun, it was hard to tell if they had won. Then a shiver ran down his spine as a dreaded thought came to him: what would happen next?

How would everyone react to this? From the looks on their faces, he could tell no one now wanted to fight the real B. If he was this strong in here, he was definitely out of their league in the real world. Although this was the case for the majority of the celestials it wasn't for them all.

# Chapter 1809: " I'll be back!"

Quinn was thrown to the floor from his sitting position as if something had hit him. His body had slid across the spaceship floor before Sil moved and stopped it. Upon checking the former's condition, Sil found out Quinn was sweaty, and his chest was strangely rising up and down, which nearly never happened before, and after a moment, he finally opened his eyes.

"Quinn, Quinn!" He heard Sil call him out, bringing him out of the trance, "What happened, Quinn?"

"I think... I just died." Quinn replied. "Just like before, next to no time had passed in the real world. However, after being through such an intense situation for an incredibly long time, it felt all strange for him."

It was as if he was stuck in a dream, but it wasn't fake, and everything he did was real.

"What do you mean you died? What happened to you, Quinn? Is this because you were in slumber for a thousand years or something?" Sil asked again.

After sitting up on the floor, Quinn decided to explain everything to Sil. About the Celestials and the Celestial Space. He also revealed how they were after perhaps not just him but Sil too, after what the two of them had done to Athos.

What was frightening to Sil in the story that Quinn told was the number of Celestials in the Space. From the sounds of it, Quinn had fought and defeated many of them, but the number of Celestials seemed endless.

"You did what I would have done as well," Sil replied. "In my travels, I've seen some strange things in the places I have been."

"These Celestials don't see life anymore, and I'll be honest, as time passed, the perspective of life has changed a bit for me as well."

Quinn somewhat knew how Sil felt. Although he hadn't lived through the years that Sil had done, the feeling after becoming a celestial and seeing how the universe reacted to things made everything just feel a bit pointless.

"We can't think like that," Quinn said, shaking his head. "There are still people that me, you and everyone care about. We must think of them and ensure these Celestials can't just do what they want."

"Heck, I don't want to even think about leaving this world or the next until I have gotten a good hit on Bliss," Quinn swore.

The Spaceship was soon approaching the original Planet where Geo and the others had come from. During this time, Quinn checked a specific notification he had received while fighting.

[Your celestial body has been destroyed in the Celestial Space]

[You are unable to enter the celestial Space for one week]

"I knew there would be a drawback to dying in that place, but a whole week before I can enter again?"

"It means I won't be able to travel using the celestial space function and will have to find another way out of this place." Quinn thought.

"Still, can I even go back to that place? If I do, the same thing will ensue again. So what the hell do I do then?" Quinn thought.

On the bright side, at least Quinn's celestial energy, among other things, had remained the same. So there was not a huge downside to dying in the Celestial Space.

The Spaceship soon entered the planet's atmosphere, and upon reaching close to the land, they decided to dock just in front of the Tower. Seeing that the Tower was still the same, Quinn was quite surprised.

However, several Amra guards from the first few floors were also outside, with confusion on all of their faces.

When the ship landed, everyone was on guard, but as soon as they saw Geo, an evolved version of the Amra, and one of those from the higher level floors, they bowed down. They knew he was at least a Sedi rank based on his colours.

"Well, this is unexpected," Nock said as he looked at the Tower Guard Leaders, even those that were condescending to him in the past.

"It's good that you are all here in one place. It will make things a little easier for us." Geo addressed the Guards.

Geo explained what had transpired and how there was a battle between gods, although he chose to skip some details. Because many didn't know what Athos looked like, Geo claimed that Athos was the same shape and appearance as Quinn.

This way, Quinn getting rid of their current god didn't seem to hurt them as much. While speaking to the guards, Geo learned that the Tower was still functioning how it used to before.

Sil and Quinn looked at each other. It was possibly this was the only Tower they hadn't taken the nest Crystal out of and claimed its energy.

"Then... what should we do?" The Captains asked. "Is this our new god then? The one that has invaded us?"

Geo turned towards Quinn as he wanted the latter to answer, and it was then that Quinn walked over and put his hand on Geo's back.

"Don't move," Quinn instructed.

A red marking started to burn into Geo. It was the marking of the Celestial Quinn: a red dragon with two large wings. Quinn had informed Geo on the ship what he had planned to do and even taught Geo a sign to make him stop if he began experiencing pain.

[You have gained a dedicated follower]

Energy continued to transfer from one to the other, and it was a surprise for Quinn when Geo raised one of his arms at around the 10,000 Celestial energy mark. This action was the subtle sign Quinn had told him to make if he felt too much pain.

"He can hold a lot of energy. Is it because of his race or something else? Anyway, he deserves it. This is their place to look after, and I technically took this energy from their God." Quinn thought.

The others could see a red radiating glow around Geo. Some also noticed that the energy was similar to a few places in the Tower. Although it wasn't exactly the same, they had somewhat felt it before.

After this, Quinn decided to do the same for Nock and Dober. For these two, the Celestial points reached around the 1000 mark, which was still impressive compared to what Quinn had expected.

"I am a god of another world," Quinn then addressed the confused and amazed guards in front of him.

"So I can not stay here, but I have passed the energy that I have gained from your previous god onto these three here."

"They are all good people who helped me, and with their newfound prowess, they will be able to protect you. Heed to these three, if you have any problems with the Tower or what to do from here on."

It took a while for the Amra to realise what was happening, but surprisingly they seemed pretty welcoming of the change. These people needed someone to follow, give them orders and guide them, and none of them felt ready to step up to the challenge.

After the Guards dispersed, it was time for Sil and Quinn to head somewhere else, to try to find a way home because there was nothing else they could do here, but Geo wished to say his goodbyes.

"Quinn, I can't thank you enough. I plan to completely change this place into a far more peaceful place." Geo stated. "Our people didn't live horrible lives, but they certainly did live difficult lives."

"I want everyone to be able to experience everything they can in this world during their lifetime, and I hope I can achieve that."

"Quinn, do you remember what I said before? If there is ever anything you need, you are free to contact me."

Quinn smiled at Geo, and a thought came into his head.

"There is one thing you can do. If you can, can you build a statue of me? Then, once a month, you can get your people to present a few drops of blood with the statue's image in their heads, it would be a big help."

It was a strange request, but after finding out who and what Quinn was, Geo thought it might just be something they did, so he nodded to the request.

Turning around, Quinn had a small smile.

"In the celestial Space, I only have my celestial body to fight with."

"So I will now focus on gathering as much Celestial energy as possible, and when I re enter the Space, I'll make an even bigger entrance."
