# Chapter 1900 A Never Seen Before Anger

Although Quinn had never done such a thing with his blood before, it seemed like his theory had worked out, and his celestial blood had managed to make a connection with the Nest crystals. However, it wasn't just one Nest crystal, in total it looked like there were eight.

As there were eight glowing lines going straight towards where Quinn was.

'Since I have been studying more about how my powers work, it has allowed me to do more things with my powers. The more I learn about celestial energy, the shadow power, and the energies of the world in general, the more things I am able to do with them.

'I guess this was how the others were able to come up with their own techniques or own powers in the first place. Not just by replicating what they see.' Quinn thought, but he needed to focus on this strange occurrence.

'Why are there so many Nest Crystals in one location? Eight in total, there has to be a reason for this.'

Opening up his eyes, he could see Minny right in front of him just staring at the lines of blood on the floor. She too, looked to be concentrating and looking at what Quinn was doing. Then, when all of the blood lines returned to Quinn and seeing him stand up, she clapped her hands.

"What was that, that thing you did, can Minny do it as well?" Minny asked.

"I'm not sure…" Quinn replied back. "Although I'm sure in the future you will have plenty of time to test out those things. And besides, is there any reason for you to learn how to do something like that?"

Minny pumped her fist in the air as she smiled.

"Of course there is, I want to be as strong as Daddy! If I am Daddy's daughter then I need to be just as strong as him."

From the stories he had heard, Minny was quite the little monster vampire. Being incredibly strong, especially when using her celestial form, but Quinn treated Minny like his own and he would never want her to go into battle

"Hopefully there will be no need for you to worry about how strong you are in the future. Besides, let me take that burden." Quinn said as he picked Minny up, carrying her on his shoulders.

This time, since he knew where he was going and since it was slightly faster, he decided to run out there on his feet. Around an hour of running later, he had reached his destination.

The land of Mars was much like that of Earth, apart from the ground that was more of a red colour rather than a typical soil due to the high content of iron. It made some of the plants and trees that grew on the planet more robust compared to those on earth.

Which was why the current sight was strange. The trees, the grass, and nearly everything in the area looked to have been destroyed with no signs of life… like the old way of Mars, and for the first time, Quinn could see beasts.

One popped out of the ground looking like a giant lizard, it was standing on its back two legs attempting to bite down on another beast. As for the other creature, it looked more like a large insect with many long limbs and joints, it had wings as well but they looked to have been destroyed.

Since the two were fighting against each other, they had completely ignored Quinn as he continued forward. The only thing was, this scene that Quinn saw, was becoming a common occurrence.

More beasts were fighting each other as he got closer and closer to where the Nest crystals were. It wasn't just the number that was increasing, but also the tier of beasts. They were getting higher, and sometimes more than one beast was fighting against each other.

It was then that Quinn had seen one beast kill another and start to consume the crystal that was in its body.

'Is this the reason why the beasts have gotten stronger and have increased in level? Because they are constantly fighting against each other?'

Soon Quinn would know that his theory was right on point, because he had finally reached the Nest crystals. Where the largest parts of battle were going on.

Battles between all types of beasts continued as Quinn and Minny were in the thick of it. Once in a while Quinn would have to quickly move from his position to avoid getting hit by the attacks. The heat and energy was intense as most of the beasts here were at the Demi god tier level.

Then looking around he could see the Nest crystals, all of them were around a few hundred meters apart from each other.

'So the beasts that are being produced by the Nest crystals themselves are the cause of their infighting and battles. This is causing them to grow in strength quite quickly as they consume the beast crystals of their fallen prey.

'Andy told me not to get rid of the Nest crystals, but I suppose if I move them, then it should solve the problem as well. It might not solve the problem of the Horde attacks, I still have no idea why that is going on, but it will at least stop the high level Horde attacks from going on.'

When Quinn took a step forward towards the Nest crystals though, two of the large beasts that were fighting had turned their heads.

'I guess protecting the Nest crystals is still the most important thing to you.

Using blood aura, Quinn had hardened it to create two swords in his hands.

"I'm not much of a swordsman, but I have enough power and speed to do this."

A long-necked creature shot out its head, snapping it towards Quinn. Stepping to the side, he swung his blood aura sword down and sliced right through the beast's head, killing it as the head fell to the ground.

"I was just going to get rid of all the Nest crystals, but I guess I need to get rid of all of you annoying ones before I do anything else." Quinn stated, as the sword energy dispersed into nothing and he made a cut on his hand, ready to throw it onto the ground.

Just then, a large vine came out towards Quinn aiming to hit him, Quinn was going to take the attack as he thought it would do nothing to hurt him, as he had other ways to deal with such a thing, but before it got close… Minny had trapped the lightning fast green whip-like tentacle, and used her other hand to cut it straight off.

"See, I protected Daddy!" Minny cheered.

"Yes you did, thank you, and now daddy can get to work."

Placing his hand on the ground, blood had entered through the cracks, forcing itself to spread out in the entire area. Just like before, only this time, it was an attack rather than locating a certain object.

Out from the ground, right where the beasts were, several spikes of blood shot up, piercing through all of the beasts in a certain way.

It was the blood forest skill being used in action, as a wide range attack, how Quinn had originally intended it to be used. The only thing was, the blood forest attack also allowed one to consume the blood of its enemies that it pierced, but for the beasts their blood was still something that didn't quite work for vampires like him.

Now that all the beasts were dealt with, it was time for Quinn to grab the Nest crystals and move them apart. As he was doing this, and moving them around Mars, a thought came into his head.

'I wonder… there should be enough Nest crystals in this place, I should make note of where these are just in case they are needed again at some point.'

At the same time, Quinn had decided to take one of them for himself. He knew there were plenty and a certain someone that he was about to meet… perhaps there was a way he could use it to get stronger himself.

Now Quinn had the Nest crystal that could be used on Fex.

After splitting up all the crystals, Quinn had completed the task in half a day and was ready to return to the base. On his way there, he had used the shadow travel to avoid all of the Vampire Corps members because right now he just didn't want to deal with all of that.

After that, he had gone to the office where he soon found Andy.

Popping up, Andy was surprised to see him back so soon.

——

"Wait, you're saying it should all be okay now?" Andy replied, quite speechless.

"Somewhat. You won't have the same problem to the degree you were having before. Especially not any time soon since I dealt with all the beasts in the area. So, now that I have completed my half of the deal, I think it's time you completed yours."

Andy shook his head in disbelief, a problem that had been plaguing them for years had been solved in less than a day. It was safe to say Andy had underestimated the strength of the person in front of him.

"Very well, let's get going, shall we." After saying these words, Andy thought Quinn would be happy, but instead he had a large frown on his face, and it almost looked like there was a vein about to pop. It was the first time he had seen a certain someone so angry.

That was because Quinn was angry, because there was a message from a certain someone through his system.

[A message has been received from Celestial 'Bliss.']

***

# Chapter 1901 Urgent Call




The Celestials all had something similar to Quinn, a system that allowed them to send messages to each other. Although the feature for Quinn to send out messages to others was recently unlocked, and it looked like that happened because he had levelled up, Quinn didn't really have any friends in the Celestial space, and if he was to send a message to Bliss and the others, it would just be a load of hate anyway so it was unlikely they would reply.

Since he had chosen to ignore it, he had somewhat forgotten that it even existed, and yet here, there was a message in front of him from the one and only person that knew who he was.

'What does she want?' Quinn thought as his finger hovered over the button to open the message up. 'Every time I have gotten involved with her, something ends up going wrong.'

Truthfully, Quinn had somewhat forgiven her for what she had done to him. That was because during his journey he had learnt a lot from the other planets and it was quite enjoyable.

In the end, nothing had gone wrong either, everything was fine, and everyone was safe when he returned. However, there was one thing that he could never forgive, and it was the reason why he was filled with anger at the moment.

It was the fact that she had taken the shadow from Minny at the time. The shadow was there to protect her, and the way Minny had described how scared she was at the time, and to do that to someone he cared about, it was something that the b*tch deserved getting hit in the face for, even if it was just once.

"Is everything alright, Quinn? If you want, we can always visit my father later. After all, he has all the time in the world." Andy said, approaching carefully.

Thankfully, his words got through to Quinn and calmed him down a little. Now, an internal debate had started inside him because he was wondering if he should open the message and read it or not or continue on with getting Fex out of that box he had been in for a while.

"Arghhh, this is so annoying," Quinn said out loud, which made Andy wonder what could the legendary Hero possibly be struggling with.

This was a person that had it all, had the strength to change and do whatever he wished. It was hard to imagine if a horde with a demon-tier beast didn't give him trouble, what could?

In the end, Quinn felt like he had no choice, otherwise, the contents of the message would just bug him forever.

[I know you don't like me.]

It was the first line of the sentence, and that was nearly enough to just make Quinn close the message, but he continued reading.

[However, whether you like it or not, the two of us have the same goal, and that is protecting the people on Earth. Ray eventually realised that, and he was a Talen, and you are one as well, so I hope you will realise that.

[Earth is in trouble, in serious trouble, and I mean it. Otherwise, I wouldn't be contacting you right now. Someone needs your help, and if they don't get it, then you and everyone could be in serious trouble.

[Travel to these locations... It is urgent to get there as soon as possible!!!]

The end of the message was a bunch of numbers that Quinn really didn't understand, but they looked like the universal coordinates that one could input into the ships to assign a destination. Which meant the place where Quinn needed to be was most likely not on Earth.

'What is this... can't she just be clear about what she wants me to do? It sounds like she wants to meet me... or me to meet someone else. This whole thing could be a trap again by her to send me away.

'Although, if that happens, I could try and contact Yongbu to send me back to Earth, right? Either way, this is seriously annoying because she didn't mention any details other than the fact that it sounds like I'm going to need to fight.'

Thinking about it for a while, looking at Andy, and then turning and looking at Minny, Quinn sighed as he had made his decision.

"I'm sorry, Andy, but something urgent has come up. I promise I will be back soon, and I hope you aren't so busy and can help me out then."

Before Andy could reply, Quinn covered himself in shadows and had taken Miny into his shadow space again. Just as he left, there was a large smile on Andy's face.

'You idiot, I will always have time for someone like you.' Andy thought. 'Now I'm starting to understand why my father liked you so much.'

As for what Quinn was doing, he was using the shadow link to hop to someone who had recently woken up, and Quinn soon found himself inside Logan's lab, surrounded by everyone.

"Quinn, what are you doing here?" Alex asked, and the other races were confused as well.

"Whoa, you can do that?" Jake said.

Vincent, Jake, Logan and Alex seemed to be talking about something in the lab. Unbeknownst to Quinn, Jake had just returned with the items that were needed.

"I'm sorry, but this is quite an urgent matter. It looks like I need to go somewhere. Logan, can you input these coordinates and tell me where they lead to?" Quinn asked as he read out a bunch of numbers.

Quinn could see a bunch of crystals that were in Alex's hands. He could tell that there were a couple of demon tier crystals in there, however, there was no Nest crystal as requested.

"I'm sorry, I couldn't find a nest crystal, but I thought if I came back and gave the demon tier items first that he could work on that," Jake explained what Quinn was thinking.

"Don't worry," Quinn replied as he summoned his own demon tier crystal and handed it to Alex. "I managed to get my own Nest crystal."

"Finding a nest crystal and a demon crystal in such a short time. Well, you are still impressing me as always." Vincent commented. It had been a long time since he had seen Quinn, seen his strength, so he currently had no idea what Quinn was capable of.

"Well, this is great! I can start making the weapons straight away, and with you here, we can add your blood just like you asked." Alex suggested.

There was a hesitant look on Quinn's face, and not one of joy like Alex had expected.

"What's wrong?" Alex asked.

"You said that the weapons would take maybe a week or so to make, right? So you need my blood at some point during the process. How early do you need my blood?"

Quinn didn't want to delay the process of the weapons at all. Once he had the weapons and the location of Erin and Zero, he would be off. The only thing was, right now, he needed to be somewhere else as well.

"Ah...I guess you need to be somewhere. Well, I actually only need it in the starting phase, but it will take me about an hour or so to get ready. Is that okay?" Alex asked.

"Quinn!" Logan shouted. "Those coordinates, they're on Venus. I have a teleporter that will get you there quite quickly if need be."

Venus was a habitable planet. The greenhouse gases had been removed from the planet, making it a bearable place to live, but it was still relatively hot compared to others. However, the people that lived there were more neutral than anything, just those not wanting to get involved in any of the mess. It had a low population as well.

It was strange that this location was given, so Logan was assuming the worst, which was why he had made his suggestion.

"One hour, right? Okay, I'll give you that one hour. Let's work on this now!" Quinn ordered.

Hoping that whatever he was needed for could wait.

# Chapter 1902 A Tired Slayer




The first event that started to move the cogwheels on the political landscape of the Earth was the Chained Wedding. It was an event that was talked about by the entire human race for a while. Several videos had hit hundreds of millions of views and were all being watched daily to get as much information as possible.

It was the first time a powerhouse was taken out, defeated in front of the whole world by a new group no less, and against such a small number of people as well. This had told the world that no group was safe.

However, even after the crushing defeat and many switching sides at the end, the Chained didn't cease to exist. Those in the Blade family still saw it as their mission to capture the unruly Chained. Their ancestors still chose to use their powers in cruel and harsh ways.

At the same time, those who were part of the Chained before and had left were finding it somewhat difficult to live a normal life. If they tried to join a faction for fear of angering certain people, they didn't accept them.

This was common, and because of this, the Chained had gone back to their old ways, forcing people to help them. Still, there was a question in public and the chained members' minds.

What had happened to their leader?

The leader was known as Russ to the world, and there was no footage of him during the wedding. After seeing how he was forcing a particular woman to marry him, the world viewed him as an evil vile being.

Some said that this was the reason why he hadn't appeared, others theorised that he had been killed off during the wedding but no one was there to see it. Since there was no confirmation Russ's name would be passed around from time to time.

The truth was, Russ was still alive, and he wasn't living the spectacular life he used to in his faction days. Using a robe to cover his face; he had managed to live by joining factions and hunting beasts.

He lived quite a good life in terms of a traveller, but it wasn't the same life he lived before. A short while after the wedding, Russ walked enter his room as he usually did after a long tough hunt.

The only thing was there was an uninvited guest in the room, standing by the window.

"I never thought I would see you again. I thought you would have completely abandoned me after I was useless and used for your goal." Russ commented as he took off his robe and went to lie on his bed.

"Used you?" Bliss replied. "I helped you, without me you would have never realised the true potential of your powers. Remember I was the one that introduced her to your team."

Her response made Russ frown. He wasn't bothered by the response, but rather by her body language.

They had seen each other on and off a few times, and during all of those times, he had never seen Bliss act this way. Right now, she was agitated and flustered, but at the end of the day this wasn't his problem.

"Ah yes, and now without them, I have an ability that takes up far too many MC points if I was to go against someone strong. Leaving me with an ability that is mid tier at beast." Russ complained.

"Mi- tier? Do you have no clue just how strong your ability is? You have a power that is able to take down gods!" Bliss said, getting more agitated. "But I understand your frustration, and it's part of the reason why I have come out here. I have a way for you to grow your powers."

Suddenly, Russ was no longer lying on his bed as he got upright. Ever since then, he had wondered if he would ever be the same as he was before. Would he ever be able to feel the same power as he had done when fighting against Quinn Talen? It was hopeless, and on top of that, his revenge against the Blade family would never be complete with the power he had at the moment.

"I see that caught your attention." Bliss opened a small portal with her hand and pulled out a Crystal. "This here is what is called a nest crystal, and we are going to use them to get your powers back to the way they once were."

After that, Bliss taught Russ how to absorb the energy of the nest Crystal in order to increase his MC points. She had given him three Nest crystals in total, boosting him from the current way he was.

That was all she could give, though, and claimed that the rest was up to Russ, but also gave him details of how to get Nest Crystals. With this there was a goal in Russ mind once more, and he began to work as a traveller.

He rose through the ranks, joining larger and bigger groups discovering Nest crystals on the way. There were times where there was also news of other groups discovering Nest crystals.

When this happens, a mysterious robe figure would visit them, and their group would be no more as a nest Crystal was taken. Most people had no clue what to do with them and it felt like to Russ this was a cheat that only he had, something that he could take advantage of.

In the first place there weren't many that could even get to a nest crystal with their power they would need an entire army but for Russ it was the easiest thing in the world.

Eventually though, his betrayal and antics had caused Russ to go to a quieter planet, to go into hiding and travel from there, which had brought him to the planet Venus. A planet that was covered in meadows and had plentiful small little villages.

It was one of the few planets that had next to no beasts on it. There were the occasional beast that would escape from time to time, or be brought back, but other than that it was a peaceful place,relative to the people that lived there.

For a while Russ had decided to lay low. What he had found was rather than doing all of the work himself, it was easier to let the higher factions get an inkling to a nest Crystal, or discover one and take it from them.

Following the news forums, he could see when they were recruiting a large team, and it was always for the same people, and for the same pattern.

"Good morning Dean!" A jolly woman said with a nice smile as she watered her planets hanging outside her home.

"Good morning miss Fern!" Russ waved back, walking through the village. His appearance had slightly changed from before, but it also seemed like the people that lived here didn't care about the news.

Since Russ would only go out when there was word of a Nest Crystal then come back from time to time this place had come to his base, and the people all got to know him. And he got to know them all.

After all, there were only 200 or so people in the village.

"Ah someone help, a beast a beast!" A woman wearing a dress shouted as she ran across the stone paved village. Shortly behind her there was a large balck cat with razor sharp teeth.

Seeing this enter the village, everyone panicked, there was hardly anyone who would deal with such a thing, that was until, the large cat suddenly started to swing at the air, and eventually it had collapsed just like that.

When it did, there was a certain person standing behind.

"Dean...was that you?" Fern asked.

"I used to be a Traveller but..my fighting days are over." Russ smiled.

The people were thankful, they were praising him, and would shower him with gifts as this continued, but it was then when looking up at the sky, a bright white light could be seen twilight from above.

"What is that?"

****

# Chapter 1903 Real Vs Copy




When he raised his head to look up, Russ had no idea what the bright light was. However, it was clear to him that this was bad news. The energy was so spread out and intense that the clouds had separated, which was enough to put him on edge.

This was why he quickly ran from the spot where he was, and as soon as he moved, the white light shot down from the sky and headed towards the ground, shrouding a wide area.

Turning around, Russ was blinded by the bright light and lifted his arm, covering his eyes. He had just escaped by the skin of his teeth. A few moments of silence prevailed, and a few moments later, the panicked shouts and cries echoed as the villagers were now terrified. They had already had an unusual experience and a fright for their life with the beast's appearance, and now there was this as well.

'This light, what is going on? Is it an ability, or is it an invasion of some sort? No, this all feels too foreign. Ever since I got involved with that god, strange things have been happening.' Russ frowned. He prepared himself for the worse.

Eventually, the bright light started to fade, and now in its place, was what looked like a giant bird. Although it was a bird, it was unlike Russ had ever seen before.

It stood on its two small legs. They were tiny compared to the rest of its body, which was quite thin but as large as a person. Its skin was dark blue, with strange black swirling patterns on its skin.

Unlike a normal bird, this one didn't have any feathers. Rather, it was more scaley, like a lizard, at least just from an initial look of it. Then there was its long tail and two wings.

On closer inspection, since there were no feathers on its wings, it made the wings look more like two large hands clawing inwards. In addition, there were five individual claws on both wing-like arms, and the same could be said for its tail.

Finally, there was its bird-like head, small in size but with a fin on the top like that of a shark, and a black mane around its neck. This was the only hairy bit on the bird which reminded Russ of the mane on a lion.

"Is it a beast?" A villager whispered in a trembling voice as they cowered behind a plant.

Immediately, the figure turned its head and stared at the person, a large woman, who had said those words.

"How dare you call me a beast?! I am Weet, a Celestial from a place far above any of you!" the bird declared.

Quite a crowd from the villagers had gathered at where the bright light had come, but at the same time, they were too afraid to come close. Instead, they all carefully watched, trembling and scared. They didn't understand what a Celestial was, and they were not curious enough to ask.

"You." Weet then turned to look at Russ. "You are the only one who is not scared of me. I guess it is a trait of who you are, a God Slayer."

"Should I be scared?" Russ replied. "I have lived this long, and I will continue to live. I am not worried."

The strange bird spoke without opening its mouth, yet everyone in the area could hear its laughter and the words it said.

"I like to do things the quick and easy way, so I hope you don't mind," Weet said in a low tone that rumbled the stomachs of those nearby. "It would be easy if you were to just kill yourself. That way, my task will be complete.

"However, I know you wouldn't simply comply, so, if you don't kill yourself within one minute, then everyone in the area will die."

It was clear to Russ that this beast, or Celestial as it called itself, was after him. Although he was unsure why this was, considering that he had managed to upset quite several people during his time, there were plenty of reasons for people to chase after him.

And this was not the first time someone had come after him. Russ lifted his head, and a smirk appeared on his face.

"You don't seem to know me very well, do you?" Russ asked. "You see, I think you have the wrong person. I don't care what you do to these people."

The words were said out loud, and the villagers that heard the man they knew as Dean say this were surprised.

"What do you mean, Dean?" the shaking woman asked from before. "Didn't you just save us from that beast before? Are you saying you're just going to let us kill these things?"

Suddenly, the woman stopped in her tracks after taking a few steps toward Russ. It wasn't because she was afraid but because her body had stopped listening to her, and her brain as well, as her head slid off from her body, and the strange bird, Celestial Weet, was right behind her.

"You have 30 seconds," Weet said.

The woman was dead. After her head rolled to the ground, the rest of her body also fell. The Celestial had moved and attacked in such a swift manner that Russ didn't even see it move.

'This will be a tough fight, maybe the first one since I went up against Quinn. But have I consumed enough nest crystals for my power to be what it was back then?' Russ wondered.

Seeing the dead body on the floor, the people started to panic. They were screaming at the top of their lungs as they ran about. Some tried to get as far away from the bird creature as possible, while others went back into their homes and the closest shops and boarded up for protection when they heard it speak once again.

"Time is over. I am not so sure if you are bluffing or not. You are a strange one. Celestials see lives as nothing because we see them come anew and be replaced all the time, but the ones below us see it differently. It's the first time I am meeting someone like you.

"Still, you could just be bluffing, so I should make sure, right? I don't like to go back on my words."

Weet flapped its wings and took up into the air. It came as a surprise because the wings were thick and looked heavy, yet Weet had no problem flying above the village.

It then looked down, and its eyes started to glow blue, like a mist floating off into the air.

"No one can hide from me." Weet crackled.

The swirling black patterns on its scales began to light up in a light blue colour, and then, small blue lasers shot off from its body.

There were hundreds of small lasers, and they were directed at everyone in the village, hitting them right through the head. Men, women, children all fell to the ground in seconds as the lasers went through their heads.

As Weet had declared, no one could hide as the laser beam attack went through the buildings and still managed to hit its target. In one move, everyone in the area was killed, just as Weet said. However, the results were different when a laser struck the primary target.

Just like the others, the laser had hit the man's head, but it soon started to flash, and before it could even reach Russ, his body disappeared and reappeared at a different spot this time.

Done with its attack, Weet landed back down on the ground.

"So you are still alive. I expected nothing less from a God Slayer."

Russ clenched his fist.

"I see, so you really did care for those people. It was a bluff, after all."

"You overestimate your threats," Russ said, lifting his head. "But you have ruined my hiding spot. Now because of you, I will have to start all over again, and for that, I will make you pay."

A blue mist started to emit from Russ's eyes and sporting out from his back all of a sudden were a pair of large thick wings that had five claws out the back of them.

They looked exactly like Weet, and even the Celestial seemed surprised upon seeing this.

——

While the fight was going on, someone was observing the battle from Celestial space.

"Russ…the fight with Quinn has made you grow leaps and bounds. You are strong in your own right, and I hope you won't need the help that is coming because it might not arrive in time."

*****

# Chapter 1904 A Limit




Russ's body had taken on a similar form to his opponent Weet. The only thing different was the human body and because of this, the celestial was being a little careful.

Flapping his wings, Russ rose up high in the air, and parts of his body started to glow blue just like Weet. Now the celestial knew what was coming next, this wasn't just an imitation it was an exact copy of what was to come.

Several sharp blue lasers shot out towards the celestial. Since there was only one target, all the small lasers had spread making it impossible for the attack to miss and Weet knew this best.

Which was why it decided to cover its head with its two large wings. The two claw like ends of the wings had interlocked with each other. The next second the wings had expanded creating half a ball blocking the vital parts of the celestial.

The lasers had hit the wings causing smoke to come off from them. There was a slight tingling sensation that was felt, but the attack didn't get through, and the lasers eventually stopped.

Opening up its wings, the calm face of the bird was still present, if anything it looked like Weet was now smiling.

"My attack is a strong one, but nothing can get through the defense of these wings. Honestly, I'm quite impressed you managed to even slightly injure them." Weet proclaimed.

That was when the smile on Weet's face had vanished because he noticed that Russ was doing something. He was still in the air and the spiraling patterns that were on his wings and tail, they were lighting up once more.

"Whatever you can do, I can do better." Russ stated, as he used the same attack once again. Lasers came out from his body all aiming toward Weet.

The attack was incredibly fast and the only reason why Weet was able to block it last time was due to it somewhat guessing what its opponent was going to do.

'There should be a slight cool down before releasing an attack like that again, how was he able to release it twice in a row?' Weet struggled but did the only thing it could do, and that was to give the same attack back.

Its body lit up, and several blue lasers came out from its body, aiming to match each one of Russ's. The great eyesight that Weet had allowed it to do such a thing.

"Your mere imitation will never be as good as mine God Slayer!" Weet shouted.

When both of the lasers hit each other, it didn't last long as there was a clear winner in power out of the two. Russ's lasers had completely destroyed Weet's and continued forward hitting each part of Weet's body.

Using the lasers he brought them together to condense the power of them even more, and pushed Weet with his own powers until it was on the ground unable to get up. The force of it was strong and its whole skin and body was burning up.

"How can this be… it makes no sense!" Weet struggled and eventually managed to muster up the great strength to move its wings and block the condensed lasers. It was for a brief second which allowed Weet to push with its tail moving from its position.

There were several parts of flesh that were burning on the celestial where it had pierced through its rough skin, but slowly they were starting to heal, forming back to what they once were.

Weet's head was shaking with rage.

"This is why I wanted to finish things quickly and through the other way!"

——

Watching the fight from the celestial space, Bliss was impressed with what Russ had done. She had expected him to put up somewhat of a fight, but this was beyond what she had imagined.

'He must have obtained quite a few Nest crystals if he's able to make attacks like that appear.' Bliss thought. 'This is why Russ is important for the world.

'His powers aren't an illusion like many people guess. It's different, and in a way, it's a counter to the celestials that think incredibly highly of themselves. Which is just causing Russ's powers to be boosted even more.

'Still, there is a problem, if you still had her by your side I wouldn't worry… but the stronger these attacks are…'

——

Frustrated, Weet flew into the air, and started to spin its body. As it did and picked up the pace. It started to give off a strange blue aura. The air looked denser around the celestial strangely.

Seeing this, Russ did the same as what Weet had done before, and closed his wings together. In doing so, they expanded in size creating half a ball like shield.

'I know from your words before, that in your mind, you think that there is nothing that can break through this! So this should work!'

The next moment, Weet slammed into Russ's wings and waves and waves of pressure continued to hit behind Russ. Some of the buildings that were high enough were being destroyed and evaporating into nothing.

Still in the air, still there, was Russ though, all in one piece.

Both Weet and Russ fell to the ground.

"How! How were you able to block my attack!"

"I guess you just think your defence is stronger than your attack," Russ replied but was heavily concerned about something after that attack.

The question had popped into his mind, how could he win this fight? Russ was on a time limit due to his MC cells. He had landed an attack, but the celestial in front of him looked completely fine.

With everything he had, searching through his powers he didn't have a solution to win, not unless he could continuously use his powers freely like he could before.

'I need more nest crystals, more power, before I fight someone like this.' Which was why Russ had decided to run.

He flapped his wings and flew off into the distance, weaving and swerving in and out of the buildings. He continued going forward but in the end, the buildings had ended and now there was just long grass for a few good miles.

Turning his head, Russ was trying to see if Weet was chasing after him, and there he was, right on his tail. When close enough, Weet flapped its wing and a beam of energy was shot out hitting Russ right on its body, sending him flying and crashing into the ground.

His arm was bleeding and he was in pain.

'My real body was hit… this is bad, it's harder to… fake it.' Russ thought.

Now he was starting to wonder if running was the best decision for him to make, but fighting, he would have eventually lost he knew because there were some things he could see that he couldn't use.

'I will just have to buy time.' Russ thought standing up and retracting the wings and tail into his body.

Russ started to walk and each time he took a step, a copy of him seemed to appear. He continued this, creating ten versions of himself.

"You have seen what I can do, do you really think just copying yourself is going to do anything? I will just kill you all." Weet declared, as its body lit up, and the other Russ's started to disappear.

It wasn't quite the same laser attack as before, it was almost as if there were small particles of energy that were hitting everything, and that included Russ's body.

Slowly, he could see that the air looked to be glowing slightly blue and his skin was starting to hurt all over. It was a strange sensation as if he was being burnt alive.

Trying to move, he could still feel pain, until.

"Just get out of there," a voice said and suddenly Russ could feel his body being dragged and moved out of the strange glowing dust. He crashed against the grass and found himself looking up.

"Qu..Quinn." Russ said surprised to see him here of all places.

Standing in the middle between the two of them now, was none other than Quinn.

"BB, I have heard a lot about you, but I am here to tell you that I am not your enemy. We are both celestials and we both have a task, to get rid of the God Slayers.

"But if you choose to go against us that will be bad, not just for you, but for Earth as well. So, choose." Weet asked.

# Chapter 1905 The Future Is A Mess




A sick feeling was felt deep within Sil's stomach as he sat in his ship. He was taking his time returning to where he originally was and continuing on his journey outside of the world.

Afterall, he had seen what was to come, and knew that whatever the cause, these celestials would one day attack earth. However, when using his power so drastically to see into the future, he was unable to see as clearly as he could, seeing moments into the future.

There was too much overload of information so he just saw glimpses, more like that of a dream. Which was why Sil had no clue as to why they would attack.

Regardless Sil just didn't think this way, rather than ask why they attacked and try to stop them from attacking, Sil wanted to get stronger just to stop the invasion.

'Should I try and look again? Maybe if I lowered the output of MC cells I would be able to see slightly into the future.' Sil thought. 'And learn if I have done enough to stop this.'

Although Sil didn't know why he felt this way, after meeting with Quinn, he wanted to see the others, see those from the Blade family and those from the Cursed faction. Spend a few years with them and stop travelling the vast universe for years and years, just endlessly fighting with no end in sight. It had its exciting moments, but soured compared to the time he spent with others.

'Logan said that looking into the future that far ahead is tricky to do, because one could only see one of the outcomes that was possible. Perhaps knowing the outcome was the cause of the outcome.

'So it was best to not constantly look into the future trying to fix what was happening. Solving problems now often leads to bigger problems in the future. The humans know that well.'

In the end, Sil couldn't help himself. He didn't activate all of his MC cells while attempting to use the ability. Worrying that he would see too much like last time.

Then finally it was used, images flashed in his mind, in front of him like they were on superspeed. He was now concentrating hard, trying to find anything, trying to follow what he was seeing. Usually using the ability with his eyes open would allow him to see an outline of what was in front of him, but using the ability to this level with this much MC cells it had somewhat even changed the ability, evolving it, to the point where these images were shown in his head.

Not just that, but he could somewhat choose where he saw these images, the only thing was it was difficult to control, not impossible to control completely in a certain direction.

Yet for some reason, he started to think about home, and when thinking about home it took him to the Blade ship, one of the Bertha's that had become the Blade home.

Just after a few seconds, Sil opened his eyes, he stopped using his ability and bit on his lip hard drawing blood.

"What was that… nothing changed… no it seems to have gotten worse." Sil said. "And why… how could the whole of the Blade family just be annihilated like that and by who?"

Immediately, Sil started to punch in some coordinates on his ship and started to return, returning to the Blade's to see them before he went off.

'I don't really know how far off that was into the future, but where was I, where was Quinn to stop all of this. He's back on Earth now right? Everything should be okay again, right!'

Now Sil had only messed up his own mind and it was just as Logan said. He was unsure that if he stayed with them, that it would somewhat be the cause of the Blade's demise, or if he left to deal with the problem up front that they would be okay, or perhaps leaving them all to be killed.

However, he couldn't take any chances. He was heading back to the Blade's now.

It didn't take long for Sil to see the large giant ship floating in Earth's orbit. The Blade ship often stayed between Mars and Earth, as they somewhat acted independently, and from time to time the members of the Blade would act as mercenaries for disputes, battles, and quests that the others needed help with from time to time.

Shiro had just returned to the group, and once again he was back in his body  taking charge of everything that was going on. There was a warm welcome for him back in the ship as he talked to all the others and told them what he had learned and everything that was going on so far.

At the same time the group was glad to see that Borden had also returned in one piece. There were no grave injuries on his body, and soon their routine had returned to normal, until.

"Sir, sir!" A young female ran up to Shiro as he was walking around the halls, looking at everyone working diligently hard. On board the ship there wasn't just the Blade's but a number of different ability users as well.

They were part of the Blade group, helping with their mercenary tasks and maintenance around the ship and more. After all, the Blade's also needed them around because apart from a certain someone, without abilities they were useless.

"What is it?" Shiro asked. "Should I be concerned that you're so panicked?"

"There is a ship heading this way, it's been giving us a code of 3235 which we don't recognize."

Hearing the numbers, the old code that the Blade's used to use, Shiro's eyes lit up.

'It's your brother, Sil… he returned.'

They had been informed that Quinn and Sil had come back. After helping the group with the Red Vampires, they had returned and were unable to see Quinn or Sil, so they assumed they were just too busy.

'Maybe he misses us?' Vorden stated.

'Misses us? Are you crazy now after all this time!' Raten shouted. 'That damn kid, no matter how many years pass he is still the same immature brat.'

Giving permission for the ship to land, they immediately headed to the docking station. It was Shiro, and Borden were the only ones, however Shiro had switched to Vorden, he didn't think it was right for him to be the first to greet their brother they hadn't seen in a while.

Although the other Blade's knew about Sil, as stories about him had been passed on, they weren't alive during his time and he sounded somewhat like a legend similar to Quinn. So most wouldn't be able to recognize him.

Getting off the ship, Sil looked to be in a panicked state but upon seeing everyone his hand was placed on his chest and he gave out a big sigh.

"I'm so happy to see that all of you are alright." Sil said with a smile.

"Same to you… but you have aged a lot since the last time I saw you… you look so…" Vorden didn't know the right words to say.

"I look like him a lot, I know." Sil replied, not wanting to remember those times so much.

The three, or four of them had caught up quite a bit as Shiro would change from Vorden to Raten, and Borden would all talk. After all, all of them were brothers and were used to their presence.

When they entered the main hall of the ship, there were many that looked at them wondering just who Shiro was being so friendly with, since it was a face they had never seen before.

While in the middle of their conversation though, the ship felt a great force being slammed on it. It shook the entire thing, causing people to lose their footing and fall down.

"Are we under attack?" Borden wondered, but the single beam had stopped, and strangely when looking in front of them there was someone in the centre of the room they had never seen before.

"This energy… it's the same as Athos." Sil recognized as he stared at the person.

"So you are the famous God Slayer, and the one that has caused the most problems for us." the stranger stated.  The stranger looked almost human if it weren't for the fact it had purple like skin. Other than that though it looked identical to a human.

"I guess that's why they sent me, Kipo, to deal with you, and while I'm at it. I might as well kill everyone here to make sure there are no more God Slayers from this annoying place."

For a second hearing those words Sil's heart beat slightly louder.

"Really… well you're an idiot." Vorden replied, walking forward. "Not only have you chosen to go after my brother Sil who could deal with you on his own, but you have done so, in the middle of all of these Blade's and our Dalki brother here… and we don't take threats nicely."

# Chapter 1906 The Last Celestial Hunter




Bliss's hand was shaking as she held onto the staff. There was a moment when watching Russ's battle that she thought he would be eliminated and if that was the case then, it would mean one less God Slayer to fight back against what was to come.

'You finally made it.' Bliss thought. However her worries hadn't ended there, as there was a fear, a fear that Quinn would, instead of teaming up with Russ, team up with the celestial, after all, Russ wasn't the most saintly person. The two of them had history and some of the celestials could be quite quick with their decisions.

'I can't watch this, not right now.' Bliss said to herself as she waved her staff and the space she had created to watch the ongoing fight had disappeared.

Since time in the celestial space was completely different compared to that on Earth. She wouldn't miss any of the fight, but would come back to watch it when she was ready.

Instead, she thought she would try and get information on the other celestials that were sent to attack, and see if they had found the Godslayers that they had been looking for.

​ The thing was in Earth's time they had literally years to scout all of the white energy to try and find the God Slayers of Earth, and only a few minutes would have passed.

'I'm not going to go looking around myself, that would take too much time, but there is one person that should know a few things, that busy body.'

Waving her staff, the celestial system had appeared and a message was sent out to a specific celestial. After a few minutes there was a large floating ball of energy that was coming right towards her.

'Why… why am I the one that keeps getting dragged around, i'm just a sweet innocent ball!' Xox thought to himself, but he didn't want to get on Bliss's or Immortui's bad side, so it was best that he listened to their order.

"Please can we keep this short?" Xox asked in a pained voice. "Your really not the best person to be speaking to at the moment. Or at least you could not form your energy into that staff that you always have around you. It makes you quite recognizable around here to the others."

Realizing what Xox said was true, Bliss got rid of her staff-shaped energy and the energy returned back into her body.

"I wanted to ask… the celestials that Mundus has sent. Have they all left the space, have they all found the God Slayers that they were looking for?" Bliss asked.

Hearing the question Xox was quite excited because, just like Bliss had expected, he had been gathering information from all over.

"Nearly all of them apart from one." Xox replied. "Tumoon is still waiting. According to the reports that have been gathered from those that have been around the earth area, the God Slayer that they were keeping their eye on has left Earth's solar system and is beyond, which is why it's proving to be quite difficult.

"On top of that, they are debating whether to send Tumoon to fight against the Godlsayer that recently won its battle. Honestly, no one expected Zeko to lose."

Bliss had managed to catch that fight first hand. It was popular amongst many celestials since it was the first battle that was to take place. However, the way Zeko lost after fighting for several days was a large shock to all.

Honestly, Bliss thought that if Zeko had gone against anyone else, he probably would have won, it was just that he happened to have run into Ray, but that had given a chance to the rest of the God Slayers to come out on top.

"Tell me what has happened so far from your words.

Listening to Xox speak, Bliss had been updated, and she was surprised at the timing of it all. Although there were only so many from Earth that had the power or title classified as a God Slayer, there were plenty on earth that had great power and came close to it.

If it was God Slayer just against the fighting celestials then they would probably lose, but they had those people by their side.

"Hey it looks like Tumoon is getting ready to leave." One of the celestials shouted.

Quickly running over to where the direction was, Bliss looked at the white ball of energy that Tumoon was ready to enter, and it was strange she had never seen or heard of this planet before, which was why she was surprised to hear that there was a human on it of all places.

—

On a planet that was filled mostly with green, large trees, plants, and more, which also had large giant factories on it was the centre of attention, just then, a gigantic ship that had Marpo Cruise on it was drifting towards the planet, to dock and have a few repairs be done on it.

On the outside platform there were Dalki waving the ship in with their hands, and a few other races from all over, who were ready with their tools to do a few repairs here and there.

Watching everything going on, was a particular person who was in a large glass building, the owner of the entire Marpo Cruise.

"After the repair is done, tell all the other cruises out there to come back." The man ordered the person who was by his side, his eyes a tint of red as they both looked out of the glass to the area ahead of them.

"Does this mean, you will finally make your move after all this time?" the red eyed man replied back.

"Everything is ready, we have made preparations on top of preparations. Honestly I don't think there is a single thing that can stop us.

"The Blade family, Green City, Pure, The Vampire Corps, the Red Vampires, the Graylash family and the Cursed faction including Quinn. Even if they were all to team up together and try to stop this, it would be impossible."

The man by his side chuckled.

"If people had heard you say those words, some would think you were mad, but that's just because they don't understand the power we have been able to accumulate during this whole time. As cautious of a person I am, I know what you are saying is true.

"Pine!" The red eyed man called out.

Heavy footsteps were heard coming from the back of the room, and that was when a Dalki with a strange upward mountain-like head came into view.

"Send out the order for everyone to get ready, and tell them soon we'll be returning back home. Also, make sure that he is awake. We will need him as well."

"Of course." The Dalki smiled and began to take a few steps forward but as he did, a strange surge of energy could be felt. The colour of the sky had slightly changed and when looking up through the glass ceiling, they could see that in the sky there was a beam of white energy.

"What is that?" The man asked.

"I thought that this might happen, it is perhaps something that I should have warned you about." The red eyed man stated. "It appears that our strength has caught the attention of them."

"Who?"

"The attention of the gods."

Finishing his sentence the white energy beamed down hitting and smashing right through the glass, breaking it to pieces,each of them looked away, but soon the energy started to disappear and in its place was a large bald headed man who looked human, apart from the fact that there were six eyes on his head that were glowing blue.

The god looked around the room for a few seconds.

"You are not the ones I am looking for, but he is in this building." Tumoon stated.

"So this is a god, well it will be a good test for us then to see if we are ready or not." The man smiled. "Bring H here, just to be sure to get rid of this guy."

# Chapter 1907 The World Battle (Part 1)




Unbeknownst to the world, the human race was undergoing a tough battle. The celestial space, the world of the gods, had acted for the first time in thousands of years.

The recent influx of God Slayers that was coming just from a single race for whatever reason worried them, which was why, they had sent celestials that had done this before, had fought against God Slayers and prevailed, and Mundus the messenger for the ancient ones hoped this would be enough, otherwise, it would be a repeat of history from a long time ago.

------

Out of all the fights that currently were happening, the whole world was aware of one of them, and that was thanks to the reporter known as AJ, the well known reporter who was filming everything and had just filmed the entrance of the Celestial coming crashing down right where the fountain was.

"What was that bright light that just came in, did the camera break for a second?"

,m "Hey, did you see that lightning barrier that was put up, that was strong, you don't think that Zinon is there do you?"

"No way... wait it would make sense... maybe AJ got a big scoop finally as well."

As the viewers continued to watch, and the light started to fade, the camera's could finally see who had landed.

"I am celestial Hinto and I have come for your head."

The voice was a powerful one that resounded in the whole area. Those that were eating their meals or playing in the area around them, they had all stopped to stare at the white light of energy and then heard this.

What was worse, was the actual appearance of the person that was in front of them, because without a doubt in their minds, this person wasn't human, but they didn't look like any type of beast either, unless it was a humanoid one.

No longer was AJ hiding the fact that he was filming, instead he pulled out his camera and started to pan up and down on the creature, the creature that called itself a celestial.

It had a long, thin, slender body in the shape of a human, but from the bottom, where one would have feet it had types of hooves instead. Going up around its waist it was clothed in a black cloth that seemed to constantly be floating about.

Then there was the body, the most human thing about the creature, with two arms and a normal chest apart from the dark purple skin colour. However, it had horrifying features that made it clear that this was not a human... and in this case, it was its face.

It was narrow and sharp with a pointed chin, as it smiled, black teeth were shown to be as sharp as razors. Two eyes that were narrow slits pointed upward, matching its pointy ears. In the centre there was a red glowing dot right in between its eyes, then coming out from the top of its head were... not horns... but something that seemed to be a part of the body, the same texture as flesh.

They were large, almost like an elephant's trunk, that went up and curved down towards the shoulders as the thickness of them started to thin out.

No one knows why, but just looking at the thing, in person and on the screen, made them all shudder. It was almost as if they were looking at something from a nightmare.

"My whole body is shaking, is anyone else feeling the same thing."

"No way, stop capping, are you serious I have goosebumps as well."

"Me too, are we all just scared?"

"No, I feel nothing looking at that thing, what was it again, a celestial? Probs just some other alien like those damn Dalki!"

AJ's hands were shaking as he was filming the creature for longer and sweat was running down his face for some reason. However, the camera was filming everything just fine due to the stabilization software it had on it.

However, he had made a decision.

"You two, get everyone out of here and clear the area, we can't let that monster take advantage of the people in the area. Quickly send the message out, and for anyone who is watching tell them not to come here and get out of the area!" AJ ordered.

Lucas and Vanessa, the two vampires who had been following Peter due to the large Laxmus that followed him, both thought the same thing. Even though they were vampires... there was something about this creature that made their skin crawl.

"Everyone leave the area! It's dangerous, get out of here, run!" Vanessa started to shout immediately.

Lucas did the same, and all three of them started to run out of the area as well. The people seemed to listen, as they went out of the area. Although the person who had arrived had yet to do anything, everything in their gut was telling them to get out of there.

They had experienced too many bad things to leave it up to chance that this creature was a nice person.

Regardless, there were a few that just locked themselves in the shops that were around the large fountain and square centre, believing they were safe watching what was going to happen next, and it was the same for AJ and the two vampires, as they had entered a building reaching the roof, and was filming from there.

The square was incredibly large in the first place, being around 2 kilometres in length and width. So AJ at least hoped that the fighting wouldn't spread to where they were.

"Am I really that scary?" Hinto said in a deep and resounding voice that shook everyone who heard it. "Fortunately for all of you, I have only come for one person."

Lifting up his hand, it pointed toward Chris of all people. Zinon found this strange because they were on the Graylash planet, so he had assumed that they had come for him.

Out of the celestial named Hinto's hand a dark black sword started to appear. Not just from the one he was holding out, but from both of his hands.

The next moment, Hinto swung the sword and a black line that looked almost like flames was shot through the air, and had immediately hit Chris, sending him flying. The attack had pierced through his chest a centimeter deep and blood was falling from it.

Immediately, Chris started to transform his body as grey fur started to appear all over him and he swung his claws in an x shape to destroy the attack right there and then.

"Oh you managed to stop the attack, and here I thought that I could finish this entire fight in a single strike." Hinto claimed. "You seem to be stronger than the other God Slayer that I have faced, but let's see you win against two strikes!"

While lifting its other hand, a pure lighting bolt shot out in a solidified form hitting the celestial right in its arm before it could lift it. It didn't go through Hinto's hand, but instead was stuck to it, and soon sparks started to go off one after another shocking the creature uncontrollably.

Those watching online, now knew exactly how it was that was there because this was a soul weapon, it was the current leader of the Graylash family's soul weapon.

"This thing stings a bit, and it appears it is slowing down my movements." the celestial said as it swung its hand with the sword. Although to everyone watching the movements didn't seem slowed at all.

"I don't exactly like that guy... but I can tell that you are trouble." Zinon claimed.

"Oh, I wasn't going to hurt you, but be my guest, you can have your lightning bolt back. The sword was dropped to the ground and with his bare hand Hinto had pulled the lightning bolt out.

It was a surprise because the lightning bolt would surely have restricted the person's movements and strength by around fifty percent, yet he seemed to be doing everything just fine, and with the lightning bolt held in his hand he threw it out directly towards Zinon, far faster than it was thrown to him.

Before it reached Zinon though, another black encased hand had reached out and grabbed onto the lightning bolt. Red energy was beaming from his entire body, and the sharp long head tail had appeared.

"I don't like the fact that you're ignoring me... do you think I'm weak. .. B*tch!" Peter shouted as he had transformed fully with his celestial points with both of his arms encased fully in his celestial energy form.

"Hey isn't that the guy from the Chained wedding!"

"Yeah I think it is, I think your right, he's here as well, and he's fighting along with Zinon!"

"Did you just hear what he said, he called that damned monster a Bitch, Kill the ugly Bitch!"

"Oh, this is interesting, a dedicated follower plans to go against me, I guess this really is the land of the arrogant, once I have dealt with you, I will have to have a word with your master." Hinto claimed.

"The last person who said those words, end up as my little pet, and I have room for another one. So bring it on F*cker!" Peter shouted back as he charged in, with Laxmus right by his side as well.

****

# Chapter 1908 The World Battle (Part 2)




Charging in Peter still had the lighting bolt in his hand, and for some reason once again Zinon was surprised that his usual soul weapon effects weren't working at all as Peter was moving at full speed.

This was all due to the special effects of a Wight, they weren't affected by things such as this. It was a special trait of the undead.

Not really knowing what was in his hand, Peter slammed the lightning bolt into Hinto, who raised his sword calmly. Streaks of lightning came out from the lightning bolt hitting the ground around them leaving scorch marks in the process.

"You have great strength, this is a surprise coming from someone who's not on the list." Hinto stated.

"Do you always talk when you're fighting!" Peter moved his head tail, aming to stab right into Hinto's face. However, he moved his head from side to side, up and down, avoiding every single one of the stabs, and eventually the strange trunk-like things he had on his head moved as they wrapped around the head tail, grabbing onto it.

Peter tried to move it, mustering up his strength but it seemed impossible to get the other to let go, but that didn't matter. Because Laxmus was already on the other side, opening up its mouth gathering a deadly red beam of energy.

Something that, for some reason, Laxmus could still do as an undead lesser Wight, was use his red aura powers.

Seeing this, Hinto, went to throw Peter using his head trunk off to the side, causing him to crash into the floor, breaking it apart. It was a strong throw that caused his body to continue to bounce.

The red breath beam attack had been launched and was heading straight for Hinto.

"Let's not waste my own energy on this." Hinto claimed, and rather than use his swords to match the attack, he moved to the side instead.

The red beam attack had completely missed him and instead was going straight toward the buildings that were placed behind.

"The people!" Zinon thought.

Turning his body into a lightning strike, he shot himself into the sky, and then soon landed right in front of the red beam attack. Swinging both his hands, lightning started to gather around them as if he was creating a tornado of lightning.

Then at the right time he shot it out, at the red beam hitting it and breaking the attack in bits causing it to dissipate but it was far stronger than Zinon imagined and although the bulk of the attack had been stopped, there were parts of it that continued and still were still going towards the buildings.

It was then that there were two figures, two vampires who shot out their own blood aura, using blood slashes to hit the remnants of the attack stopping them before they hit the building.

Landing on the ground was Vanessa and Lucas.

"You need to focus on the fight, we… the people, we will protect ourselves. Zinon, just focus on taking that guy down!" Vanessa shouted.

Zinon was surprised because he was still wearing his mask, but he thought it was useless now as he threw the mask to the floor.

'They're right, we need to take out this person together!'

Just then, while Zinon was in the middle of blocking the attack though, Chris had recovered from the initial attack, his scar across his chest had healed, and with both his hands he slammed them down on top of Hinto.

Hinto had lifted both of his swords, but was unable to stop the attack, his knees buckling as the ground cracked throughout the streets beneath him.

Chris's strength was unmatched, and it was even more than the fighting celestial thought.

"This is our chance!" Zinon claimed, as he sped across the floor, speeding up his legs running across, and throwing out a fist of lightning he hit Hinto right in the chest, a great shock, zapping him and sending him across the ground.

Digging his sword into the floor, he soon stopped himself from sliding. But standing behind him, Peter was ready.

"That hurt!" Peter shouted as his hands started to glow, and he whacked Hinto right in the face sending him across back to the other side.

However, Peter noticed something, and it was that his arm had a deep slash on it.

'He must have got me in the middle of that attack.'

Still, the slash was healing, as it always did, with Peter. Perhaps it was due to his own celestial energy inside him that the wounds weren't having as much trouble healing as he thought they would.

Laxmus started to use his wings to float and fly in the air, and while doing so, several red beams of energy were shot at Hinto. Since they were from above there was less risk of the attacks straying off course and going into the crowd.

Using the two swords, the celestial continued to hit the beams of energy, as it swung its sword, black energy flowed out from the celestial and was able to completely destroy the red aura that was created from Laxmus.

A lightning streak had come from the side, but slamming the black sword in the ground, black flames rose blocking the attack, and soon Hinto could see that Chris was heading his way towards him once again, with his arms and body covered in fur.

His two claws slashed and were thrown out, but they had just clashed against the swords. As soon as Chris's attacks were blocked though, he began to swipe, again and again, relentlessly he threw his hands one after another.

Loud clashes were coming out, vibrations were sent through the air breaking windows in the distance and parts of weak housing structures to fall. The clashes continued and Chris was getting faster with his attacks but still none of them were going through.

'I'm not weaker in terms of strength, but he must be faster than me, otherwise how is he stopping everything!'

It was then that Chris felt one of his hands hit nothing but air, it hadn't clashed against the sword like it usually would have and a deep cut was made across his chest.

"You think I care about something like this!" Chris shouted as he continued to swing his arms despite the cut, throwing them out again, making the whole area vibrate as the sword was clashing against his claws.

Since the attacks were hitting nothing else but each other it was hard to tell how much power was behind the attacks but, Chirs's fists were capable of destroying mountains.

However, just like before there were times where Chirs felt like his hands were slipping off or slipping to the side, and that's because Hinto was incredibly skilled with the sword.

In fact, it wasn't that Hinto was equal in strength compared to Chris, he was wrong about that part, it was that at the right time the energy could be deflected away just enough to it felt like the attack was being blocked.

Once in a while, Hinto could completely guess where the attack was coming from and avoid it, allowing him to perform another strike and cut Chris. Now he had several cuts on him within a time of a few seconds as well.

'I can't keep doing the same thing, my body has good healing… but eventually I will wear out and lose just like I did against Quinn!' Chris thought as his strike missed again and rather than going for a slash, it looked like Hinto was going for a stab instead right towards Chris's chest.

"Did you forget about me!" Peter shouted as his head tail, and his two fists slammed into the sword at the same time, hitting it away, and immediately, Peter went for a punch and attacked towards the celestial again.

A slash from the sword went upward, and Hinto thought he was safe, because Peter would try to avoid the sword slash, but instead he continued throwing out his fists and as the sword went through his arm, slicing it completely off, and dropping it to the floor.

It was only Peter's hand though, and before the sword could slash towards his body again, this time Chris was there holding onto the sword with his clawed hand.

Then with the stump of his injured hand which was practically only a stump. Peter threw it out again hitting Hinto right in the face, leaving a blood mark across it and sending him across the floor again.

"Even if I just have my F*cking head, I'll still beat you!" Peter shouted as he picked up his hand off the floor, and placed it on the wound, healing it up.

Chris's arm was healing as well, and before Hinto could even strike again, both Laxmus and Zinon fired out lighting and blood aura at his position attempting to finish him off, and attack him while he's hurt.

"That guy… he didn't care even that his hand got blasted off!"

"He's like a Zombie or something, I think he just re-attached his hand. I just can't help but root for him."

People watching the fight had their hopes on the group, who seemed to be doing well, but they had to admit, one person was clearly taking on four greats, so they knew the power of this celestial well.

" He will be coming out of that… but I have a plan." Chris said. "Me and you are going to have to work together a bit, and I'm going to need you to trust me okay."

Peter didn't care, he would do anything just to win this fight, and that's when he noticed Chris's form started changing, from his Werewolf self into something else, and it wasn't his human body.

# Chapter 1909 The World Battle (Part 3)




Since there were many things going on in the celestial space all at once, the attention of the celestials was divided amongst those that were fighting against the God Slayers.

At the same time, some of the celestials just weren't interested in what was happening. Over the course of time, things like this happened before. They came and went and then there were those that would make a big deal over what was going on.

On top of that they had their normal duties to attend to, planets that they kept careful eyes on. However, there were two celestials that were more interested in the things going on, more so compared to others, and that was Xox and Yongbu.

"I thought just BB was strong but it looks like there are plenty of strong people from Earth, what has happened? Surely we should have known about such a dangerous solar system before it got to this point." Yongbu asked.

"That's the thing, the Earthlings have just been put through a lot lately, due to their own mistakes and in order to get themselves out of the situation they were in, they had to evolve to this point, and besides I'm pretty sure that the dedicated follower isn't one that belongs to Bliss or Immortui, otherwise they would have never fought against Hinto."

Yongbu turned to his celestial ball friend, since he was slightly confused, although he knew dedicated followers didn't tend to harm other celestials. However, the way Xox said those words, it was more so like he wouldn't dare to attack someone like Hinto.

"I can tell you're confused, but the background of Hinto is more mysterious when compared to any of the other celestials that were sent out on the attack." Xox explained.

Now Youngbu was intrigued, because when watching the celestial fight he was wondering why there was a chill that he could feel around him, and of course Xox was happy to explain. In fact he was waiting for someone to be interested.

"You see, Hinto is not originally from the same place as us. He is from the red celestial space."

If Xox could see Yongbu's eyes, they would have lit up immensely.

"He is that high of a celestial? But if he can travel between spaces then how come I have never heard of him?"

The red celestial space was another name for the celestials that were on another plain, another dimension compared to the rest of the celestials. They had the same planets, there was Earth and other planets, but these beings usually were unable to interact with each other.

The familiar world was one example of another space, called the mystic space. As for the red space, it was known to be an incredibly cruel and brutal place, even between celestials.

"You should know the stories of those from the red space. The creatures that live there are ones that are unmatched when compared to our space."

"Which is why any celestial that is known to come from that space is also known to be strong just to survive." Youngbu mumbled and now also understood why he got a strange feeling when looking at Hinto.

It was the difference in energy, the aura around said person, it was something that one wasn't used to. Technically it was still the same energy but it almost had a different flavour to it.

"I still don't understand, I know that some celestials can travel between the plains, but that is either due to the celestial themselves, or due to the level of the celestial, but Hinto was not at that level… if he was, I would have heard of him." Yongbu replied.

"You are correct, but the truth is that Hinto was pulled out of the red space and brought into this one." Xox stated. "Not many people know about this, but of course you are talking to the number one information gatherer in the celestial space right now.

"Hinto was in a bit of trouble in the red space and he was able to contact one of the ancient ones. In order for them to help pull him out of the red space, he agreed to do their bidding. Now Hinto works under them doing whatever they ask. He has done quite a few tasks like this for them before, but it just has never been publicized in a way like this."

After hearing all of this, Yongbu started to think more about the red space. He hadn't really met many celestials from there and for good reason, there just weren't many that had the ability to travel between spaces.

Even if they did, sometimes they could enter the space but were unable to use the white balls of energy to travel to the places that they needed to go.

In fact, at times Yongbu had heard rumours that if there were celestials that were difficult to deal with, or caused too much trouble, that the ancient ones would get involved and send them to the red space.

At the end of the day, the ancient ones were the ones that were there from the beginning, the overseers of all the spaces. They all knew this, even though Yongbu had never seen one in person.

"Anyway, the point is, even though those idiots are strong from Earth, Hinto will be no easy match for them."

———

After the endless attacks from Laxmus and from Zinon had stopped, smoke had appeared around the area. The camera from AJ zoomed in waiting for the result, as the smoke started to fade away… they could still see the figure still standing there completely fine.

Even the clothes on Hinto seemed to be unhurt, and the swords were still held in its hands.

"Do you have any idea how many battles I have been through?" Hinto said as the red crystal in between his eyes started to light up. Both of his swords were now covered in the balck flames.

"Battle after battle after battle in that place, and I won every single one of them. Today, this will be the same, I will win this battle as well, because following them and not having to fight every second of my life is far better than my old life."

Swinging his sword upright, a large wall of fire had been raised as tall as an apartment building. It had sliced everything in its path including the buildings on the outskirts, setting aflame everything that it touched. They continued to burn, not growing larger or smaller but staying in place.

There were screams and cries as some had been hit by the attack, and those that had been, their life was slowly fading away until it was nothing.

Eventually, Hinto lowered his sword and the flames disappeared and looked like they had gone back into his weapon, and that's when he noticed that his attack hadn't hit his target.

"Where did the two annoying ones go?" Hinto asked.

During the fight, Hinto had noticed that after all of his attacks, those two in particular, had some type of super-healing ability that allowed them to continue on fighting.

So he needed to increase the strength in the power he was drawing from himself to finish them. It had been awhile since he had to fight like this, had to fight this hard, which just proved what type of opponents these two were.

Turning his head quickly, he could hear the sound of something, it flashed in his vision, and he turned again trying to keep track of it. Until eventually he could see it coming straight towards him at a great speed.

It pounced, shoving its two claws right into Hinto, pushing him down on the ground and now Hinto could see what it was.

On top of him was what looked like a large grey-furred wolf. Not a werewolf but a full sized wolf. The sheer speed of the attack had caused Hinto to fall back, and before he knew it, he had been stabbed right in his shoulder as well, because on top of the wolf was none other than the dedicated follower Peter.

"Looks like you do bleed, and there is a lot more where that's coming from." Peter smirked as he and Chris was doing something they had never done before.
