# Chapter 1870 Re: Return of a legend (Part 2)

The others were in such disbelief when they saw the person in front of them that they thought they were dreaming. Quinn had gone missing for a while now, long enough that they assumed it might be years for him to return.

Or, if they really wanted to find Quinn, then they would have to find him himself. The only thing was, they had no idea how determined Quinn was to get back to Earth and return to the others to see if they were okay.

When Quinn saw the large ship, he had no clue what it was or who it belonged to, but he could sense that Peter was using his celestial energy now. The amount used was increased, and without a doubt, he was fighting.

Because of this, he didn't slow down as he busted through the many levels of the ship, following the energy like a red arrow. Quinn used his red aura to easily bash through the levels one by one until he eventually landed in front of the others.

'My guess was right, they're here, and it looks like they're in the middle of a tough battle.' Quinn thought as he could see Peter had transformed. And then he turned around, only to find partially-transformed Chris.

'This has to be related to Pure. So they were fighting against Chris up till this moment?' Quinn wondered. 'It seems like he's going easy on them since this is not his full transformation. Last time, I struggled, but I have been through a lot compared to that, and this time, the outcome won't be the same.'

Immediately, shadows covered both of Quinn's wings, turning into solid forms. At the same time, he activated his soul weapon, and the twin chains caused blood to trickle down his forearms. As the blood dropped on the floor, Quinn wasn't letting it go to waste.

While keeping the chest piece on, he started to harden the celestial blood that was oozing out of his body. He created a pair of leg pieces that turned and twirled, looking like an image of a ram's horns on his knees.

He also created shoulder pads in a similar fashion, having the indentation of flags on both of them. Then finally, the soul weapons themselves started to glow a bright red, changing their form into the deadly gauntlets he had used.

'He has the power of a Werewolf in him. Their physical strength is great. I could fight him at a distance using my blood skills and more, but I don't need to do that, and it's a lot more satisfying throwing out a punch.'

Using his blood control and his speed to the max, Quinn moved his body as fast as he could to where Chris was standing. Following Quinn was a red aura that was so large that it encased the entire room. And the others felt a chill as they sensed the massive amounts of energy.

Quinn's fist landed right on Chris's chest, and he could no longer be seen, instead, there was a large ceiling, around ten metres tall and ten metres wide, right above where he once stood. Upon looking through the hole though, one could see the sky, as the attack had gone right through the entire ship.

'I'm learning how to use my celestial power to power myself up even more.' Quinn thought. 'But I still have a number of things I have yet to try out. The reason why I thought for so long, and trained so hard, was because of this. I don't want my enemies to hurt those I care about ever again!'

"That won't be enough to kill him. He's a god slayer after all." Quinn said as he flew through the whole off in the distance.

Flying through the air, Chris was eventually descending, and there was a large fist mark on his body, and the internal wound had injured him as blood split from his mouth.

'That really hurt… he's gotten so much stronger in such a short amount of time. But I should expect no less from someone like him.' Chris thought.

Turning his head, he could see a small island that was mostly rocks and void of plant life and more. Just before he landed, Chris's entire body began to change. His snout grew slightly larger, his teeth started to elongate, grey fur covered him from head to toe, and his huge build had turned even more muscular.

The internal wounds inside of his body were starting to heal. Finally landing and skidding across the surface, Chris had fully transformed himself, and he could see something coming toward him in the distance.

As it got closer, he could make out that it was. It was a giant red blood spear. Chris instantly started to run forward on all fours, and just as the spear was about to hit him, he leapt up in the air and grabbed it.

Immediately, he felt intense pain in his hands, and the veins all over his body began to tense. Then spinning around, Chris threw the red spear back, right where it came from.

"It looks like you're not here to talk this time," Chris said.

"You're right." He heard a reply from above, and upon raising his head, he saw a shadow portal. Quinn suddenly came out of it and threw his fist. He slammed Chris's head right into the ground, making the whole island tremble. "I'm not."

———

Back in the laboratory, the others were in shock and still at a loss for words at what had exactly occurred. They had seen Quinn appear out of nowhere, and then suddenly, he had disappeared like that. It was almost as if the whole thing was a dream.

"Oh… what's this? You look a bit different from the last time I saw you?" Sil said, and this was directed toward Peter mainly.

It took a while as Peter looked at the person who was speaking, the one that had come with Quinn. The face instantly reminded him of someone, Hilston, but that was impossible, and they didn't look exactly like each other. There were just many similarities.

"I see you are struggling to remember, but it's Sil." Sil smiled. "I never did get to thank you in person for the items you helped me back then, Peter. I was a different person back then."

Peter was so speechless that he cancelled his transformation then and there. He walked closer, wondering what circumstances could have occurred that led Sil, the person in front of him, to be with Quinn, the one they were looking for.

"I don't understand how…how are you here, and how did you find Quinn?" Peter asked.

A lot of the others were interested as well and wanted to know his story, but they could soon hear footsteps and people shouting while heading their way.

"I would love to tell you all and introduce myself to Quinn's new friends. However, it looks like you guys were a bit busy here." Sil said. "Maybe we should get rid of this problem first before we get rid of the other problem."

Hearing this, everyone snapped back into reality.

"Wait!" Jessica shouted. "What about Quinn?"

"Oh, you don't have to worry about him," Sil replied. "He is an even bigger monster than he was before, compared to when you last met him. I doubt there is anyone on Earth that could take him on."

Muka began to shake her head at the situation.

"That's not the problem," Muka replied. "Chris, the one that Quinn is fighting, has just agreed to join our side. He was helping us, not fighting us."

A large smile appeared on Seal's face. He couldn't believe what he was hearing.

"That's quite funny, it looks like he's doing the same thing as me, and he was the one who called me hot-headed. Anyway, don't worry, it will all work out…I hope."

# Chapter ﻿1871 Around the world

The others in the group were still unsure who exactly the new people who had come along with Quinn were. Still, it didn't matter too much, as more enemies could be seen coming from the entrance of the lab, and just like before, some of them were pulling a huge Qi cannon, and everyone also had Qi guns as well.

These enemies also carried a few more weapons they hadn't come across against the previous bunch. A few had a couple of large square-shaped shields, and just like the Qi gun, it looked like it was creating a shield purely out of Qi.

"Well, well, well, this is quite interesting. I am not surprised to see many things have changed since the last time I came here," Sil remarked while looking at the weapons with curiosity.

"Watch out for that canon!" Jessica shouted, warning him about the weapon's immense power, but by the time she finished her sentence, the man had long left and was already standing on the other side of the room and holding the now crushed tip of the cannon up in the air.

"You should really try and focus on improving on yourself, rather than using weapons like this." Sil let out a fake sigh of disappointment.

Then shaking his head, he raised his hand and instantly, all of the weapons, including the shields, were snatched from the enemy's hands and began to float in the air.

"This is…is it the power of Telekinesis!" Lucia was surprised.

"So cool! All the weapons are flying." Minny pointed out. This was her first time seeing such a thing, and she felt amazed to witness something like this.

Sil moved his arm, and all the weapons were thrown to the side of the room. Before anyone could react, he lifted all the thirty or so men who had entered the room off their feet and raised them in the air.

"How… I've never seen someone who has such a strong power like this before. Who can do something like this? I wonder who he is," Jessica thought out loud.

"Well, he is a friend of Quinn's, and Quinn does seem to know some powerful people," Mitchell commented.

"Don't kill them!" Muka suddenly shouted, remembering Chris' request.

Hearing this, Sil kissed his teeth and dropped the men to the ground. Loud thuds resonated, and they began to hear a few cries of pain from the other side of the room. Fortunately for them, it wasn't at a height that would lead to any severe injury.

"Fine, so I can't kill them, but I will definitely make it so they can't follow us for a while," Sil said, and suddenly, both hands started to glow blue. Then, thin lightning strikes began to form after a moment, jumping from one finger to the next and so on.

"This…is the power of the Graylash family." Lucia blurted. She could spot something like this from a mile away, considering she herself was from the Graylash family and seeing what he had done before it had clicked in her head. "This person, he's definitely from the Blade family, but who is he?"

On the other hand, after saying these words, Sil released the lightning by touching the floor. It instantly started to crawl like a thousand spiders on the ground towards the prey closest to them, and when lightning touched one of the men, it began to give them consecutive non-stop shocks. The whole area slowly lit up in blue light, and more cries of pain began to come out of the men's mouths.

"I'm not too sure if they wish they were killed right now." Jessica shook her head, finding it hard to even look at those being fried right in front of their eyes, but eventually, Sil put the lightning punishment to a stop.

"Finally, now no one will interrupt us." Sil nodded, "My guess is the next lot of people won't be here for another five minutes, or they are protecting the other places. They can't just keep sending people down here, right? And it looks like you've already taken quite a few before we even arrived."

Peter shook his head hearing these words.

"You always have to show off, don't you." Peter then walked up to Sil, and when the two of them were in front of each other and with a few metres of distance between them, he requested, "Fight me."

Sil chuckled upon hearing the request.

"Are you serious, Peter? We have only just met, and you guys seem to be in the middle of doing something right now, and this is the first thing you say?"

"I want to see who is stronger of the two of us, so why don't you fight me right now?" Peter repeated.

"Is this really the right place and time?!" Lucia frowned, shaking her head. "The two of you can fight at any time later, Peter. It doesn't have to be now. Chris has asked us to do something, so we should complete it, get off this place and get to both Chris and Quinn before their fight goes out of hand."

Peter continued to stare at Sil with his fists clenched. The two didn't have a hatred for each other, but after growing in strength, in leaps and bounds, Peter was satisfied with second place. After waking up from his slumber, he believed that Quinn was at the top, and then he was just below Quinn. There wasn't anyone else stronger than him.

However, it wasn't long after when he encountered Erin, against whom he couldn't do much. This had frustrated him, and now, another powerful guy was in front of him, which frustrated him even more. Although there were those like Chris and Zero, Peter didn't know their strength, and in his head, he could beat them anyway.

"I don't want to be fourth," Peter commented.

"Well, I'm not going to fight you," Sil replied.

Eventually, Peter felt someone grab him around the arm and could see the others had gathered and were walking towards him. Seeing the person who was grabbing him was Lucia, for some reason, his anger started to reside, and he was happy to at least wait until the matter at hand gets resolved.

"I didn't get to introduce myself to you all last time, but my name is Sil Blade. I haven't been back on Earth in a while, so I doubt I have met you guys before or you have heard of me." Sil said to the group.

It was true. Most of those that were there didn't know his name. Although Sil was a legendary name to the Blade family, to the others, he was just another Blade, but seeing his powers, they knew he wasn't just another blade.

"It's nice to meet you as well," Jessica replied, and the group introduced themselves to Sil.

It was a bit weird since just a moment ago, they were all fighting as if their lives were on the line. And now they were completely at peace, and because Sil was so confident, it had made them all grow with confidence as well.

On top of that, Ceril had also introduced herself to them all, not really explaining to them all who she was, but in her current form, she looked just like any other human.

'Her scent, it's quite strange. I've never smelled anything like it before. She certainly isn't a human, but why does she remind me of a vampire?' Muka wondered, incredibly confused.

After the introductions, they explained a little bit about where they were and what was happening around here. They hadn't explained the whole Erin background story because they didn't have time and thought that it would need to be told when Quinn was here as well, to see if he had any thoughts behind it.

"I see, but then we don't know what Agent 4 plans to do with the Red Heart. Did you say that was his lab right behind you?" Sil asked.

The others nodded. They had already destroyed most of the equipment, but Agent 4's lab was still somewhat untouched as that was when the enemies began to arrive.

"Before we go and destroy all of these things, maybe there is a way we can find out where they went and what they know about the red heart," Sil said.

Confused looks on people's faces were seen, but that's when a book appeared in Sil's hand. Finally, after changing his ability, he seemed ready.

"I just need to remember where it was….oh, that's right," Sil added, with a smile on his face. "I will be right back."

A large circular portal suddenly opened up in the air, and stepping through it, Sil disappeared. The others waited in wonder what he was doing, and around a minute or so later, the same portal opened once again, and Sil stepped out.

"Sorry, I just needed to pay a little visit. It seemed he was a bit shocked," Sil said as he pulled something out of the portal and placed them on his side.

"That… that's Logan Green!" Jessica pointed in shock.

"Yeah, I think he is the man for the job."

*******

# Chapter 1872 Vampire Vs Werewolf (Part 1)

The others continued to blink as they continued to see people they never thought they would see on the Pure base right here. Somehow, one way or another, Logan was in front of them. None of them had been given a portable teleport for Logan to use, so they could only guess one thing, it was an ability that the Blade had.

'How… is that possible?' Lucia thought. 'Even if he did use an ability, a teleportation of some kind, Green City is thousands and thousands of miles away. How would anyone have the MC cells to make a trip there and come back.'

This was possible of course, because it was Sil, a person who had been increasing the amount of MC cells he could use for a long time, and that was exactly what he had done. When meeting Logan Green, even Logan himself was stunned.

However, explaining how the situation was pretty tense at the moment, Sil had only given a brief introduction, and had stated that Quinn was back as well. After that, Logan said that there was no need for him to say anymore, and would come with him telling him what he needed to do.

"I know this isn't what any of us expected. Honestly, I tried to predict a good amount of outcomes, and although I thought a fight would occur, I never thought that Quinn would come back in the middle of it, nor that Chris would choose to switch sides." Logan stated.

"Alright, no need to explain yourself," Sil replied. "All of you with Peter should be enough, but go ahead and take out the men at those facilities. Don't destroy everything, because we want Logan here to steal all the data they have. What is theirs will now become ours?

"In the meantime, me and Logan are going to try to find out what Agent 4 was doing in his lab. I will be here to protect Logan so don't worry about us, and if you need help, just shout really loud."

After seeing what Sil could do they had confidence in leaving them, and that's what they did, as they wished to complete the task before it got even more serious. Who knew, maybe a report was already sent out to Zero, and he was already on his way back.

Ceril had stayed with Sil, and the three of them headed to Agent 4's lab. It was time for Logan to do his stuff as he pressed both of his hands on the console, trying to get as much information as he could.

'I see, so there are a lot of protective barriers that you have created to try and stop my ability, but unfortunately for you. I am able to do things you could never imagine Agent 4.' Logan smiled to himself.

Information was flooding into his head, and after a couple of minutes only, he had let go.

"Those guys, they have the vampire armour, the one that Richard Eno was using."

"The one that was used on Blade island that Quinn talked about?" Sil replied. "Does that mean Pure were there that day? Were they working with Jim Eno as well?"

It seemed like a possibility, but there was no information about that day. Only the fact that they had been running tests on the blood armor and that they still had it.

"I… also know what they plan to use the Red Heart for," Logan said.

——

From the get-go, after the fight that had occurred last time, Quinn knew that he couldn't go easy or pull any punches when fighting against Chris. He felt the strength from last time. This person was a bigger threat than Graham.

The strikes were more powerful, the healing capabilities were better, they were faster, and stronger at the same time. Which was why Quinn had used shadow overload on himself to drop down and bash both of his fists like a hammer straight on top of Chris's head.

His whole body had been slammed into the ground, but just as quickly as he had been hit, Chris came up swiping in the air. Leaning back the claws had missed Quinn's face by a few inches, but soon after a powerful strike had come out from them.

Quinn swiped both of his hands as fast as possible, using his hands in a claw-like shape, and ripped through the claw strikes, breaking them apart. Straight after seeing Chris in front of him, he kicked him right in the chest and a flow of red aura was blasted into Chris as it sent him across the floor.

The ground was kicked up so heavily behind him, that it looked like a mountain of dirt had been created. Not giving him any time to rest though, Chris noticed that there were two shadows right next to where he was.

'What is happening… Was Quinn always this strong? Is he going to come through one of these?' Chris thought.

However, that wasn't the case at all, Quinn had used his soul weapon to change his gauntlets once again into the twin blade chains and he chucked them through two more shadows that were next to him, and immediately they went to where Chris was.

Using blood control, Quinn was even able to control the twin blade chains without having to swing them a certain way. Immediately they wrapped around and dug into Chris's arm. Twisting around them and contracting them in place.

'What are these things, I can't block them from entering my body with my Qi, the energy is different from what I've faced before. Ah… screw it, it just means I'm going to have to win with raw power.'

Despite the chains digging deeper into Chris's werewolf body, and his blood dripping onto the floor, he ignored all of that as he howled into the air, and began to run forward.

Due to the chains still being linked to Quinn. Suddenly, Quinn felt his whole body being pulled forward towards his two shadows in front of him. He tried to pull back but it seemed impossible, so instead he changed the shape and form of his soul weapon back into the gauntlets again.

Seeing Chris have a speed boost, Quinn went to close his shadow wings to block the attack or redirect it back. The only thing was, Chris was fast, extremely fast. He had already gotten past Quinn's wings and now was directly in front of him. Throwing out both of his clawed hands in an X shape, it had ripped the demon tier armour that the vampire celestial was wearing in seconds.

The shadow on his wings disappeared, and the chest piece had fallen onto the floor. Right across Quinn's chest, blood squirted out in a large X shape, and he was sent flying back.

Quinn remained standing but the clawed X shape was still across his chest, bleeding and falling to the ground.

'I guess I was wrong to think I could beat you in a physical fight." Quinn stated. "But I'm still going to try anyway."

The blood that was around his chest started to harden, and a celestial blood armour had been made with a similar design to that on his shoulder. Around the pectoral chest bit there were twirls that looked like horns, and on the abdominal part of the chest piece, there were fangs that looked like the teeth of the vampire.

Finally though, one hand continued to glow red, and with it there looked to be a gauntlet like he had on before, but a large scythe in his hand. While the other was solidified shadows. The entire of Quinn's left arm was a dark purple that went right up to his elbow and started to trail off.

Chris didn't know why, but his instincts seemed to be telling him that this shadow hand was something that he needed to be careful of.

"I'm not sure how well this will work on someone like you, but if I want to stop this, and to continue to protect the Earth, then I need to improve every aspect of myself, no matter what different types of enemies I face!"

*****

# Chapter ﻿1873 Vampire Vs Werewolf (Part 2)

For a long time, Quinn had been focusing on his blood powers, his celestial powers and more, trying to figure out the different ways he could use them. Since he couldn't exert his celestial powers properly, it left him with no choice but to use his powers in a physical sense. That led him to improve his hand to hand and close quarter combat abilities.

Fighting with blood aura was handy when fighting against multiple enemies at once, but it just didn't cut it when he was fighting a strong enemy like Athos. In the future, there was a possibility that Quinn would be going up against someone like Athos without Sil around.

If that was the case, then Quinn needed to figure out some other aspect that he could evolve, and while creating his own space he had mainly focused on improving his shadow powers.

'The shadow power is meant to be a god slayer ability, but it has never felt like that, but Arthur… he had created a lot of the moves, and even created the Shadow Eater skill to punish vampires. Which means there are more ways to use the shadow… I just needed to learn them.' Quinn thought.

In his hand, it looked like a condensed form of the shadow, but it wasn't, as it was constantly shifting somewhat similar to his shadow body. When using shadow overload and fighting with his shadow body, the shadow had slightly different properties and Quinn had decided to explore this.

On the other side, Chris was cautious of these new types of weapons he hadn't seen before, so he decided to attack from further away, getting up close only when he needed to. Swinging out his arms constantly, Chris sent out slashes through the air one after the other.

Seeing this, Quinn then got his scythe ready, and started to spin it, slashing through the attacks and breaking them one after another. After breaking the initial series, Quinn moved to the side and had gathered a red ball of aura in his left hand where the shadow was, and threw it out towards Chris.

Chris could tell that this was an explosive and powerful attack and he whacked it away covering his hand with Qi into the air. A few seconds later, the red aura had exploded in the air, dyeing the sky red for a few seconds.

However, that was just to allow Quinn to get close as he was already by his side swinging the scythe towards his side. Moving quicker than Quinn, Chris had grabbed the back edge thinking he had stopped it, but he hadn't at all.

The soul weapon blood scythe had the ability to use the blood forest, in fact all of Quinn's blood armour could. Blood moved from the scythe and hardened into several spikes shooting out to hit Chris straight in the head.

Using his great strength, that outmatched Quinn's, he pushed the scythe upward which moved the small hardened blood trails, but they were still going towards him. At the same time, Quinn slammed his foot into the ground, and blood aura filled the cracks.

Knowing something was up, Chris quickly leapt up in the air and threw Quinn's scythe into the ground. Blood had risen from the ground in the form of little spikes and branches as the blood forest attack was used, but it had hit nothing.

While in the air, Quinn had changed the Scythe into a spear and threw it towards Chris. Seeing this before, Chris was ready to grab it once again and throw it back, but while it was mid air, its shape started to change, and it began to form into almost a deadly tornado. It reached the clouds turning them red as well.

The next second the entire tornado had engulfed Chris's body. Constantly he was being hit by attacks that were similar to that of the blood swipe from all over. He was unable to fall down as his body was being hit from below and everywhere was being ripped to shreds.

As fast as he was being cut and hurt though, his body was keeping up with the healing process as well.

As the anger started to rise in Chris, and the pain started to build up, he just began to attack the tornado. Swinging his arms out, creating breaks in the red attack, but it soon healed up.

'I need to move faster, I need to attack harder!' Chris thought in his head, as he continued to swing, he was slowly getting faster. His movements were breaking up more of the tornado that seemed invincible, and he didn't have to worry about the attack because it didn't hurt him at all.

Lifting both of his hands, Chris struck beneath him and the entire tornado had disappeared. What Chris didn't expect was that right after the tornado had disappeared, Quinn was already directly in front of him, with one red gauntlet soul weapon hand and one shadow hand.

The red armour was no longer on his body, and he had switched to his demon tier blue fang set.

[Nitro accelerate activated]

'Just for a moment, I need to be faster than you.' Quinn thought, as he already had thrown out his fist, and had punched Chris in the stomach. As soon as he had hit Chris once, he continued to hit Chris again and again, all over his body.

As he did this, shadows were being left on Chris's body, attached to him, as if they were small fires that were burning on his body. Quinn didn't stop punching as he threw hit after hit constantly on him.

"You think your weak punches can do anything!" Chris shouted as he threw his own fist, sending Quinn back down to the ground. A loud bang was heard and had rippled the air several times, and less than a second later another bang was heard as Quinn had crashed into the ground and sunken into it.

"You have a lot of tricks up your sleeve, and your very versatile with all your powers," Chris said, as he landed back on the floor. "But that means nothing when you are fighting against someone who is faster, smarter, and is all around just better than you."

Crashing up through the ground, Quinn came out with his armour crumbling to pieces and falling to the ground. The blue fang set had lasted him a long time. He knew it was a risk using it in this fight, and with someone like Chris that it possibly would be destroyed.

The other demon tier chest piece had been destroyed but had a passive effect of healing itself again if it was damaged, but that wasn't true for the blue fang set. It was practically useless now, and was to be lost forever.

'Helen the gift that you had given me has saved me more times than I could ever count, and it's true to that now. I'm sorry I never really appreciated your feelings at the time, and I'm sorry I never really got to say thank you to you.

'But, just like all those other times before, your gift has not been wasted.'

Quinn held out his shadow hand, and pointed it towards Chris from a distance. All over Chris's body, there were still parts of the shadow on him, he was currently more shadow on his front than his actual body.

"I don't know if you have ever felt fear before," Quinn asked. "But I guarantee that you will feel it now."

Twisting his hand, the shadow all over Chris's body started to expand and spread. The small dots had attached to each other and started to grow rapidly.

Chris tried to use his Qi to fight it off, he even started to punch his own body trying to get the shadow off him, but he was unable to do anything. Then finally, all of the dots of shadow had been connected and the entirety of Chris's body was covered in shadow, and there was only a shadow body of Chris that could be seen.

'What happened… I can't see anything… I can't hear anything, or taste or smell... All of my senses have completely disappeared.'

*****

# Chapter 1874 Finishing the job

The data had revealed a big truth, and Logan was left in disbelief. After raiding Agent Four's lab, he had come to know what Pure was attempting to do with the Red Heart.

'This is…with all of Richard's data that I have, this could be possible, but why would they attempt to do such a thing? If people thought what the Red vampires were attempting to do was bad, this was much worse than that.'

"Will you just spill it out already rather than staring into space?" Sil eventually couldn't hold himself back, "You're starting to freak me out a bit."

Logan didn't say anything because he wondered how he could not catch what the Pure was planning to do sooner. In a way, he was kicking himself in the foot and couldn't believe he was working with Pure in an attempt to track the Red Heart down.

What would've happened if Logan did find the Red heart and gave it to Pure? He would have been an accomplice!

"Sil, you haven't been around, so you don't understand," Logan replied. "For one, judging by the data, Pure now has the Red Heart. Second, I thought if the Dhampirs were to get such a thing, they would have attempted to destroy it, but instead, they have given it to Pure...and what they plan to do…"

"Look, does it really matter?" Sil replied. "Right now, we have Quinn fighting out there, not to mention you even have me. And they haven't done anything yet, so there is still time to stop them. So let's deal with the rest of this and get to Quinn without wasting any time!"

In the end, Sil was right. Although, maybe because Sil wasn't involved in the events of Earth for a long time, he didn't really know the worry Logan had. Still, perhaps it was a perspective the latter needed as well because the problems that Earth faced were small compared to the Universal problems out there.

Pressing a few things on his arm, the self-built armour that Logan was wearing started to change slightly. Rather than the usual spiders that Sil was used to seeing, it reformed and turned into something else. It looked like the suit of armour was just extending up his neck and covering his entire face.

In the end, he looked like a superhero wearing a complete suit to hide his identity. A metallic blue over his entire body with a slight solid green where his eyes and mouth would be.

"What is that for?" Sil asked.

"I have to hide," Logan replied. "In the first place, I sent these people to apologize for what was happening. If the people see me and know I was part of the attack, it will cause many problems. We must be careful with what we do. We cannot afford to appear in a bad light when Pure's public image is quite possible at its best."

Sil walked over to Logan and suddenly grabbed the latter's arm.

"Oh, well, you don't have to worry about that because they're not going to see us anyway."

Logan stared at the hold, and without explaining anything, Sil used his Blink ability. The next moment, they disappeared from the lab and reappeared a floor above. Now they were in some type of cleaning area or part of the lab's ventilation.

"Just hold on. I will quickly get us to where we need to be." Sil said with confidence.

"Wait, I understand you're using the teleporting ability, but you don't know the ship's layout. How do you know where we're going?" Logan asked, worried they would suddenly go into the ship engine room or an incinerator.

"I'm listening to the noise, I can hear everything each time we stop, so I have a good guess of where to go. They said that there are three palaces, and we have gotten rid of one, so let's finish this up quickly."

After several jumps through the ship and following the noise of the people running around everywhere, it was actually very easy for Sil to figure out where they needed to go. Eventually, they ended up at the very top deck of the place.

"It sounds like there is something underneath," Sil said. "But I thought I would enjoy the fresh air for a bit and see how Quinn is doing."

Looking out in the distance, Sil couldn't see the two of them, so he imagined they had to have been blasted off quite in the distance. Still, he could sense strong energy far off.

'Chris is a lot stronger than I thought.' Sil thought. 'Is he like me? Has he surpassed what a human can achieve? But how is that possible? How did he do it? Unless he has been absorbing energy from Nest crystals like me, or maybe it's something else?'

Either way, the good news was that he deduced that Quinn was doing okay from a large amount of energy he could sense. Only if the energies started to fade would he have to worry.

"Let's get to work," Sil said. He jumped up and reached a great height in the air, right above the large ship Rein. Then, he started to tail his body, and as he did, flames started to spiral right above. There were some people that were outside on board the deck seeing this.

"What is that? Is it a Phenix?!" Someone shouted while pointing at the incoming flame enveloped Sil.

The flames had certainly made the shape of a giant phoenix in the sky so enormous that they couldn't even see the small human within it.

"Don't hurt the people or destroy the ship, right…this should be okay." Sil thought.

The large flame Phenix started to dive down and head straight to the ship. It was flying down at a fast speed. The next second, he changed his ability, switching to the one he had used before: Blink.

Teleporting through at the last second, Sil and the flames of the phoenix had instantly disappeared and had gone right to the floor below the top one on the deck. Logan, still standing on the top deck, began to feel the entire surface below his feet heating up, and the whole ship shook.

The end of the large ship had tipped slightly into the sea and soon started to balance out. However, as soon as Logan regained his balance, he found Sil standing in front of him again.

"Alright, I didn't destroy the ship. It seems I have quite good control now." Sil commented. "Anyway, let's head to the next place."

"Did you forget something?" Logan asked. "I was meant to get information from each lab. That's why you told me to come with you."

Soul didn't say anything, and sweat trickled down his forehead. He had gotten carried away at that moment.

"It shouldn't affect us too much, right? I destroyed everything in there, so it will be hard for them to use anything. Let's go."

The two of them blinked away, heading for the next place.

The rest of the group, along with Muka, had travelled through the ship. Most of the normal populace has gone into hiding due to the alerts and system warnings. This was good since the group didn't wish to be seen by the general public in the first place either.

A few moments later, they entered the training area where around 1000 or so Pure members were currently present. Not only that, but the high-ranking members from Rank 11 to 20 that were still alive were also standing at the front.

"We had prepared for this." The Rank 11 of the agents declared as he stepped forward. He was a tall figure that looked thin. His face was sunken in, making his head look like that of a human skull. "There was always the possibility that you would come to attack under the disguise of apologizing. We have been preparing for an attack on the Green family. Do you really think that we wouldn't be ready for—"

A large fist punched agent 11 right in the face and sent him flying through the air before he could even finish his words. Then landing on the ground and standing in front of everyone was Peter.

"Why does everyone one of you have to talk so much? We're in a rush, you bast*ds!"

The large-scale attack started once again, but with the skilled agents that knew Qi, it looked like this was going to be difficult. Or so they thought, as in the middle of their fight, coming out like a lightning bolt and Logan and Sil appeared in front of everyone.

Lightning covered both of Sil's hands and was already shocking the nearby enemy Pure members.

"This is the last place, and then we can go to Quinn," Sil stated.

Although many of those there thought they could win due to their numbers, Agent 18 felt otherwise. Seeing Agent 11 and others being defeated so easily, they needed help.

'Why…why can't I get in contact with Zero? Why hasn't he responded yet when the main base is in a crisis?' Agent 18 wondered.

# Chapter ﻿1875 True power of the Shadow

Chris was shrouded in complete darkness. It was something he had never experienced before. He couldn't see anything around himself nor hear or smell anything to judge where he was.

It was strange that all the noises one would usually hear normally seemed to have disappeared, even the sound of his own heartbeat. It was truly a frightening experience, making him wonder if he was even alive.

'Is this a skill…or have I been sent to the afterlife?'

He tried to use his Qi or do the routine stuff he normally did, but there was still no such reaction at all. Finally, however, he soon was able to feel something, intense pain in his stomach.

Looking down for a few seconds, he noticed a red fist.

'This is real…he really has managed to get rid of my sense somehow, but it looks like when he hits me, it breaks the strange shadow he has.'

Chris honestly didn't know if he was flying through the air or what because he couldn't even feel the wind, all he knew was Quinn's hand was on his stomach the last time he had seen it.

In desperation, Chris threw his fist as fast as possible, trying to claw at Quinn.

'Did I hit him, or did I hit the air?'

In the middle of his thoughts, another strong punch came right from behind, it was powerful, and for a moment, Chris heard his bones crack when the shadow broke for a split second.

Another punch hit Chris across the face, and now he felt pain all over his body.

'This damned shadow, it covers me as soon as he attacks me. I can't tell where he is.'

The only thing Chris had on his side was that even though the hits on his body were hard, he could heal from these wounds.

'I have no choice. All I can do is make a swing and try to hit him. I will use all my attacks, maybe one of them will hit him, and I will escape from this wretched prison!'

However, despite this, the beating on Chris continued as he suffered from Quinn's punches and kicks.

——

From the outside, Quinn was hitting non-stop. A knee to the stomach, a pull from the shoulder and a punch to the face— Each hit had the Qi and red aura powers as he continued to give Chris a beating.

'I was hesitant at first, but this worked the same way as it did against Sil.' Quin thought. 'Chris is strong, Chris is really strong, but fighting completely blind is impossible at our level.

For a second, Quinn had stopped the beating, the land looked different, from the constant attacks of hitting Chris on the ground, punching him, throwing him, and slamming him all over the place, but no matter what, Chris still stood up time after time.

Coming to a halt, he looked at Chris. The latter's body was still covered in the shadow, and he was huffing and panting, trying to catch his breath as the wounds on his body began to heal.

'This power…is strong, and it's what I need to keep going.'

Since nothing was working so far, Quinn needed to use all his power to take Chris down, just like with Graham, when the latter's body would heal itself time after time. Quinn needed to prepare a strong attack once again.

'I don't have the same amount of blood to use as last time, so I will just have to do what I can with my own blood aura and celestial energy.'

In the next instant, Quinn spread out both his hands and four great large swords, each about the size of a car, formed behind his back. They were covered in a dark red aura of power and pointed at Chris. At the same time, Quinn opened his hand in a claw-like shape as he got into a stance.

He drifted his hand in the air, and the red flow of energy followed. Crossing his hands, Quinn made deep cuts on his arms, draining more of his blood out of his body. The Celestial blood energy was flowing out of his body. It floated and gathered around his fingertips, making them sharper and condensed.

However, the flow of blood continued to spiral around, floating about and began to glow brighter by the second.

'Using celestial energy in my fights hasn't been favourable, but I think I have found a way to use the power to give me as much power as possible.'

——

'The attacks have stopped.' Chris noticed, 'But I know this isn't a good sign. My body is strong. I know that, so he must be trying to charge up to finish me off.

'I carried on with this fight because I wanted to push Quinn to the limit. To see how strong he is. I need to know his strength, if we will go up against Zero. I know I haven't fought against Zero or seen him fight at full strength for a while.

'But I also know that he isn't the type of person to just do nothing during this whole time. He must have gotten considerably stronger.'

With all these thoughts in his head, Chris had made the decision.

"Quinn! I don't want to fight you! I've lost this fight already. I wasn't trying to hurt your friends. Instead, I told them I would join up with them to take down Zero!"

With the shadow over his body, Chris couldn't even hear his own voice, but he was sure Quinn at least heard his words.

'What is this?' Quinn frowned. 'Desperation? I know Chris isn't a bad person, but he has always been by Zero's side, and for him to have lived this long, he must have used the Qi drain skill.

'The Chris in front of me is not the same person who had taught me once before.'

Moving from his back, all four of the giant blood swords went towards Chris, with the spiralled floating celestial blood from Quinn's own body flowing through the air, and a large trail of blood aura came out from behind him as he charged forward as fast as he could.

[A new skill has been created]

[Celestial Tiger Blood Pulse]

At this moment, the system had created a new skill. It was strange because this had never happened even though it had been a long time since a blood attack had been created, and Quinn had used the blood control and changed his attack multiple times,

So it made him wonder, why now of all times? And that's when he felt something strange happening as well. As the skill was being used, the gauntlet, and Quinn's fist, let out a pulse of red aura that ran through his entire body and behind him.

It didn't just happen once but went on continuously, and it looked like the pulse of red aura that was coming out was larger than ever.

'This will finish it!'

"Quinn!" Chris shouted. "Believe me, if not me, then believe in Leo!"

The latest_epi_sodes are on_the ʟɪʙʀᴇᴀᴅ.ᴄᴏᴍ. website.

Quinn's fist was aimed right towards Chris' chest, right where his heart would be, and all of the swords floating in the air were ready to stab Chris from every angle. However, hearing Leo's name, Quinn used all the power that he had left and shifted his foot slightly.

Moving his clawed hand, he hit the ground right next to Chris, and an enormous explosion erupted. The island was split in half, and part of it was growing into the sea. Large waves formed behind the attack, and the shadow on Chris started to rescind.

Quinn was trying to catch some breath while looking at what he had caused. In front of him, there was nothing but the sea, and they were only on half the island now. Next to him, Chris had cancelled his werewolf form, but the blood swords had managed to go through his body. Entering from his back and the top of his shoulders.

The next moment, Chris fell to the ground as he collapsed.

[Quest complete]

[Defeat a god slayer]

# Chapter ﻿1876 Universal Gift

Looking at the collapsed Chris on the floor, the large blood swords that had entered his body had disappeared. It was clear he was no longer in any state left to fight, so Quinn decided to retract the rest of his skills himself as well and allowed his body to heal the wounds on his hand.

'That attack at the end, the new one. I managed to expend the Celestial energy properly…similar to when I thought against Graham that time. Maybe, this is a step to using it better.' Quinn thought.

Although Chris was bleeding quite badly, even now, his body was healing, but his breaths were deep. Looking around Quinn went to pick up his demon tier chest piece and placed it in his shadow. He then looked at the broken parts of the Blue fang set.

Not just one part had been destroyed, but all of it. Still, he placed this in his shadow as well, as a memento.

'That was some attack power Chris had in his attacks to destroy Demon tier equipment like that. It makes me wonder, If I had to take a few of his attacks straight on, what would have happened? These Werewolves are strong.

'In a way, they really are physically superior to vampires. I kind of understand a bit of what was said and how the vampires acted in the past. Getting rid of everything they deemed as a threat.'

[5,420 Mc points have been removed from your total amount.]

Seeing the system messege, it was expected. The new skill that Quinn had used with the shadow, it was a skill that could only be used with his soul weapon Shadow Overload. However, Quinn knew that blocking attacks would take up a large amount of MC cells.

So against a strong opponent like Chris, he refused to use it in such a way. Otherwise, the drawback for using his soul weapon in blocking attacks would have been too great. He would have been back to 0 once again.

Using it in the way he had done, with portals and such, and covering his opponent's entire body in shadow, had a set amount of MC cells that would be taken for using such a skill. Although it still didn't allow him to use it as freely and against whoever he wanted, it was a much more viable option.

'The best thing to do, is still to search for Nest Crystals so I don't have to worry. If I had over a million MC points, maybe then I could even use it to block attacks from the greats and god slayers as well.'

There was a reason why Quinn was thinking about this, and it was due to completing the quest of defeating a god slayer. Although he hadn't killed Chris and could see he was still bleeding, defeat must have meant winning the battle.

[You have defeated a God Slayer]

[The Universe has decided to reward you.]

[Please choose from one of the following.]

[Celestial Level increase]

[Celestial Energy increase]

[MC points increase]

The three options had made him somewhat struggle with what to choose. The main reason was that the rewards didn't state how much the increase would be.

The celestial level up would help Quinn in the celestial space and give him a new skill to use. However, the Celestial skills tended to be more helpful to his dedicated followers and less so to him.

At the same time, he could no longer really enter the Celestial space and was already back on Earth, where he needed to be anyway. If Bliss pulled the same trick again, he would have problems, but he felt like it was unlikely.

On top of that, with celestial energy being increased, meant that he might go up a level anyway, which was the natural way to do things. The only thing was, although Celestial energy was great for fighting against Celestials until recently, it did next to nothing fighting against non-celestials.

Who knew how long it would take before Quinn learnt to use Celestial energy in a way it would be able to help him in fights against others as well?

'I'm really going to kick myself in the foot if it's a small increase, but after seeing how effective the Shadow can be and how it's been used. The MC point increase would be the best.'

Selecting his reward, Quinn could feel strange energy enter his body, it felt as if something was being drawn out for the air, and was going inside him. Energy that no one could see, something he had never seen before, but this feeling was familiar.

It was the same feeling Quinn had when he would absorb the nest Crystals as well. This continued on for a while, and while in the middle of this, there were a few guests that had suddenly appeared on the island.

"So this is where all the fun was," Sil stated.

After heading to the military section of the Pure Ship, with Sil there, they had made quick work of all of them and had managed to get information from the lab this time before destroying it.

After that, Sil suggested that it was best for them to make a quick exit as soon as they could. So he decided to teleport them to where he had felt the energy from before. It was easy work, Green city was further, so even with more people, it was no hassle.

Everyone looked at Quinn, and it seemed like he was in the middle of doing something and was on his own on the island.

"The fighting stopped. Does that mean?" Mitchell didn't say the next sentence because everyone was worried.

"He's over here!" Peter shouted out.

Everyone ran over to where Chris was and could see he was badly hurt. The reason why his body was finding it hard to heal was actually due to the celestial energy that flowed into him. Quinn didn't notice it, but during his tiger pulse attack, the celestial pulse had gone off, and the energy had entered into the open wounds the Blood swords had created.

Chris's body was doing well to fight it off, though, it was just taking longer than usual to heal.

"Did Quinn do all of this..I'm guessing he wasn't able to speak to him in time then." Jessica commented.

"It appears not, but we should see this as a good thing," Muka stated. "His luck is great because he has survived, and Quinn for whatever reason has chosen to spare him. So at the end of the day, no harm has been done."

There was a weird smile on Muka's face. While looking at Chris in a pool of blood, it was hard to be positive. There was looking at the glass half full, and then there was this.

"Don't worry. I can do something." Sil replied as he got his book out, changing his set of abilities once again, and pressed both hands on Chris's body.

Soon, they all saw the wounds closing up at an incredible speed, the colour on Chris's skin was returning as well, and he was starting to look a lot better.

"A healing ability?" Lucia commented. "How many abilities can you hold? What Blade are you?"

A lot of what she had blurted out was meant to be said in her head, but she was so surprised that she just had to say something in the end.

"I don't mind explaining a bit, but I have lived for as long as Quinn. So I have a few tricks up my sleeve and that book of mine, allows me to change to use whatever ability I have used before."

Hearing this, the others around were stunned. The Balde were already strong, and their ability disregarded them for a lot of rules that they already knew, and now this. The person in front of them was clearly a monster, on the scale of Quinn.

Ceril, who kept quiet, knew there was more to it as well because Sil hadn't even used the demon-tier weapons that he had in his possession that he had done on the last planet.

Eventually, Chris opened his eyes once again and started to lift his body.

"You are all here, and I'm still…"

"Yes, you're still alive," Peter replied. "But honestly, with Quinn back, I'm not sure we really needed you or not."

Before, Chris would have thought that Peter was exaggerating Quinn's strength. Now, having faced it face to face, he no longer did he think this. Maybe, Quinn could solve this all on his own again, like he had done in the past, without Pure, without him.

The latest_epi_sodes are on_the ʟɪʙʀᴇᴀᴅ.ᴄᴏᴍ. website.

Chris clenched his fist.

'It's fine even if that is the case…this time, I will be on the right side.'

It was at that moment, that Quinn had finished with what he was doing, and he looked at both of his hands.

'What is this…what was all of that? How is this even possible?'

[620,234 Total MC points]

*****

# Chapter ﻿1877 A vampire and a werewolf

Quinn continued to look at his stat points. He was wondering if he had miscounted, but without a doubt the number that was on the screen was true. From this quest alone, he had earned around 500,000 MC points.

'How was I even able to get such a reward from the system in the first place?' Quinn started to think. 'Is the system still rewarding me through equivalent exchange? Has the system continued to grow like Vincent thought? Or was it something else?'

Thinking about it more, Quinn did see that this time the system stated that the Universe was the one that wanted to reward him for his tasks, which made him wonder, was the Universe trying to push him in a general direction?

For him, a Celestial to go against his natural enemy, the Godslayers, it was hard to say and due to not knowing any other Celestials that he could just speak to, he was also unable to find out if they received such things for defeating Godslayers.

Either way, he had been given what he had been given and it was more than he had ever expected. For a long time, Quinn thought about his strength. It had been at its greatest when he had originally turned into the Celestial he is today.

There was a surge of power from the transformation, his celestial energy could be used freely and, on top of that, Quinn had gathered the blood of those from all over to defeat his enemy. However, he felt like this entire time he had never been able to get to that same place again.

He tried to make up for his loss of strength by learning new skills and becoming creative in the way he used celestial energy and more. With all of that, Quinn had grown stronger, but still not comparable to that time.

Now though, with his new skills improving his shadow as well as with the additional 500,000 MC points, Quinn believed that he could do more, and without a doubt, he was currently at the strongest he had ever been.

Quinn looked at his fist and clenched it hard with a smile on his face. It was hard not to smile at this achievement, especially with how many bad turns there had been lately in his life.

'If only I could go to the Celestial space with all my powers now. I would love to show the arrogant gods what's up.'

It was only then, after hearing the sound of the voices next to him, that Quinn had noticed that the others had arrived. He had seen them while he was absorbing energy but had not really paid attention to them.

Quickly he rushed over and could see that they were all crowded around Chris.

"Judging from the fact that everyone is around you and isn't scared, I have to believe what you said is true." Quinn stated.

"Is that your way of apologizing?" Chris asked, standing up off the floor. His outside wounds had healed but there was clearly some damage inside him as well.

"I'm sorry." Quinn replied. "Things have been difficult for me as well. Since I've come back I've lost a lot of people, and you can't blame me due to the last time we met as well."

Soon sniffling sounds interrupted the group. Turning around they could all see that Minny had burst into tears.

"Da-da-daddy!" Minny screamed and leapt up from where she was and grabbed Quinn right by the neck.

For a second, Quinn couldn't breathe, as he slowly held her in his arms and close to his chest.

"Where did you go? Why did it take you so long to get back!" Minny started to cry.

"I'm sorry." Quinn said as he wiped away Minny's tears. A lot of them were wondering the same thing, but didn't want to ruin this father and daughter moment. "I tried to come back as quickly as possible, but it's my fault that you were left on your own."

"I wasn't strong enough to stay by your side, but I won't let that happen again." Quinn smiled.

The sniffles and the tears slowed down as Minny grabbed Quinn by the face and started to rub her large fat cheek against his. The females' hearts melted as they saw this affection.

Quinn was already an incredibly handsome man and seeing him act this way with Minny was just melting the women's hearts.

"Quinn, you are a good dad… maybe you need a wife as well." Muka said confidently without any embarrassment in her voice.

Jessica wished that she could have been as brave as Muka, but when looking at the two of them, she just felt like it was impossible to compete.

'He still doesn't know about Layla yet either.' Jessica thought, as the list of women who were interested in Quinn just kept piling up.

"Quinn, the two of us have a lot to talk about, and I'm sure there is a lot that the others want to share with you as well." Chris stated. "But since they are all here, there is one more thing I need to do before I leave."

Moving away from the others, it looked like Chris was ready to jump in the direction of the ship, but before he did, Sil had approached him.

"You're planning to go back right? Don't worry, I'll pop you over there, turn invisible, let you do your thing and we can come back." Sil said.

With all of his abilities, there seemed to be nothing that the group couldn't do. Once changing out his abilities, Sil did just that, teleporting Chris right on the deck of the ship towards the front. In an instant, he turned invisible.

There were a lot of people on the deck, panicking, worried, scared and wondering if they should try and leave, but they could suddenly see Chris in front of them and no one else.

"Agent 1, you have to help us, the Ship, it's under attack!" One man cried.

Soon, many followed after him, pleading for Chris to help out those in Pure. They had assumed seeing him now, that he wasn't present and that was how the ship had come to be in its current state.

"Enough! Chris shouted out to them all with a powerful Qi voice. They could feel the vibrations in their body, causing them all to shut up.

"I am not here to help you." Chris said. "In fact, I am here to tell you the truth. I was the one that started the attack on the ship. I was the one that caused all of this mess. I know many of you may be upset or annoyed with me, but I will explain myself.

"Pure is not the group you think it is. The leader Zero is using everyone, using even the members and soldiers of Pure for his own goal. He has been doing this from the very beginning and Pure has lost its goal ever since the loss of Lucy, the original founder.

"Zero has been using humans for experimentation. Trying to combine them with beasts. He has used slaves to make his life longer. The man that you look up to, the organization that you have been supporting has been doing nothing but use you.

"I understand that many of you don't believe me, and perhaps will never believe me, but I have not done any of this because I want you to thank me, or to like me, you may all even hate me for ruining your life no matter what the reason.

"I have done this because I have done what I believe is right. I couldn't stand by and do nothing anymore."

After Chris had said his words, there was quiet for a few moments until the crowd started once again.

"Traitor! You attacked our home!"

"You've gone to the Green's side, you're just doing this to support them, you have ruined everything for us!"

There were many words, many insults, and many tears as well. Turning his back towards them, it was the signal that Chris was ready to go.

'I don't mind being the villain of the people, if that's what they need.' Chris thought.

The next second he was teleported and back on the island with everyone else.

"Those people will one day understand what you did for them." Sil said as he made himself reappear. Chris was stronger than him in some ways, because if he was in Chris's position he would just be filled with anger. The people he was doing everything for and trying to help had treated him like that!

"Alright, you can take us back to Green City, right?" Quinn asked Sil.

"Of course, who do you think I am?" Sil said as he told everyone to gather.

"A Werewolf, A Vampire, A Superhuman, and the strongest undead you will ever see." Peter commented. "I don't think we will have any problem taking out Zero."

The portal opened up, and it was time for them to head back to Green City, as everyone had a lot to talk about.

****

# Chapter 1878 The World has Changed

Sil had been to Green City a few times before, so as long as their location hadn't changed, he was able to get them all back safe and sound to Green City. If it had changed, then there was a good chance that they would be falling in the sea, but rather than ask, Sil had decided to just grab them and teleport them all anyway.

Slowly, after using his powers, he began to open his eyes, and could see they were in the lab that he was familiar with. At the top of Green tower.

"Great, it looks like we made it safe, that's a relief." Sil said with a smile.

"Relief, what do you mean by that? Were you not sure?" Quinn asked, somewhat guessing what could've happened to them all if Sil hadn't used his powers correctly.

"We are here right, so all is okay, come on. We have a lot to catch up on." Sil stated.

In the lab there was a lot of open space but there weren't many seats, since in the first place it was a lab made for Logan to work on his experiments and such. Placing both his hands on the floor and activating his soul weapon, he could control and make anything into a form of technology or AI, so he started to break down the structure of the place and turn it into large seats for everyone to sit down in.

Once everyone was seated, Logan sat back in his chair, and let out a big sigh.

"I have to say, none of what has occurred was within my calculations." Logan said looking at Chris who was even in the room with them. "I guess, so that we are all up to date, we should start off with informing Quinn what has occurred from the beginning since he had left, and then maybe we can figure this whole thing out."

The others agreed, and Quinn was also interested to know what they had been doing. It was easier for Logan to do the talking and explaining, because he had filmed a lot of the events after Quinn had left.

The first thing that had taken place, of course, was the tournament that had occurred. During that, Vincent had revealed himself stating that he was looking for Quinn. However, the tournament had been stopped as Laxmus had joined in at the last second, eventually taking out Vincent and taking the Red heart which Vincent had instilled in his body.

"Wait, Vincent is still alive, and he had the red heart!" Quinn said, surprised. Another person, who had helped him through a lot was here.

"Vincent is still alive, we are using a Nest crystal to get his vitals back up to what they were before. Don't worry, I will let you see him." Logan said.

Continuing on the tale, Logan went on to inform them of the next part, and that was heading to the Red Vampires' base. While there, they were already fighting with the dhampirs. Laxmus had been defeated, but the Red Heart had been taken by Erin.

From listening to everything, and the details the other went into when describing how strong she was, Quinn was trying to think how he would deal with her. Laxmus certainly was powerful and had the help of his celestial, by quite a bit by the sounds of it.

He was also happy to hear that Borden was alive as well, and when they had no problems, he would like to go back to the Blade family, possibly with Sil, to say hello to them.

In the end, Quinn had decided that he was currently stronger then Erin. He just couldn't imagine the current him not being able to deal with her. However, his mind was quite distracted by one thing.

'Layla... so she really was working on our side this whole time, and she is still alive and in charge of the Red Vampires. That is a relief. I would love to go see her... but what would I even say?' Quinn thought.

Then it was time for them to explain why they had gone to the Pure base, Rein, in the first place. Trying to find out why Erin had turned into what she was currently. They explained their theory of thinking it was linked with Leo, and that was why they had gone to Chris.

That's when they were in for a surprise, and learnt about Leo's dreadful past. While listening to it all, Quinn was clenching his fist. While telling him the story, the others felt a pressure coming off him, that made them feel heavy, that even he wasn't aware he was giving.

Quinn sat there in silence for a good five minutes with no one saying a word due to how heavy the atmosphere was. Until...

"Daddy, please don't be angry!" Minny shouted as she ran over and jumped up sitting in his lap. "I don't like it when dad is upset. We just got back, and we are together now, and now you're all upset!"

For some reason, seeing Minny act this way, it had calmed him down a bit, and he gave her a big smile and hug.

"You also went through a lot as well. I'm sorry that you got hurt and your powers taken away... don't worry. I promise I will pay her back." Quinn stated.

Minny didn't see it because Quinn had said these words while hugging her, but the others could see for a second, a flash of red glow was seen in his eyes. He was beyond furious whenever a certain person's name was mentioned, he was just hiding it extremely well.

Now with Minny sitting in his lap, he was stroking her which she seemed to enjoy and he continued while talking since it was calming for the both of them.

"From everything that has been explained so far, from the sounds of it, if I was to take a guess, Zero is also working for a god." Quinn explained.

There were many confused faces and looks in the room, but Quinn went on with his theory for a while.

"I can't think of anyone else that would be able to bring back those that he killed back on this earth. Perhaps a god has promised him that he will bring them back if he does something for them. This is the only thing that makes sense in my head.

"I know a lot of you won't understand what I'm talking about, but maybe it's time I tell you everything I have been through."

Quinn went on to detail what had occurred to him while he was away, and to all of them it sounded like a mystical tale. Planets, other races, gods, a celestial space, and more. It was hard for them to imagine there were such things, that their current lives and the things they were going through were so small in the grand scale of the universe.

What was even more impressive were the strange actions that Quinn had decided to take to come back. Even when telling his story, they could tell how urgent and serious he sounded in wanting to come back.

However, despite all the things about the gods, and such of the world, the one thing that stuck out to them the most out of everything, was that there was a Dalki. This was something that they could comprehend and could imagine the dangers that they would face.

Since it was so far away, and in the distance, Quinn had told them not to worry about it, at least for now. Instead he wanted to focus on the current problems that Earth had before any of that.

"Erin... honestly, I'm not sure what to do. From the story you told I think she too is dangerous. I understand you guys trying to find out the truth, and finding out why she is doing this, but I already lost someone close to me because of that. Leo lost his life because he was too obsessed with finding out why this had happened to her.

"If I was to meet her again, I would say the best thing to do is to put an end to her. Before she does anything else."

The answer from Quinn had surprised many in the room. Although they had only been traveling Quinn for a short while, they knew no matter what he would avoid killing unless he had to, and now he was willing to kill his friend just like that.

It made them think, what Quinn had expressed, learning about the Celestials and that entire space to act like this, caused him to see the world in a different way.

"What about Layla." Peter asked. "I know you might be able to accept the fact that we have to eliminate Erin, but Layla won't, and are you going to be the one that tells her you killed her best friend without finding out why?"

Peter was right, and the silence from Quinn made him think. He was still sure it was the right thing to do, but his emotional attachment to Layla made him second guess things for sure.

"I know!" Sil clicked his fingers. "Hey Logan, what location is the Red Vampire base at again."

Saying a bunch of numbers that only Sil would understand, Sil nodded, and opened up a portal, disappearing. Then a minute later it had opened up again and being pushed out the portal along with Sil was none other than Layla.

"Why don't you talk to her yourself."

# Chapter 1879 MY MAN!!!

Inside the castle-like structure, Layla was staring out the window looking at all of the vampires down below. The people had smiles on their faces and the streets were lit up. There was a good atmosphere all around.

The Red Vampire base had been rebuilt back to what it once was. There was the option of moving again, but Layla felt like there was now a history to the place for the people here. This gave the whole area more value. To them it felt more like a home and they had gone through the rebuilding of their home.

'I made the right decision in staying here.' Layla thought.

"You have done extremely well." Xander stated in the corner of the room with a bow. During the entire time, he had stayed by her side helping her fix and rebuild everything.

On top of that, he was happy because he had never seen Layla happier in these 1000 years. It was almost as if becoming the leader of the Red Vampires had given her a purpose that she was missing.

'Finally, she can forget about Quinn and continue to live her life. I'm sorry to say this. I know Quinn, you did a lot for her, and I know from the stories that Layla has said about the two of you that you cared for her, but with you gone again, it could be another 1000 years until you see each other again.

'I don't want her to hold on for that long, not again.'

Lifting his head, to look at Layla, he suddenly saw that a portal had appeared behind her. Immediately, Xander wasted no time rushing across the room, blood aura surrounded his fist as he went out to throw a punch.

It slammed into something solid and the strength behind the punch shook the room. However, whatever, or whoever had come out of the portal, was currently holding onto his fist.

"You shouldn't attack guests like this." Sil replied.

"Guests? You're an intruder!" When Xander said these words, he was trying to figure out who was in front of him. Judging from the smell, it seemed like a human but how would any human be able to hold his fist solidly like this.

Layla turned around and could only see the back of his head. Unlike Xander, she didn't react straight away but had her hand on her black sword that she kept at her side at all times.

"Everyone, it would be best if you were to calm down," the mysterious man stated. "I am just here because I want to take you to Quinn."

Those words had frozen both of them and before they knew it, Sil had grabbed Layla by the hand who was frozen and opened up another portal, taking her away.

Meanwhile, Xander was left stunned in place, Layla and the mysterious man no longer could be seen in front of him.

"Did he say… Quinn? Is Quinn back… I hope this outcome will be a good one for her." Xander stated as he smiled and decided to wait in the room for her return.

——

The portal opened up back in the lab where Logan and the others were, and stumbling through at first was Layla, and following her was none other than Sil.

"Alright, so it looks like everyone is here. It looks like we can talk now about what to do." Sil smiled.

At first Layla's eyes had landed on Logan, he was still as small as she remembered him, but it had been a long time since the two of them had last met. Her heart ached a little, thinking of all the time she had spent on the other side of the whole thing.

After that, she moved her head, with her eyes falling on the rest of the group. She had seen all of them during the attack before. Then finally, they laid on one person… Quinn.

Immediately, she knew that this was him, his long black hair, his perfectly symmetrical face and his pointed, but strong, chin. There was no emotion on her face. The others were looking closely to see what her face would show but it looked calm and collected.

However, there was something on her body that was reacting and it was her horns. Constantly they were turning a bright red and cooling down. It was like a heartbeat only it was going incredibly fast as the horns continued to blink and blink.

Other than this, the two of them just stayed there staring at each other for a while. Not a single one of them saying a word.

"That's the one Daddy likes!" Minny shouted and pointed. She had been following their story for a while.

Immediately, Jessica picked Minny up and covered her mouth. More so than ever, this scene was hurting her quite a bit.

'I've lost… I already know I've lost. Never have I ever seen that guy make that type of reaction, or look at a person in that way before.' Jessica thought. 'At least I can move on now. I should just think of Quinn as an unreachable Hero, like a superstar in a movie.'

"Alright everyone!" Peter shouted, clapping his hands. "Let's give these guys some space. It's clear that we are giving them a bit of stage fright. We'll come back and talk about this once you guys are done, just give us the signal."

Peter said walking off and everyone else went to walk off toward the other side of the lab as well, out of respect for the two of them. That's when they saw that Logan was doing something strange.

He had gone to one of his computer terminals and placed his hand on it. Then a couple of seconds later a screen appeared. On the screen itself, there was none other than Quinn and Layla.

"I have cameras all over my lab that I can access. They are in my lab so I see nothing wrong with doing this."

The others didn't say anything because they too were interested in what was going to happen. So instead they crowded around the monitor with their backs toward Quinn and Layla.

"Quinn…" Layla said being the first one to speak. "It's been so long… so very long." Layla thought she could hold it back, but already now that the others were away, there were droplets of tears running down her cheeks, and a lump was felt in her throat.

"I… I was so worried, so worried that I would never be able to see you again. There were days where I thought I forgot what you looked like. You… you of all people in the world, the person I thought I would never forget.

"I felt so guilty that I was forgetting your face, and I'm not talking about the ones that they plastered on the statue, I'm talking about the real face that's in front of me now." She sniffled and wiped away her tears.

"Lay-"

"Let me finish." Layla said with her head to the ground. "I waited for you Quinn… I waited and waited, waited for the day for you to come back, and then I heard you returned but you disappeared again.

"I had hope and it was chucked away. My heart was ripped out again. It was so painful for me, so painful that I decided to bury you inside of myself, bury you… and try to forget about you."

Finally, Layla lifted her head, her eyes swollen from crying, tears still falling all down her face and her cheeks a little rounder than before.

"I… realized I couldn't though, Quinn. I could never forget about you because I love you."

With no sound made after that, no footstep touching on the floor, Quinn was suddenly right in front of Layla. He had moved so fast and quickly she had no time to notice. Before she could do anything, he had hugged her pulling her tightly into his chest.

"Layla." Quinn said his voice was a little lumpy and shaky. "No matter what happened to me, you were always there for me. You were there at the beginning when I turned into this. You stayed with me even though I was different and you never hated me for getting you involved in all of this mess.

"Instead, you stayed by my side each time, and continued to try and help me in your own way. I heard from the others about everything that has happened, and I realize now. At any second, anything from our lives can be taken away.

"So I'm not going to hide how I feel, I'm not going to just wait for something to happen. I have to do things myself like I always have done and that includes my feelings for you. Last time I was unable to do this, but this time I will."

Quinn's fingers touched the side of her neck gently. Layla felt a force pull her forward and a tingling sensation could be felt running up her entire neck. The two's faces angled with Layla's staring into Quinn's. The next moment moving forward, Quinn's lips had locked with Layla's.

Two of them kissed each other, closing their eyes, longing for this long awaited moment.

"YEAHHHHH MY MAN!" Peter shouted as he started to clap.

All the others that were watching the video also began to cheer, on the sideline soon after Peter, at this joyous moment.
