# Chapter 1580 - Finding Everyone

One thousand sixteen years. This number kept repeating in Quinn's head. For one, he hadn't even been alive for that long in the first place, and yet suddenly, so many years had gone by. Initially, Quinn was worried about ten years going past. What had happened to all the threats that still remained, but a thousand years...it just all seemed so unreal.

Looking at Peter as well, he wanted to make a comment; he didn't understand how one couldn't have a sense of time of what went on. How come the apartment they were put in never changed during that time? It wasn't altered or anything, nor did anyone step in.

Things were seriously head-scratching for Quinn, but the one that he was worried about was all the others.

'My friends...everyone who fought by my side, what about them, are they still alive?' Quinn thought.

Thinking about it, most of them were turned into subclasses for vampires—Sam, Layla Dennis and so on. However, even as vampires, their time wasn't unlimited unless they were original, but there was a bit of hope. After all, there were vampires like Bryce who were still strong and managed to live a long life.

When thinking about vampires and from what he knew, a lot of it seemed to be connected to will. If one had the will to live on, their body would continue and follow that will. Bryce had an unyielding will to keep on fighting.

'But would they have a reason to stay like Bryce? What if everything was resolved? They probably thought that I would never wake up, or I wasn't even there when they came to visit me, not knowing where I went. Would they still be alive?'

On top of that, there were also Quinn's friends who weren't vampires. Sil and Logan were both Human. At best, Human's had a lifespan of around one hundred twenty years but thousand? Unless there had been some advancement he didn't know about, it was unlikely.

Vordan and Raten were beasts, and strong ones who could live for thousands of years; however, they were simply borrowing the beasts' bodies, and then there was Owen, one of the big four who survived and fought the Dalki with all his strength.

Quinn was apparently on one of the Greylash families' planets. Quinn would have loved to have said something to him.

"And that will be the test for you all." The examiner said.

It seemed while Quinn was stuck in his thoughts, the examiner had explained all the rules and what needed to be done. Looking at Peter, it looked like he was also in a daze. Peter still had a family that was alive at that time, parents who cared about him. Yet, he chose to sacrifice his time with them to look after Quinn.

"Peter... I just wanted to say you're a really good friend." Quinn smiled.

"Are you just saying that because now I'm your only friend? Quinn, a thousand freaking years!" Peter replied.

The two of them then looked at Minny, who didn't seem to have understood the current predicament. Quinn had said they would look for her mother, but with how much time had passed, there wasn't much chance of that happening unless someone had turned her mother into a vampire.

'It's my fault, I brought Minny along with me…I'll look after her..but does that mean I'll have to adopt her? Will I become her father?' Quinn thought.

Suddenly, a loud crash bellowed through the room, which had distracted Quinn out of his thoughts. Right now, all of the participants were to stay behind the statue as they watched one of the groups take part in the exam. The participants were using abilities, weapons, and more as they took on what looked like humanoid robots.

The robots were as large as a human with a male figure. It reminded Quinn of the small mechs during his time, only these were much faster and agile, and it looked like they packed quite the punch. They also were able to produce energy blasts from the palm of their hand.

At the same time, he noticed a beast crystal powering it in the centre of its chest.

'Although the technology in the cities hasn't improved that much, I guess they did improve some things in the last thousand years...'

Thinking about it, his system was coming back online slowly. Even now, it was already at 6 percent. Perhaps by the end of the day, he would get his body back, but there was something else he had unlocked that he wished to use.

[Inspect]

[A.I. Battle robot]

[Current grade crystal: Intermediate]

'I see, so the grade of the crystal determines the strength of these robots' power. It reminds me a bit of the gargoyle that I used to create. So they want contestants to be at least able to beat intermediate beasts, huh? That's a higher cutoff compared to the past.'

Just then, though, Quinn spotted something else at the bottom, and this was exactly what he was hoping to see.

[Creator: Logan Green]

A large grin appeared on Quinn's face when seeing this. When using the inspect skill, certain items' info would tell about who created them. The thing was, it didn't just say a random name and then Green at the end, the word on the robot specifically stated that it was Logan Green. Either Logan was still alive and well somehow, making inventions, or he had created tech while he was alive that was still in use to this day.

'I'm glad...I was able to see your name in some way. If the Green family still exists, it's worth paying them a visit. They might know more about what happened compared to anyone else.' Quinn thought.

The test eventually ended, and another group was called. Seeing Jessica walking out, it looked like it was their cue to take part. Of course, having already attracted much attention, many participants waited for their performance.

'There's no need to worry. I can take out intermediate beasts with ease even at 6 percent.' Quinn thought.

The test began when they arrived at the stage. And from the doors that were lined along the wall, five A.I. robots came out. Once again, Quinn noticed that they were all at the intermediate level.

"Just stay by my side, okay, Minny? Peter and I can protect you."

Surprisingly, the first one to charge ahead was Lucia. She had broken off from the group, perhaps to prove herself in this fight. In the next moment, she grabbed the beast spear in her hand and went to thrust it forward.

The robot was quite the distance away, but it didn't matter. Her Spear started to light up with blue lightning, and the next second, a zap came out from the end of it, hitting the robot. Its body started to shake, which allowed her to go forward and thrust her speed quickly—hitting its arms, head and vital parts.

The first robot was down. Looking around, Quinn wanted to see how Jessica was fairing. It was then that Quinn saw something familiar to him. She ran fast and straight past the robot; in doing so, the light in the room reflected a piece of red thread against the light around her.

An A.I. Robot's head rolled on the floor the next moment.

'The thirteenth family's ability? But she said she belonged to the Vampire corps, not the thirteenth family? Why does she have that power?' Quinn thought.

The two of them turned around and saw the last three robots heading for Quinn and the others. However, seeing this, Quinn didn't move because he didn't have to. Peter leapt up in the air and punched one of them in the side of the head.

Immediately it was thrown off, and its body smashed into the other two, destroying all three with a single strike. The audience watching was speechless. They had never seen in person one display such power.

At the same time, the man whom Peter almost hit earlier was now tucking his head in—knowing that a single punch could have killed him.

"I see this is far too easy for you! Let's see if you can get a higher ranking!" As more doors opened and more robots started to enter the arena, the examiner said. Now there were double the amount: ten in total.

Quinn didn't care to show his abilities. He didn't need to become a Traveller. It wasn't necessary to him and brought him no benefits other than helping Jessica, so he would allow the two girls to shine and that they did.

However, while fighting, a robot had blasted a hit at Lucia, right on her forearm. The impact scratched her skin, making her bleed a little. It dripped onto the floor, and the next second, Quinn saw someone run past him.

'Minny! I forgot she's a new vampire; it's the first time she smelt blood!'

Quinn didn't know what happened at that moment, but as he wanted to reach out to Minny, he felt something. It was as if he could feel the red energy inside Minny. The energy that was doing her act like so. It was wild.

Reaching out his hand, Quinn tried to control this energy. He could feel it like it was his own, running through his body, and in the next second. Minny's steps began to slow down.

"Huh..why am I here?" Minny muttered to herself.

'What did I just do? Did I just get rid of her blood lust?' Quinn thought.

'Did you not remember what the system showed you?' Ray asked. 'You are not just a vampire; you are a celestial vampire. Quinn, you are practically a god now, close to being a god of the vampires. Doing something like this is just child's play for you.'

Thinking about it, if that was true, then what could Quinn do when his body was back at its strongest.

From this distance, Quinn lifted up the small amount of blood that was on the floor. One of the robots was coming after Minny. Although his body wasn't there, his blood control was as good as it had ever been.

The next second, Quinn threw it right towards one of the robots and pierced its chest, causing it to fall before it even reached Minny. The attack was too thin for the human eye to notice for the others.

"Did that little girl do that?"

"I think so; she must have some type of strong ability?"

Although the audience had failed to notice what had happened in that small moment, Jessica had seen it.

'Someone who can control blood like that. I've never seen that in my life. A vampire at that level. Surely it should be someone I have heard of before.' She thought.

The test was to continue, but just as the examiner would call an end having seen enough, they heard a loud bang coming from the side. Smoke entered the room, hitting everyone. It was clearly an explosion and not something done by the examiner.

It had come from the opposite side of where the participants had gathered. When the smoke settled, Quinn saw five figures standing there, male and female—wearing a dark red uniform with black lining and an array of different weapons.

"Damn it! With so many vampires gathered here; we should have known that they would come here."

"But here on the Graylash planet, why would they?" The other participants said, knowing full well who the intruders were.

While staring at them, there was one distinctive feature that Quinn could see. It was their glowing yellow eyes.

"Dhampirs! They found me..." Jessica said, her voice quivering.

*****

# Chapter 1581 - Dhampir Army

At first, Quinn thought his ears might have misheard things, but soon he heard others spouting the same word as Jessica had just seconds ago Dhampirs.

Honestly, Quinn knew very little about Dhampirs in the first place.

Only that they were a subclass that was to be killed on sight under the old rule, similar to that of a blood fairy among other ones, but also through living Vincent's life, he knew that a Dhampir was far more dangerous than a blood fairy. So much so that the other families wished to harness their power for their own strength.

'The only dhampir during my time was Erin?' Quinn thought. 'Leo attempted to control her urges until she eventually ran away…what happened? Has the vampire structure fallen that more dhampirs have been created, and since about a thousand years have passed…could all of this be Erin's doing?'

If that was the case, the one that had turned Erin into a dhampir in the first place was Quinn, and he had neglected his duty to look after her since he felt like Leo had a handle on things because. It was only later he had learned things were more complicated at that time. Yet, Quinn had his own troubles to deal with as well, but he still blamed himself.

The other participants had already started to leave the area, including the examiner himself, leaving only those currently participating in the test, which was Quinn and his group.

He could see that Jessica's confidence had faded since her body was shaking, but she had readied her string to put up quite the fight. At the same time, Lucia had equipped her spear, pointing it towards the attackers.

"You are breaking the agreement!" Lucia shouted towards them. "This is a Graylash planet. You have no right to be here!"

However, her words seemed empty, as Quinn could feel something within their bodies start to activate. It was similar to the feeling that Quinn could feel on Minny. This was a blood lust, but not for human blood.

[8 percent of the system has been synced.]

Lifting up his hand, seeing how what had worked for Minny seconds ago, Quinn thought that perhaps he could control the dhampir's blood lust. After all, they were half-vampire. He focused, but he could feel no such connection.

Unlike the red aura that Quinn could feel through Minny and Jessica, he could not connect with that of the dhampirs in front of them.

The group of dhampirs charged forward with each of them wielding a katana blade. Two of them swung their blades, and slicing through their weapons were what looked like blood swipes but yellowish in colour.

Seeing this, Jessica used her own blood swipe, but when the two collided, her attack was no match against the yellow aura as it smashed through her attack and continued forward, but before it could reach her, Lucia swung her spear down, and with it, a trail of lightning left her weapon.

Quinn could sense the Qi infused within the lightning powers. This one had different properties and effects due to the power of Qi. However, her powers weren't as strong as some members of the Graylash family he had seen before.

The Qi increased the impact of her attack. The yellow aura clashed into the lighting, and the two attacks collided in the air for a few seconds before they had eventually cancelled each other out.

However, that didn't stop the other strike that had managed to hit Lucia. She lifted up her arm to block, and the attack had pierced through her robe, making her bleed. Trying to soften the blow somewhat, she leapt up and spun her body, encasing it with lighting.

And soon fell to the floor. The wound around her arm was quite deep.

"No!" Jessica shouted as she came over. "Why did you take the hit for me?"

Jessica quickly lifted her on her shoulder and jumped back while kicking her legs out, sending more blood aura attacks in the way of the others.

"These guys need to respect our leader's wishes!" Lucia said as she tied part of the robe around her arm.

The others suddenly heard a bang from the side and wondered what was happening when they could see that one of the dhampirs had been sent flying back and crashed into the wall.

"Hey, Qu— Nate, these guys are better than I thought," Peter said, as he avoided several strikes from them and then kicked one away, hitting it a great distance and causing blood to fall from its mouth.

Soon though, the dhampir wiped its mouth and continued to charge forward.

The two girls watched in amazement as Peter was faster than them; his strength was also more powerful.

"I don't understand; who is that Wight? The dhampir forces have been too strong for vampires to deal with for so long." Jessica said. Honestly, when she saw the dhampirs arrive, she was pretty sure her life was doomed.

She had wished she had listened to her commander at the time when she had requested to leave. The latter had told her that they were better off together, but she refused to listen. Yet now, she had managed to find someone, a Wight, for the first time, that was not only able to deal with a dhampir but multiple of them at the same time.

In the meantime, Quinn was observing. Unlike him, Peter had his full strength. But he wasn't using his full speed to take them on. Peter also hadn't used his own Qi that he recently developed. Actually now that Quinn thought about it, he had developed it long ago. Still, if he did use it. the fight would have been over by now.

Perhaps, Peter knew that Quinn wanted to learn more about them. Either way, while observing them, due to them using Qi and the yellow aura that seemed to be stronger than the red aura that vampires used, he could tell that the dhampirs in front of him were at the level of the vampire knights of his time.

Although the Dhampirs were getting up several times after getting hit, they soon slowed down, helpless, as the fight continued. And the two that had gone after the girls decided to change targets to Peter.

However, one of them sensed something, and it was Minny, she was gripping on holding onto Quinn's leg, and at that moment, that dhampir had broken off from fighting against Peter and went straight towards her and Quinn.

The dhampir sliced out its blade, and a yellow slash came towards them. Minny gripped onto Quinn's leg even tighter out of fear, and for a second while fighting, Peter looked back towards Quinn and just saw him shaking his head.

"It's okay," Quinn said. "I thought maybe we could solve this misunderstanding or ask some questions….but now I see these people are scum, attacking a young girl."

[10 percent of the system has been synced.]

Picking up Minny, Quinn used the flash step at the perfect time, avoiding it and allowing it to continue hitting the wall. Quinn still wasn't as fast as Peter, but this was about skill more than anything.

After putting her down, he walked forward towards the one that charged towards them. Quickly, Quinn stepped on the dhampir's foot and knocked both of their arms up in the air. The next second, Quinn grabbed the dhampir by the head and kneed him right in the face, causing his head to fling back.

And, taking a quick step forward, he then slammed his foot on the ground and struck as hard as he could with his fist using the hammer strike right in the dhampir's stomach. The attack forced blood to pour from his mouth.

"Martial arts? A vampire that specialises in martial arts and doesn't use weapons?" Jessica thought. On top of that, they could see that Quinn was quite a skilful one.

'Hmm, I guess I still can't gather my own blood aura with 10 percent of my full strength, even though the skills and my body are still at the same level, there is still something I can do.' Quinn thought.

The dhampir wasn't dead yet, and as he looked up at Quinn, he tried to swing his sword towards his face, but before he could, he was hit in the air by a great force that threw him away until he was slammed against the ceiling and fell back to the floor.

Now, floating around Quinn were three balls of blood. He had gathered the blood from the dhampir and Lucia around him using his skill.

"You guys tried to hurt someone I promised to look after. I'm sick of losing people I care about." Quinn said.

Walking forward with the blood floating around him, Peter stepped back, and the next second, the blood ball hit one of the men, right in the head, and in the next instant, there was no longer a head on those shoulders. The other two ran forward, but with a flick of his hand, Quinn bashed blood into one, whacking him to the side of the wall, and it was the same with the other.

"Now, we only need one of you alive," Quinn said with his eyes glowing red and the power of a celestial vampire advancing in him.

# Chapter 1582 - Supreme Blood Control

Right now, what Jessica was witnessing without a doubt was blood control. At first, she was unsure who was using it—either the little girl or the strange looking plain vampire she had seen. However, now it was clear.

Blood control was different from blood aura, which is what every vampire had. Blood aura allowed vampires to emit strong attacks such as the blood swipe, blood canon and so on.

However, Blood control was something that only the gifted vampires could do, and it tended to follow the bloodline of the vampire leaders, decedents and more could use it. Still it would vary from vampire to vampire.

With blood control, one could change the direction of their attacks and could even use it to speed up and strengthen their attacks to the next level, which was why right now, Jessica was more amazed than ever.

It was clear that this stranger of a vampire was using just blood control. There was no aura involved in his attacks. The energy didn't even leave his hands, and something that she had never heard of before happened; the vampire was controlling others' blood.

The spilt blood from the dhampir, the blood from the human and of those around him, was under his control.

'His blood control is at such a high level that he can even kill dhampirs with just blood control alone…who is this vampire? Is he one of the originals that I have heard of before? Is that why he knows nothing?' She started to think.

While she was lost in her thoughts, Quinn had already killed the other dhampirs. Honestly, he never did enjoy killing others, but he could sense it; the dhampir's blood lust wasn't settling. At the same time, it was almost as if their lust was allowing them to continue to stand up as if they were mindless zombies.

If he even allowed them a chance to attack and regain their strength, there was a chance Minny could get hurt, and he had already promised to protect her.

'I won't make the same mistake as I did in the past.' Quinn thought as he stared down at the last one left.

Since Peter saw that Quinn had already killed a couple, he quickly helped him deal with the rest. One emotion hadn't come back with Peter, and that was death, and the weight of dying or killing someone didn't bother him at all.

"One left, and I doubt that you were any stronger than the others," Quinn said. "The only reason you're alive is because of luck. Now tell me, do you know of a dhampir that goes by the name of Erin?" Quinn asked.

His influence skill wasn't quite working the way it should have if he was at full power, but even if that was the case, similar to his blood powers, he wondered if that would have made much of a difference in the first place.

Hearing that name, Quinn could tell that the man's heart in front of him began to thump louder than it was seconds ago.

"So you do know her. Where is she? Let me speak to her...wait." Quinn didn't know quite what to say because he didn't really think there would be a relation between the two. At least he hoped there wasn't a relation between the two.

"Step back!" Jessica shouted.

Hearing this, Quinn wondered what her warning was about, and that's when he was the man's face ballooning up, his whole body growing in size. He had seen this once before with one of the Pure Agents, Agent 2.

It was a Qi explosion, but this one seemed to be self-inflicted to cause more destruction before his death.

"The Queen will get rid of you all." The man said before the light started to escape through the cracks in his face. At that moment, Peter appeared directly in front of Quinn.

A loud bang was heard in the room, destroying the ground and the area around them. The girls looked away due to the bright light. When they turned around, though, they could see Quinn was okay.

However, Peter had his skin burst off, including his clothes from the front of his body. It was clear he was in pain.

The attack came as a surprise for more reasons than one. The first was that Quinn never knew that Qi had advanced so far. These didn't seem like talented Dhampirs, so maybe there were others who knew more about this situation, which made him wonder about 0, whether or not the latter was still alive as well.

Regardless, what really concerned him was his shadow. Quinn no longer needed the system to activate his shadow powers, and just as he was about to use it to create a shield to protect him, he realised two things.

I was able to get through his shadow, it acted as a counter, but the second thing was that using the shadow was dangerous. During the fight with Graham, Quinn had used Shadow Overload. In doing so, he had lost a lot of MC cells as the drawback of using the skill.

Right now, he had the Dragon in his shadow space. If Quinn used too much of the shadow, there was a good chance the Dragon would spill out. Not that Quinn was worried Ray would do anything as the Dragon, but it might complicate matters for him in this place.

Placing his hand on Peter, Quinn started to remove the foreign sources of Qi from his body. It was the least he could do for taking the blast for him.

"You know, you're going to have to learn the second stage yourself, or at least learn how to use it properly. Especially if everyone can use it now." Quinn said.

"Unfortunately, I didn't practice during the last thousand years," Peter replied.

Quinn also thought it was unfortunate. He couldn't help but imagine a Peter who would have trained for a thousand years to become unstoppable, but whenever he thought about him just standing there, he didn't know what to say.

Soon, Peter was able to heal himself. The damage wasn't too severe on his body, and honestly, even if Quinn took the hit, he thought the explosion wouldn't have hurt his body either. In this new evolution form, his body felt different from before.

Not just in appearance, either.

Still, he didn't want to tell Peter after what he had already done, but there was a reason why Quinn didn't move despite the warning.

"Hey, so…who is that vampire that you have with you?" Lucia finally asked. She was already interested and now even more so.

"I have no idea," Jessica replied.

The group had exited out of the examination room and gathered in an empty room. It looked like everyone had somewhat left the place. Seconds later, though, people came rushing in, all dressed in the same beast gear.

It was quite the heavy equipment on their body, and all of it was mainly white with blue outlines.

'Did they dye their equipment? I think some people did it back in the day, but it wasn't too popular.' Quinn thought.

However, the guards seemed to ignore their group and ran straight to the training room to assess the situation. Finally entering through the doors was a man dressed in more blue armour than white compared to the others, which made him seem like a more high ranking official.

"Please, do you mind waiting inside here? We will be calling everyone else back in to make a report." The man said in a soft, soothing voice. The others nodded, and during their wait, Quinn decided to sit back in the sofa seats that were off to the side.

The two girls naturally followed, which he wanted to anyway.

"Okay," Quinn said. "I kept up my part of the deal and took the exam with you. Now before those guys come and question us about what happened. I need to know, what is going on, and what happened in the last thousand years?" Quinn asked.

It was time for some answers.

*****

# Chapter 1583 - Three Vampire Groups

It had been a while since Jessica felt her palms sweat. Earlier, she spoke to the vampire in front of her so casually. The simple reason was because of his scent, and it was why she thought that the vampire in front of her was a lower rank than hers.

However, after seeing what he had accomplished, she had different thoughts. Rather than a lowly vampire, she believed that the person she was speaking to now was what was known as an Original vampire—a vampire from the original thirteen families.

'That has to be it, and I am sure he doesn't have amnesia; who the hell could even get close enough to him?' Jessica thought. 'With that Wight by his side and his own strength, no one would even be able to wipe his memories? But if the two of them had only just woken up, it would make sense why they don't remember anything. Especially since he had asked what had happened for the last thousand years.'

Sitting opposite her, Quinn was getting ready to hear some answers. Gulping, she decided to ask a question of her own.

"Who are you?" Jessica eventually asked.

"No." Quinn shook his head. "That wasn't part of the deal. Before I tell you who I am, I need to know what is with this place. Who were those dhampirs that attacked earlier? What is the vampire corps? What happened to the vampires?"

Lucia was able to hear everything being said, and these questions left her a little bit confused, but from the looks of it, the two vampires in front of her didn't know each other that well. Still, rather than interject, she could tell, for some reason, the person in front of her desperately wanted answers and would go to any length to get them.

"Okay, as you said, a deal is a deal, but I just want to say I might not be able to answer all your questions. I'm young myself; I'm only 19 years old." Jesica replied. "So I really only know what's going on currently.

"A thousand years ago, you're asking what happened after the Dalki invasion, correct? After Hero Quinn defeated the Dalki, the world decided to move forward and progress. From that day onward, it was a new year. So we reset the calendar to A.Q., for After Quinn." Jessica explained.

Hearting this, Peter started coughing once again. He wanted to laugh, but Quinn quickly kicked his leg, warning him not to, not at a time like this, although even Quinn found it quite unbelievable.

"After that, the world changed. Vampires, humans, they started to live together. Between then and now, I really don't know what happened, but I can tell more about the current state of the world. I know you probably want to know what became of the thirteen families. But in today's world, they don't really exist, and we just study them to learn more about vampire history.

"At the moment, there are three groups of vampires. The Vampire Corps, like me, are vampires that were or are part of the military. I heard people in the past volunteered to turn into vampires, and to improve relations, the army themselves made their own vampire group."

"Do all the vampires have the same ability as you?" Quinn asked.

"The string ability?" Jessica replied. "Most in the vampire corps do, but not all. It's what is taught to us. We also have subclasses like the Wight you have there. The Vampire Corps is a group that is mostly on Earth."

Quinn wanted to ask more about the fighting on Earth, which the former had mentioned earlier, but he waited to hear about the two other groups of vampires.

"You then have the family vampires. These are vampires that have continued to live in the different solar systems, apart from Earths. I left the vampire corps hoping to live a life like there's, and that's why I came here."

"What is so special about the place we are currently in?" Quinn asked.

"Remember what I said before?" Lucia joined in the conversation. "There are some planets that have strict rules. They don't allow vampires to live on them, no matter what vampire group they are from. However, the Graylash family and their planets have the policy to accept all. A safe haven for all the races. Well, all apart from one, that is."

"The Dhampirs." Quinn guessed based on what Lucia shouted before.

Lucia nodded.

"It's because of the fighting. The Dhampirs hunt vampires, no matter what they have done or what group they are from. They are mainly based on Earth's solar system, and they tend not to meddle on the Graylash planets or enter the other solar systems, but they have been pushing more recently, and the Graylash family are wondering what to do."

"Is that why there is so much hate towards the vampires?" Peter asked.

"Kinda," Jessica replied. "There is more to it than that, a past of some kind. Many people are worried that they are getting dragged into a war they have nothing to do with. The Dhampirs only hunt vampires after all, and because of that, the other groups, including those who live on the Graylash planets, get hurt. Which is why no one would team up with me earlier."

"There is pushback for the Graylash group to change their policy." Lucia interrupted. "However, that would go against our family's policies that many seem to have forgotten."

When saying these words, Lucia sounded a bit sad. Quinn could tell from her tone of voice.

'Did Owen do all this? Or was it him along with the Cursed faction? They really did try to make a place where everyone could live together.'

"The third group of vampires, who are they?" Quinn asked.

"They..they are the reason why the people hate us vampires, and why some even might support what the Dhampir are doing. We refer to them as the Red Vampires. They are a group that wish to turn as many humans as they can into vampires; if not, they choose to kill them.

"I don't know their origins..but they appeared around the same time when the number of Dhampirs began to increase as well," Jessica explained.

Thinking about all the information Quinn had learnt so far, he had a couple of theories. Fex was close to Samantha, and the two of them survived. Perhaps, Fex had decided to join the military alongside her and created the Vampire Corps. This is why many of the thirteenth family knew the String ability.

Over the years, everyone must have started to refer to them as the Vampire Corps, but what happened to the original Thirteen families? Did they just blend into society, or were they hunted by the dhampirs? As for these Red vampires he had a few guesses.

The thirteen families were split, Quinn had taken the absolute blood control, so there was no longer one single ruler who could force them to listen to them. Their traditions all disappeared along with Quinn, and those who wanted to rule over the humans had decided to act. There was one more guess, and that was to do with Laxmus. Quinn never finished him off, perhaps maybe even some vampires went to join him and grew his power, but what about the rest?

"Do you know the dhampir's leader by any chance?" Quinn asked, looking at both of them, but they just shook their heads. It was clear that there was a lot of information they didn't know.

"What about the current Vampire Corps leader? Who is in charge of the military that's fighting on Earth? And is it just against the Vampires or against Pure as well?" Quinn guessed since Pure were initially from the Earth, to begin with. It was the last place he had heard of them anyway.

Whether they won the war back then or not with Leo and Sera, Quinn would get his answer now.

"The Leader...I guess the closest one would be Andy?"

"Who the F*ck is Andy?" Peter frowned.

Although Quinn wouldn't have quite put it quite crudely, he thought the same thing. Since it didn't appear to be Fex or Samantha, something must have happened to them, or they decided to finally get some peace. He was just hoping that they didn't die.

"Your second question, Pure, is also part of the fight. However, they are working with the Dhampirs to get rid of the vampire corps currently on Earth."

'Pure and the dhampirs working together? But Erin would have never worked with Pure. That…makes no sense because she hated them till the very end. Something isn't right, and I need someone who knows more answers.'

Thinking about this led Quinn to his next question.

"Okay, so you don't know the history of how things got this way or how the fighting really started. Only the current groups at the moment, but then what about the Cursed faction. What happened to them? What happened to everyone who was in the Cursed faction?"

Nervous to hear the answer, Quinn clenched his jaw.

"What faction? Cursed...I don't think I've ever heard of such a faction. Were they a big deal…I mean back then?" Jessica asked, thinking that Quinn was still an original.

"You…haven't heard of them?" Quinn softly reacted.

*******

# Chapter 1584 - An Orginal Leader

"Lucia, do you know or have heard of the Cursed faction?" Quinn asked just in case it was something Jessica didn't know. After all, even during Quinn's time, there would be a few that knew the history of the world and what had happened.

The past didn't seem to interest many unless it directly involved them, and right now, he was grasping at straws for a hopeful answer.

"I'm sorry, I don't think I have." She replied, knowing full well that it would upset the person in front of her because Quinn couldn't hide his current mood, which was being reflected on his face.

'How does this make any sense? The world remembers me, the leader of the Cursed faction, but don't remember any of the others? The whole group, everyone had done so much during their time to fend off the Dalki, and only I'm remembered?'

Worse than that, Quinn felt like something must have happened to the members. After all, how could such a strong force, one of the three most prominent factions at the time, be forgotten entirely from the annals of history? Quinn just wanted to know about what happened to his friends more than ever. The current state of the world could wait.

Thinking about it more, Quinn remembered one name, one single name that the two in front of him might know, as he had seen the name even during this time.

"Logan Green, do you know this name?" Quinn asked softly now, trying not to expect too much, as he had been disappointed so far.

The two girls looked at each other, and they had a smile on their faces. Talking to Quinn, it felt like they wanted to give him at least some good news.

"Yes, of course, everyone knows who Logan Green is. He's probably the most famous person in the universe right now." Jessica said in an upbeat tone.

For the first time, Quinn had received good news, but what had Logan done that allowed him to be remembered a 1000 years later. Was it the technology he created, perhaps some great device that everyone in the world uses today?

'Wait, did she say now?'

"He's the current world leader! Of course, we would know him."

Now it was time for Quinn to go into a coughing fit as he began to choke on air. He tried to speak, but his body was doing all strange things due to the shock.

"How...is he still alive?" Quinn asked.

However, the two girls didn't seem to know the answer to that question. Either way, Quinn had finally seen the light. Who he would go to next to find out the answers he needed. If anyone were still alive that would have catalogued all the events that happened in the last thousand years, especially things to do with the Cursed faction, it would have been him.

Standing up from his seat, it looked like Quinn was ready to leave.

"Wait!" Jessica said. "Nate, are you planning to go see him? That's impossible, no one can see him at least not just anyone, and besides, he's on Earth right now. How would you even get there?"

Of course, Quinn felt like he had his ways to make Logan come and see him. All he had to do was show his real body. Although the more he thought about it, it might be hard to convince the guards, but once his system was up and running, he could just use his shadow powers to go through and sneak past whoever was guarding the place where Logan was at. It shouldn't be hard to find the World Leader.

"I just need to find a teleporter that heads back to Earth. I have my own ways. Just tell the guy from earlier that I had to go somewhere." Quinn answered.

His answer had caused the girls to pull some strange faces.

"Teleporter? They are banned for hundreds of years now, and nobody is even allowed to make one of those anymore."

At first, he thought the girls were pulling his leg, but then why would they need to lie to him.

Seeing how the vampire infront of them didn't seem to understand, they went on to explain.

"The enemy and dhampirs frequently used teleporters before for attacks. So every planet has created a blanket ban on them, including Earth. If there is no location to go to, even if you created one, it would lead to nowhere because they aren't active or set location points anymore. There are jammers on all the planets to stop one from reaching a signal. At least that's what we were taught." Jessica answered, clearly not fully understanding its science, getting some parts wrong here and there.

"So I just need a ship, but for that, I'll need some money." It was then Quinn looked at Jessica, wondering if she would be willing to lend him some.

"No way, I hardly have any for myself. Why do you think I was here in the first place!" She immediately replied.

Considering other ways, Quinn thought about shadow link. He could travel to unknown places as long as any of his old friends had their shadow ability active. The question was, was there anyone. At the moment, he couldn't feel anyone at all.

While Quinn was trying to figure out a way out of this problem, Lucia was the one who had come up with an answer. She soon stood up from her seat, and she too was clenching her fists as she was getting ready to speak.

"Nate!" Lucia called out, and Quinn had forgotten that was his name for a second. "I don't know who you are, but you asked about the history of a thousand years ago, right? Does that mean you have memories of what happened thousand years ago, that you were there during the time the Dalki attacked, right?"

Quinn wondered if he should tell the girls the truth for a second. Whether they would believe who he was, but he still didn't know how much weight his name carried. People now saw him as a fallen hero, and telling them who he was might even cause another war.

Even in that room where the assessment was to take place, arguments were happening, and Quinn didn't even know who the enemy was right now. How could he help the people when he himself needed the most help at the moment. And most of all, although selfish, he wanted to figure out what happened to his friends first, before helping out the people.

"You're an original, right? One of the original vampires?" Jessica asked, interested to know as well.

Quinn had gotten the answer of how to get out of his current predicament.

"That's correct, I was there thousand years ago, and yes, I am an original vampire. After the war, I was injured and hurt along with my friends. We went to sleep, and that's why I want to know what happened. If what you say is true and Logan Green is still alive, then I'm hoping to talk to him and ask him about what has happened."

The answer seemed to satisfy the two girls, but there was a reason why Lucia wanted to ask.

"If that's the case, then I'll help you. I'll pay for you to go back to Earth and meet with Logan Green, but before that, I was hoping that you could do me a favour. Could we please…visit the Graylash family leader.

"That's all I ask, for you to visit our leader before you go visit Logan Green," Lucia asked.

'The Graylash family leader.' Hearing these words, Owen's face appeared in Quinn's mind, but it would be impossible for him to be still alive. Thinking about him, Quinn remembered that at one point in time, even though the latter was helpful, he wished to rule the world, turning everyone to lighting users, but looking at the society and the current world, something had changed in him.

'Maybe, the current leader would know a bit more about the current situation, especially about the Dhampirs and what happened to the Cursed faction as well. I owe him and his family for their help.'

"Sure, let's go see the Graylash family leader." Quinn smiled.

*****

# Chapter 1585 - Dangerous Rumors

Although there was a lot that the girls were not aware of, Quinn still wanted to ask a few more questions about the current state of the world. Who was currently winning the fight, just how big these forces were and so on, but before he could, the strange armoured soldiers from before came back from the examination room.

At the same time, he checked his system for an update. The syncing process was increasing significantly.

[22 Percent of the system has been synced]

'Maybe in a few hours, my body will be back to normal.' Quinn thought.

The only one who approached the group was the man in the blueish armour from before.

Quinn noticed that before talking to them, the former rubbed the ring around his finger as he got close, an action he saw many do, which made him wonder what exactly it was that they were feeling.

"Sorry for the trouble, and thank you for staying." The man politely said. "The name is Ron Stein. I'm from the primary group in the Graylash family and also the current Leader of the planet we stand on. I wished to come to this case myself once I heard the Dhampirs were involved."

The man seemed quite polite, but honestly, Quinn knew nothing about what the man was telling him right now because he was unaware of the structure in the Graylash family in the first place.

"I'm afraid it is quite tricky for us to test the dhampirs, as you know our rings don't work on them as they do on you. They appear human, just like the others. I have alerted the other vampires on this planet, just in case there are more of these Dhampirs.

"Anyway, enough of my explanations, I wanted to ask, were you guys the ones that dealt with the dhampirs?"

The girls looked at each other, wondering what they should reveal. After all, who would believe that they were the ones to beat them.

"Yes," Quinn answered. "I am a vampire from one of the families; I was helping out my fellow Vampire Corps member take the assessment since no one wanted to team up with her. It was a coincidence that I was here to help."

The man was surprised by the answer and looked Quinn up and down and those around him. To the man, Quinn in front of him looked rather plain but what surprised him was that he was strong enough to take out the dhampirs.

"I see." The man replied. "Well, none of you look seriously hurt, apart from Lucia there, but we should be able to take her back and heal her." The man sighed.

It was then that Quinn realised that the man had known Lucia's name without even asking for it. Perhaps the two were acquainted with each other.

"Ron," Lucia said. "I promised that for saving my life that I would let them see our Leader as thanks. These vampires were attacked when they were meant to feel safe on this planet, so I was hoping that we could at least allow them to meet our Leader."

It was then that Ron gave Lucia a strange look as if to say did she really suggest such a thing? However, in defeat, he sighed again.

"I don't know what you promised them, Lucia, though, I do agree that we should reward these guys. Not only were they attacked, but they eliminated the threat. Still, I'm worried that this might lead the enemy to send more forces here.

"Still, either way, I can take you to the Graylash home ship; from there, it will be all up to you, Lucia; you can't promise them something unless you can deliver it. We still need to talk to all the others, and while we are on our journey, I will get you to write a full report." Ron shook his head and was off.

When he finally left, Jessica turned towards Lucia.

"Are you some big shot in the Graylash family or something? The Leader's daughter?"

"No!" Lucia replied, quickly shaking her hands. "It is nothing like that. I can explain more when we get there, but I guarantee Nate will meet the Leader if he says that he was one of the Originals who fought during the war.

After waiting a while, the group was informed that today's test results would be void, and because the place would need to be repaired, they would have to come back later and retake the Traveller test when they were ready.

It was pretty clear that Jessica wasn't pleased about it at all, and finally, after interrogating others who were on the scene, Ron, from the Graylash family, returned, ready to pick them up.

But just as they were about to leave, Jessica spoke, "Hey, wait, I'm coming with you guys!"

"You are?" Lucia asked.

"She is?" Peter said, looking towards Quinn.

"Of course, I am. I have no money, I can't even become a Traveller and, don't you have more questions for me? I could be your guide or something!" Jessica said.

"I mean, I don't mind," Lucia replied and looked towards Quinn.

"Sure," Quinn answered, and all of them got on board the medium-sized vessel that was waiting outside. It looked like they had special small spacecraft designed for the police force in the city.

While onboard the ship, Lucia explained a little about who Ron was to Quinn. Actually, he was the planet leader and would have to report back to the Graylash family, but he wasn't directly part of the Graylash family line.

However, although she herself wasn't related to the current Leader, she was related to one of the original founders of the Graylash family, which is why Ron had listened to her request.

Relaxing in the metallic break room, Quinn was looking out at the city. He could see it really did seem more endless with Urban and suburban areas spread all around. Then finally, he saw the wall. However, the wall wasn't surrounding the city.

It seemed like a continuous path until it linked up to different areas, and he could then see a few stray people in these open areas. It looked like the whole city was the planet because there was more housing and buildings than empty landscapes.

Though, there were indeed a few open landscapes where people could go out for a hunt.

'The human population was low back then, but after a thousand years, it has increased exponentially.' Quinn thought, which made him think of something else.

"The vampire settlement," Quinn said but corrected himself. "I'm sorry, I mean, is there a vampire settlement? I know you said that the leaders are really non-existent, but there were castles and tombs of the other originals during my time. Is there still such a place?"

Jessica had paused before answering, which Quinn realised was not a good sign.

"Not really." Jessica eventually replied. "I have no clue about that, honestly. Maybe someone would know, but I don't know much about the family vampires.

"But, there definitely isn't a place like that which is publicly known. When we get to earth, I can speak to my commander. He might introduce you to someone who is high up in the vampire ranks."

Quinn wondered why Jessica was being so nice to him; she had no reason to, even less since traditions no longer existed, even if he was an original vampire. However, he soon realised why as she went on to ask her own question.

"So I was wondering, you were there... I mean, you said you were there during the war a thousand years ago, right?" Jessica asked, to which Quinn nodded, not quite sure where this was going yet. "I just wanted to ask…do you know what type of person Quinn Talen was? Like who was he? There are a lot of rumours about him from back then."

"Rumours?" Peter replied, as he now was interested in the conversation too. "What type of rumours?" He asked, leaning on his friend.

"Like, he was quite the butterfly and laid with a new woman every night?" Jessica said with a bright red face.

Leaning, Peter lowered his head; his shoulders moved up and down radically as he tried hard to control his laugh.

'Who the hell spread these rumours….' Quinn thought.

*****

# Chapter 1586 - A Fourth Energy

When Quinn had heard the first rumour about himself, quite frankly, he wanted to stop there. The first one already was far from the truth, and it was clear that Jessica was freely talking about him right to his face because she didn't know who he was.

However, one person wouldn't allow that to happen, and that was Peter.

"Oh really, well, I would say that was pretty accurate. If he ever wanted a girl to come towards him, Quinn could just give them a wink, and they would flock after him." Peter chimed in. "Go ahead; what other rumours did you hear, and I will be happy to clarify them."

"Oh, there were lots," Jessica said with a smile. "A human turned vampire, who was the strongest vampire in history who ever lived. A kind-hearted king who used to cry every time one of his people was killed."

"Well…I mean." Quinn honestly didn't know how to reply to those. Sure he cried a few times when those close to him died, but who hadn't done it, but the way Jessica phrased it, it made him feel like the rumours were too exaggerated.

"Sometimes, when fighting his enemies, he would cry even while killing them!" Jessica said.

Hearing all this, Peter was just nodding his head along.

"Are there any strange rumours about him?" Peter asked, wanting to hear something far more interesting like the first one.

The two girls seemed to be thinking about it for a while. When Quinn honestly just wanted it to stop, he couldn't even defend himself.

"There was one, that he got his power from Virgin blood," Lucia said. "That he would only consume the blood of virgins because it made him stronger, then there's the rumour that is the complete opposite of the first one, how Quinn's strength came because he was a virgin. Even when he had the chance right in front of him, the girls all around him, he would brush them off because he needed to keep his strength."

"That's not true!" Quinn shouted out. He then cleared his throat as the rest stared at him. "I mean, based on what I saw, that was not true. Quinn was just far too busy during those times. There was always something coming up that's why he couldn't…anyway, I'm tired; I think I should get some sleep before we reach our destination. And Lucia, I'll ask you about the Graylash family when I wake up. For you Jessica I'll send you a list of all the Cursed members, and let me know if any of them stand out or you have seen and heard their name before."

It was then Quinn left, and soon the other two followed him out of the room. However, Jessica knew something was weird. Vampires don't get so tired, and at least to her, it didn't look like 'Nate' was that tired. In her opinion, if one had just woken up after so long, the last thing they would want to do is go back to sleep.

"I guess speaking about Quinn around him might be a sensitive matter," Jessica said.

"You might be right. For us, he is just a hero talked about in legends, but for him, it was someone he was probably close to. We shouldn't be so insensitive about this." Lucia replied.

It was a shame because Jessica also wanted to ask her a few questions about Nate himself. What family was he from and so on, but she just had let herself get carried away.

There was a small restroom with bunk beds, it wasn't in the best of conditions, but the ship they were on wasn't too spacious in the first place. Still, Quinn just wanted to get away from the two girls. He really didn't want to hear any more rumours about himself; he couldn't even see the looks on the girls' faces as they talked about each one.

'Yeah, and now, if I reveal myself in front of them, they're going to be like, 'Oh, why didn't you tell us that you were actually the Hero Quinn' It would just be an awkward conversation for both of us.' Quinn sighed.

Still, at least there weren't any nasty rumours about him, it was the upside to the whole thing, but he still felt glum about the cursed faction.

"Hey, you didn't have to run off like that. I'm only having a bit of fun." Peter said as he entered the room.

"If you have time for fun, I would suggest that you practice your Qi," Quinn replied. "Dhampirs will be after us from now on, and from the sounds of it, they have created quite a large army. All of those that we fought today, their Qi control was better than yours, and what would have happened if I wasn't with you?" Quinn asked.

Although Peter seemed to be in a playful mood, he agreed and decided to ask Quinn for his help. The two of them went through the process, and after explaining everything Quinn could, it was now all up to Peter.

However, based on what little they had been going through so far, Peter was probably the most untalented person Quinn had come across in terms of controlling Qi. So it would perhaps take a while.

"What about me? You can teach me as well!" Minny said with a smile.

"Ah, there's no need for you to learn Qi, Minny. You should just stay with the two of us. As long as you do, we will be able to protect you." Quinn said.

"But what if we get separated for some reason, like…like…like.. mommy and me.." Minny started to cry as she thought of her mother.

Peter had given Quinn a look telling him to fix the situation he had somewhat caused. Panicking, Quinn thought whether he should teach her because she was partly right, but then another idea popped into his head.

"You don't have an ability, do you, Minny?" Quinn asked.

She shook her head and continued to sniffle.

"Then how about I teach you how to use Arthur's ability. I can teach you a little bit now and then the rest of it later. Then whenever you're in trouble, no matter where you are, I can come right by your side when you need me." Quinn suggested.

Smiling back, Minny seemed to relish the suggestion and nodded. Once again, Quinn went through the simple shadow techniques he had used before. This reminded him of the time he had taught the shadow to the others, but there were different stages one had to go through first before they could even summon the shadow.

"Now remember Minny, don't teach anyone this, and only use it if you really need to. You can't let people see this ability, okay." Quinn said.

He realised then it was a question he forgot to ask about. Whether or not the shadow ability was also passed to the future generations. Others like Dennis and Sam knew the shadow ability and perhaps may have taught it to others. But if they hadn't, then it would be a dead giveaway to who he was.

If anything, it would put a large target on his back. After finishing teaching Minny and Peter, Quinn felt a weird sensation because something strange had happened to him.

[63 percent of the system has now synced.]

Ever since Quinn had done combat with the dhampirs, his system was syncing far quicker than it had done before. Whether it was just like a loading bar that suddenly sped up, or if it was coincidence or not, Quinn didn't know.

So he decided to try and meditate, focusing on his blood aura, among other things in his body, to hopefully speed up the syncing process. The other two were busy in their own practice, so Quinn closed his eyes without any worry and knew he wouldn't be disturbed.

'Controlling the blood in my body, before there were three different energies inside…but now...I can feel four. This fourth energy, though, is so little. Less than all the rest. Maybe if I focus on this.'

Eventually, focusing on the tiny newfound energy in his body, Quinn could feel his body syncing quicker, getting back to what it once was during his fight with Graham, and at the same time, he heard a prompt.

[The new system has completely synced with your body]

[Your system's upgrade is complete]

[You have fully unlocked the Celestial Vampire System.]

*****

# Chapter 1587 - System 2.0

When absorbing the Nest Crystal, Quinn knew that his body was going through an evolution. Although it stated that his system was getting an upgrade, it felt more like he was the one that was changing. However, becoming the celestial vampire made him realise that he and the system were more linked than before. It was as if their body was one.

Quinn always used to see the system as something helpful, a tutorial almost of how to become a vampire. Vincent had even explained it to be that way. Now though, it had evolved into something else.

At the time of the great fight, Quinn was just making what came to him and his mind naturally, which allowed him to take out Graham. Because of it, he had drawn far too much power for his new body to handle, and it had made him end up in the current situation he was in now. Whatever the reason, he didn't want to do that now, so he needed to read everything carefully.

[Celestial Vampire System]

[Level 1]

'Level 1? Is it because the system has been upgraded that it's restarting me from level 1? But it's not a reset; I can tell my body is just as strong as it was before.

[HP 100/100]

[Strength 200]

[Agility 200]

[Stamina 200]

[Charm 200]

[Blood control (Title effect applied): Infinite]

In one way looking at Quinn's current stats, he was expecting them to have increased after evolving, but in a way, it made sense. When fighting against Graham, there was a reason why Quinn hadn't fought him head-on using his fist and legs, because although evolving, his body hadn't improved.

If he was to punch his enemy head-on, he was sure he would lose out in a battle of strength, but using the blood aura inside of him and using the blood control to power if further, it was what allowed him to make forces and attacks beyond what Graham could handle.

'I wonder, now that the level has reset, does that mean my body can increase even further if I level up?' Quinn wondered; that's when he noticed something else as well. There was no exp bar. If there was no exp bar, how was he meant to level up? Would it be by doing quests just like he had done before, ones that would reward him instant level up or something else.

looking at the level icon again; Quinn pressed a small little 'i' next to it that wasn't there before, which allowed another system screen to appear in front of him—explaining details which weren't there before.

'Haha, an upgraded system means this thing can be useful for once!' Quinn thought.

[For a celestial being, there are up to a maximum of ten different levels. At each level, a new divine power will be unlocked. Level 1 (Celestial energy is now available) There is more than one way to level up for a celestial being. The more followers a celestial has following its set condition will provide the user with more Celestial energy.

[If a Celestial loses followers, then the energy will also lower, meaning the user can go down in levels. Another way for a celestial to level up is facing other celestials and absorbing their power. That power will temporarily belong to the celestial until the Celestial is reincarnated into the universe. (Note your current level does not allow you to reincarnate. If a Celestial is to die and they have no followers, there will not be able to reincarnate.)]

It was a head-scratcher for sure, but Quinn was glad that he was provided with some explanation. The more he was reading about it, the more it reminded him of the beings like Bliss that he had met, but there was still missing information he didn't know yet, such as celestial energy and the set condition it was talking about. Followers didn't make much sense to him either.

While looking at his stats, Quinn noticed that his blood control was infinite, and apparently, that was due to the title he had gained, so he wanted to look at that next.

'I remember a little bit, before becoming a celestial, it took all my blood items and armour off me. I thought that the blood armour in my shadow was safe, but when trying to summon it. Arthurs and the king's blood armour is gone, including that of my gauntlet. To take all those things, this title better be worth it.'

When looking at his titles, Quinn noticed that all of them had currently disappeared. There wasn't the king's title, and there weren't any of the others either. All apart from one.

[Ruler of Blood]

[The title allows the user to use any blood skills without taking any of the user's health. Blood control can be used on all types of blood as long as it has left their body. The title also allows the user to have maximum blood control. Depending on the amount of blood available, the user can control it.]

[While title is active: All Blood skills are at the maximum level]

[While the title is active: All blood skills have been unlocked]

Thinking about this, it made sense and allowed Quinn to control the Dalki blood during his fight with Graham, including all the others. Still, if it claimed that it wouldn't affect his body, why had it done so before.

'Was it because my body hadn't completely finished going through its evolution, did I rush it, or was it something else? Maybe my body just needed sleep after becoming this thing.' Quinn wondered, but it was something that the system itself seemed like it couldn't answer.

Still, he had seen how powerful this Ruler of blood title was. Even if his body was weak, Quinn could kill a dhampir at the knight level with just a drop of blood.

Checking out the other things in his system, some things were no longer there. The name of all the vampires he could once summon. It was one of the effects of his title, so either it was because all of the title effects were no longer there, or it was due to them no longer being alive.

At the same time, he was right; all of his current connections to the vampires just weren't there anymore. Quinn's best guess was just because now he had become a being above them. No longer a vampire that had created them, but someone who had transcended above them. It made him think of a specific individual, and perhaps that barrier with them would no longer be there if they were alive, of course.

What was still there was Quinn's shadow abilities, although his current MC cells were nothing compared to what they once were. He had 8234 MC cells, and half of that was being used to contain the dragon in his shadow lock.

It was safe to say that his shadow skills were no longer what they once used to be. With such a small amount of MC cells, he could only use them for the other benefits they provided rather than being useful in a fight. Not unless he increased them to what they once were again.

Just as stated, all of the blood skills were now at level 5, maxing them out, and there were a few new skills that Quinn had never got the chance to learn. Such as the blood canon, and even more that he hadn't seen other vampires use so much.

'I guess there's no need to train them, and since they don't take my health anymore, does that mean I could continually use blood canons without worrying? Blood furry swipe without stopping? And same with the blood shield.'

Now Quinn was starting to realise the incredible effects of the ruler of blood title. Essentially he didn't just have excellent blood control, but an unlimited amount of blood aura to use the blood skills as he wished. While blood control relied on the blood of others around him, this still helped even when there was no blood around him.

Finally, looking at all the old parts of his system, it was time for Quinn to look at what exactly was new. Because staring at him in the face, he could see a new tab, stating Celestial energy.

*****

# Chapter 1588 - Celestial Energy

After having looked at everything else so far, what Quinn was most interested in was the new celestial tab that had appeared in his system. After some description of his current state, he hoped to find answers to the questions he had.

'The red aura, being the vampire energy, the yellow energy of Qi, and the shadow energy of my current MC cells. They were the three energies I could feel in my body from before, and now I can feel the fourth energy, white energy. This new energy that I now feel has to be the Celestial Energy.' Quinn thought as he selected the tab.

[Celestial Being Level: 1]

[Celestial Energy: 10]

[Current dedicated followers: 0]

The first thing that Quinn saw was already explained to him, but the value number seemed to be relatively low for the Celestial Energy itself, which was expected based on how much energy Quinn could feel inside his body.

'Current dedicated followers? Is that what the system was talking about, a way to increase my energy?'

Clicking the 'i' icon next to Celestial Energy's description, a few paragraphs of text popped up, explaining a little more.

[Celestial Energy is an energy that the user can use to combat against other Celestials. It can damage other Celestials and their followers compared to other basic skills.]

Reading this made Quinn wonder if adding Celestial Energy would help him increase his current strength and powers or if it was something, like the system stated, to be only used for fighting against Celestial Beings and their followers? If it was the latter, it wasn't something urgent he felt like improving. Besides Bliss and Sera, he couldn't think of anyone else who would perhaps be referred to as celestials.

'Maybe the other god whom Richard contacted as well...that could be one.'

Still, a lot could had happened in the current times, and he wouldn't completely disregard it just yet. MAybe the current world had more gods that were roaming around.

[To increase your Celestial Energy, followers must meet a certain condition]

[Condition: Followers must offer blood while thinking of the celestial. You will receive more energy if blood is offered before a figure or icon of the said celestial, i.e. a statue. Followers are to continue meeting the condition once a month for the Celestial Energy to remain.]

Reading the condition required to increase Celestial Energy made Quinn shake his head. According to what information he had learnt from before, the condition that would be set would be different for each celestial. Perhaps because of what Quinn was, he required those to sacrifice blood.

He imagined that other gods had easier ways to increase their energy. Maybe just doing good deeds, a prayer, a war, would be other ways.

'This isn't really something I can go around telling people to do, but is there a difference between followers and dedicated followers then.' Quinn thought as he continued to explore the rest of the system.

[Celestial Skills]

[Clesital marking]

[A Celestial Marking can be given to others turn them into a dedicated follower]

[The user can transfer Celestial Energy to a dedicated follower to increase their power.]

[Those with a Celestial Marking will die along with the celestial, even if they are to be reincarnated]

This sounded similar to Quinn's current Demon tier weapon that could give energy to others. A difference was if he made a mark, perhaps he could give them energy no matter where they were. The only thing he was confused about was just how much Celestial Energy would be enough to power up the followers who had a marking in the first place. Since his energy was already low, maybe it would make next to know difference.

The only downside was that if Quinn died, the rest of his dedicated followers would die as well.

'The drawback isn't too bad, but having others' lives in my hands is a bit scary. I would have to test this on someone who really trusts me, and I guess I have a good subject right next to me.' Quinn thought as he glanced at Peter, who was still trying to practice his Qi.

Still, it made him wonder if this was the same thing that Bliss once talked about. A way to cure the vampires was to defeat the god that turned Richard and the others, but was that true? Because now, according to the system, if he killed the god, all of the vampires would most probably die.

However, it was unclear if vampires counted as followers of the particular god in question or just another power that gods gained once they reached a certain level of strength. Since what would the marking be if that was the case.

[Celestial Drain]

[Celestial Energy can be drained from other celestials once killed using this skill. The skill also works on dedicated followers once killed.]

Other than that, there really wasn't much to the system. It didn't state how much Celestial Energy Quinn needed to reach the next level, nor what he would unlock. Honestly, Quinn thought it would have been quite easy if he had had this system in the past.

As King of the vampires, he would have already had a lot of followers, and he could have easily met the condition which would have granted him more power. Then there was the Cursed faction. Although harder to explain, perhaps he could have made it a condition or a ritual for everyone to give blood.

Right now, though, Quinn had no one to follow him, and if he asked others of such things, other than those close to him, people probably would think he was a mad man.

'Everything that is happening...is it because of these gods trying to gain more energy for themselves? Then what about Bliss? Can I really trust her?' Quinn thought.

'I told you not to trust her too much.' Ray replied. 'Although she has helped so far, whatever the case, it would be for her own cause. It always seemed that way. Perhaps this Celestial Energy is the same hunger she talked about, and hers is just how many lives she saves. The more lives she saves, the more Celestial Energy she earns.

'What I do realise, Quinn, is that in this world, there always seems to be a balance. If Bliss's condition is to save lives, then there is sure to be a god out there whose condition is to take lives. I'm not too fond of this… in fact, I don't like this at all.'

Quinn agreed with Ray, but unlike him, it seemed like the latter was becoming closer to what he hated. Letting out a big sigh, all Quinn could really do was protect those he cared about.

Thinking about it more, now that his body was back to normal, Quinn wanted to test it out. He wanted to see the level of his current strength. On top of that, he also wanted to see what his Celestial Energy could do. He was sure that his sudden command over Minny when the latter went berserk during the test and how he had held her back wasn't because of blood powers.

It didn't state in the Ruler Of Blood title that Quinn could control blood aura. But if this was a part of his celestial powers then, it would be worth trying to figure out ways to increase it somehow. Quinn started to gather the blood aura in his hand, and soon, he collected it into a ball-like shape, similar to that of a blood swipe but in a circular form. Then, he placed his Qi in his body, which was no less than before, and finally, he wanted to add the new white energy to see just how strong it was.

But before he could, there was a knock on the metal door. Quinn quickly dispersed all the energy that he had gathered in his hand. He realised there wasn't really anything he could use or test it on in the first place, at least not in this small room, not unless he wanted to explode the whole ship.

"Uhm, Nate, sorry to disturb you," Lucia said, standing by the door. "But we have arrived; we have landed on the main Graylash ship."

# Chapter 1589 - Too Much Change

Not only Quinn but all three of them had been diligently practising that they couldn't hear or feel that the ship had already landed. Looking at the other two, Quinn was somewhat proud because they took the current situation seriously.

"Right, Peter?" Quinn called out, already having gotten up, but the other two were still sitting on the beds. "You are just practising and not just daydreaming or something, right?"

Now that he thought about it, Peter had achieved this new talent, to empty his mind as if he was meditating, not even knowing that time had passed.

"Could you let it go, playboy?" Peter smiled and got up from his bed.

As they stepped out of the ship, they noticed that those who had come with them would soon be leaving back to the last planet they were on. As it lifted into the air, before Quinn could even say goodbye, leaving him with the two girls. Waiting to greet Quinn and the party were more Graylash members. However, none of them wore the white robes that Quinn saw in his time. Instead, they all wore heavy pieces of armour on their body, similar to the guards he saw in the Travellers building on the last planet.

Looking around, it was hard to tell if they were on a ship or on a planet, and Quinn was smiling at this fact because it was one aspect of the Graylash family that didn't seem to have changed. Other than a practical spaceship that they could use for space battle, they went for one that felt more like home.

It was as if they were on a giant piece of moving land. There was also the sound of flowing water, birds flying from the trees, and temples off in the distance. Currently, they were on the bottom level, and the ship had its own set of open land with buildings and landscapes at different levels, similar to a layered wedding cake.

Only these layers were able to support a significant number of people. The Graylash people managed to survive through the years and still held considerable influence, yet the Cursed faction had not; something seriously had to have happened.

"Lucia, we are glad you have come back." A man said as he bowed down slightly towards her.

"Thank you, Gerard. I will cut to the chase why I am here." Lucia said. "Right next to me, I have one of the Vampire Originals. I want to request a meeting between Leader Zinon and these guests by my side. I'm sure the leader will be interested as this vampire Original claims he was a part of the great war thousand years ago."

Hearing this, the Graylash members all looked at each other, and finally, Gerald, who was out front, had decided.

"I will inform our superiors, and they will pass on the message to Leader Zinon; in the meantime, why don't we escort you back to your home on the second level."

"No need, I can escort them myself," Lucia replied, which gave the others nervous looks. "I can guarantee you they are not Dhampirs. If they are to attack this place, I will take full responsibility."

Once again, the men had to make a decision, but in the end, they allowed her to do as she wished. The others left the open area, which meant they were somewhat on their own. However, they were never truly on their own because the giant spaceship was like a planet with several people moving and training everywhere, not to mention the guards around them who had their eyes and ears vigilant at all times.

Looking at those training, Quinn noticed that many of them were using weapons while practising the lighting ability. Although the Graylash members did use weapons during their time, it was completely different. The weapon seemed to be more of tha main focus.

Currently, the group was walking through what looked like an ancient style town. There got a few stares from the others here and there, but eventually, the people didn't pay much attention and got back to their day.

While walking, a few seemed to greet Lucia as well. Some were more sincere greetings and were formal. While others Quinn could hear them talking about her.

"Why do the others still treat her like she is some royal of the Graylash family, her family and especially her haven't done anything special for the group in a long time."

Quinn wasn't sure if he could hear it, and even if she did, it seemed more like a regular occurrence to her.

"The traditional Graylash clothing, why did they get rid of it, or maybe I should ask why are you the only one still wearing it?" Quinn finally asked. It had been on his mind, and even more so now after seeing all the others.

"I knew you were different." Lucia smiled. "You said you approached me because of my clothing, but not many know that this used to be the old clothing of the Graylash family. You see, my family used to be quite close to the leader of the Graylash family in the past.

"I heard that the Graylash family prided themselves on their ability, calling it the world's strongest. The light cloth, made from a special set of beasts, was designed to use our powers freely. However, the family has forgotten this fact some way down the line. Now, they use armour and weapons to boost their powers even more than in the past. I guess you could just say that my side of the family are traditionalists.

"However, our influence within the Graylash family is no longer too deep since our own power has weakened, but I wish to change that."

When hearing their conversation earlier, Quinn realised that the current leader's name was Zinon. He had prepared himself for Owen to no longer be alive, but at the same time, he held on to small hope because confirming that Owen was dead perhaps would mean the others were dead as well.

Quinn was about to ask a few more questions, but that's when he could see, on the lowest tier in the middle of this town once again, there was bigger than a life-size statue of himself.

"I heard that the Graylash family was close to the hero. He had a deep respect for the hero, which is why on every one of the planets, you will find statues of him." Lucia smiled. "We all grew up hearing great tales about him, and that is why we are so determined to follow his wish, to make the world a place where everyone can live in harmony."

Although Quinn didn't exactly like the big statues of himself, he really did appreciate that Owen tried to make the world a better place, and in a lot of ways, it was a better place than the one Quinn had grown up in. It made it feel like the victory wasn't for nothing.

After passing through the first tier, they reached the second tier, and here, there were far fewer houses and people roaming the streets. Obviously, there would be even fewer people at the very top, where the current leader resided.

They were led to the very edge of the second tier, where a temple-like house could be seen. It was a large one but hadn't been kept up too well. Upon entering the home, they didn't sense anyone else in it.

"Is this your family home?" Quinn asked.

"Yes, don't worry, you are free to come inside. All my family…they're all dead." Lucia said, still smiling while saying those words towards them. The others looked at each other and wanted to ask more, but it might not be polite, so they refrained.

"Feel free to make yourself at home, or if you want to stretch, there is a garden that has a view of the whole ship at the back. It's a nice place to relax, and I'm sorry, I don't have any blood, but I'm happy to let you feast on my own if you would like." Lucia said.

"I'm okay," Jessica answered. "Us, in the Vampire Corps, practice going without blood for long periods, so you don't have to worry about that.

It was the first time Quinn had met a human openly offering their blood like so. It certainly was strange and perhaps something he would take a while to get used to.

"We'll be okay," Quinn answered for the rest. "You must be tired, get some sleep, and I would like to head to that garden you just talked about if you don't mind."

The others decided to head outside along with Quinn. While making their way, they stepped inside what looked like a training hall, and in the training hall itself, there were several photos framed above of certain people, men, women and more.

Looking at them all, Quinn stopped at one as he recognised him.

"Robin Graylash…so this is the family you belong to.."

Robin Graylash was indeed a high ranking member of the Graylash family in the past. He was assigned to help the Cursed faction take down a demon tier beast, and during that time, Robin was taken over. In the end, Quinn had no choice but to deal with him himself, but he never expected to reconnect with someone here.

'Is it my fault that this family lost its place…' Quinn thought as he continued to head outside.

Whatever the case was, he had to defeat the demon tier beast at the time.

It wasn't much of a garden as they stepped out; most of the flowers planted had wilted, and the ground was hard and rocky—a solid yellow. This place was more like a desert than a garden.

They could see several strikes on the ground, footprints, and more. It looked like Lucia used this as her training space more than anywhere else. The area was big enough, it was huge, and on top of that, the sight certainly was beautiful, as one could see the tier of land below them and people far below in the distance.

"I'm so bored! When are we going to look for Mommy?" Minny asked. It was a conversation that Quinn still hadn't gone through with her.

"If you bored, try to practice what I taught you-"

Quinn noticed a shadow cast from above, which made him pause. It looked like a giant bird as it flew towards them. As soon as it was close enough, a young man with long straight hair started to descend and landed right in front of them.

"I heard that there was an original vampire here; I came as soon as possible to see if that was true." The young man said.

His wings were spread out proudly on his back but didn't look like part of his body; instead, they looked attached to the armour around his chest. The armour was dark in colour, a dark blue, and the wings were furred but looked heavy and as hard as steel.

Quinn stared at the young man as veins popped upon his head.

"Why does my body feel so weird...," Minny said as she crossed her arms around herself shaking, Peter moved and stood next to her as if to cover her. But she wasn't the only one feeling strange; Jessica could feel it as well. The tingling was all over her as if the blood was rushing throughout her body.

Peter could tell Quinn was beyond angry as the latter's eyes glowed red seeing the young man.

"Tell me!" Quinn shouted with a booming voice letting out an aura of Qi, which shook the whole surface beneath their feet. Even the young man who had just arrived was covered in sweat; seeing this, he too felt his body numb just standing in front of this person.

"Where did you get that Demon tier armour from?!" Quinn questioned.
