# Chapter 1570 - The Final Breath

The large group that had remained on the Daisy Planet stood around Quinn. They had left the bodies of the other dead to rush and save the one they deemed the most important of them all.

As stated before, each of them agreed that if anyone needed to survive this battle, to survive this war, because they had worked harder than anyone else, it would be Quinn. As the group stood around him, two of them approached Quinn on the ground.

Vincent was the first to arrive, along with Logan. The two of them quickly got to work, as Logan had used his spiders to create a strange device around his body, and they formed something like a chest piece over himself.

The chest piece started to compress when the spiders finally formed, beating hard in the specific chest area. The special device worked like a compression unit, simulating a heartbeat, although a regular heartbeat rather than a vampire's.

"How is he?" Owen eventually asked.

Hearing this question, Logan, who seemed to be one who showed a lack of emotions, lifted his head and looked at all of those around him. Eventually, he couldn't look at their faces anymore and decided to squint and concentrate on Quinn instead.

"I'll be honest. I'm just doing whatever I can, whatever little I think I can to help him. Although I'm not a doctor, the technology that I can create and use can be comparable to any top doctor. Right now, this device is acting as if his body is brain dead. If the machine can simulate signs of life, maybe we can do something." Logan explained. "I'm sure you all know…I'm sure you can tell by the fact that I'm using this; right now, he's-"

Dennis placed his hand on Logan's shoulder, stopping the latter from finishing his words, at least not until they confirmed everything.

"See what you did!" Layla shouted, turning to her side and grabbing Peter by his shirt, "Because you didn't let us stop him, because of you, now he's dead…I should... I should...!"

"You should do what?!" Peter said as he quickly twisted Layla's hand, who was entirely overwhelmed by his mistake.

"Layla, you think just because you are a girl that you cared for him more than I f*cking did!" Peter shouted back. "He saved my life at the military academy, he saved my life when the Dalki attacked me, and he's been freaking saving our lives this whole damned time.

"If he tells me to let him do as he wishes, the person who did all of this for us, then I'm going to do what he says!"

While the two were arguing, Vincent had called over Katori. She was pretty tired, having used her powers on mostly healing Vorden, Peter and Vincent himself, but of course, she knew she had to try her best to mend the injuries on Quinn.

Her hands were lighting up all over Quinn's body, but nothing was changing, neither the wounds on his body nor his long hair. Quinn's state remained the same, something Katori had never experienced before.

"Wait, I still might have some Dalki blood, maybe it can help, and let's give him some human blood too," Fex said as he pulled out his flask. He still had some of One Horn's blood with him, which he hadn't used in the war.

He knew fighting against Graham that it was useless for him to use One Horn's blood, and at the same time, the Dalki blood, especially one of a high tier, seemed to work better than human blood. They poured the green blood into Quinn's mouth after opening it a little by pulling the chin.

It hurt the others to see the look on Quinn's face, covered with blood all over, and just showed that they had to continue to do whatever they could to save him. The green blood quickly went into Quinn's mouth as they all waited to see if there was any reaction at all.

Yet, there was nothing other than Logan's machine that continued to beat. After that, Owen cut his hand, allowing for his own blood to be used since he was a human for Quinn to feed off.

The cut he made on his palm was quite deep because whatever the amount of blood that Quinn needed, Owen was happy to give it to him. Yet, still, there was no reaction whatsoever. A few of them even had their eyes moistened as tears streamed down their cheeks.

The cameras slowly descended, aiming to catch everything that was transpiring on the group, mainly the unsuccessful attempts of everyone to try and bring Quinn back.

Watching it on screen, Bonny couldn't help herself as her whole heart poured out.

"Are you all satisfied now!" she shouted. "You called him a monster, you called him all sorts of names but did you know, Quinn he was just..a kid..he had only just finished military training…and the weight of everything..the weight of the whole world was always on his shoulders, yet he never..never chose to give up…ARE YOU SATISFIED NOW?!" she screamed at the live stream.

The viewers who took a back seat while the whole war was going on, at the moment they all felt...guilty. Guilty for their opinion on Quinn. They recalled when he had taken over the other beast planets and how they thought he was doing it for his own gain.

Some people said the Cursed faction was good, supplying all the planets with those they needed. Still, many didn't believe them but witnessing today's events and hearing what Quinn had said to the others in his final moments, how he wanted to protect everyone, he had changed all of their minds.

"A human turned vampire…I guess he really did just care about everyone after all." A user commented.

"F in the chat to pay your respects."

"May he rest in peace. We need to remember him forever. We need to have a ceremony…it's because of him this whole war has ended."

"R.I.P. Quinn, I still can't believe it. This whole thing…it feels like a dream. Is the war really over? Did we just see the last battle against the Dalki?"

"Quinn! Take my blood, please! Bring him back!"

"He changed a lot of people; he saved us all." Void said as he tried to show Bonny the screen, but she just pushed it away.

"Does it really matter now?" Bonny replied, wiping her face. "He can't even see what they have said. He won't even be able to see the world he tried to save...and there's none of his family left. We can't even try to make up for what he has done."

"But there are the vampires, those that he really cared about." Void said. "The war might be over, but our job is not done. Remember what Quinn said in his final moments. One of his dreams was to change the world. He was able to save it, but he might never be able to see it change into a better place. We need to make sure, through our reporting, by spreading his wishes, that the whole world gets to hear his message and move on to become something better."

Sniffing up what she could, Bonny was left there still crying, but she knew Void was right.

Since nothing seemed to be working, Vincent decided to lift him off the ground.

"You weren't meant to die before me, you idiot." Vincent smiled. "Did you bring me back so that I could be the one to burry you? You gave me the hardest job of them all, do you know that?"

Looking ahead, the settlement, although the battle destroyed most of the King's castle and the perimeter walls, some places managed to remain intact. They had fortified the burial ground, so Vincent hoped it was all okay. The least they could do was bury Quinn's body.

As he started to walk, the rest followed until…

"Vincent... your chest!" Logan pointed out. "It's glowing; the nest crystal is glowing."

*****

# Chapter 1571 - How Long?

Looking down towards his chest, Vincent saw the glow through his clothing. Just seconds ago, it hadn't been like that before, so he could only assume that the change was happening because of one reason.

Seeing this, Vincent lowered Quinn, whom he held in his arms, and the glow around his chest started to fade. But then, when he lifted Quinn again, it began to get brighter. Vincent continued to do this a few times, moving him up, then down, up and down again.

"Interesting…" Vincent commented.

"Can you tell us what the hell you are doing?" Jake replied.

"It's the Nest Crystal," Logan answered, his eyes wide. "Quinn had turned into this form because he absorbed the Nest crystal. Since the Nest Crystal in your body is reacting to it, Vincent, it must mean there's a chance Quinn...is alive."

Hearing these words was the hope that everyone needed to hear. The hope that they were all looking for.

"But he's dead as well." Logan placed his finger on his chin, not entirely understanding the situation Quinn's body was in at the moment and making everyone drop their happy expression in an instant.

"Is he alive or dead? Which one is it?" Layla asked.

"Whatever the case, it seems to be drawing energy from the Crystal. Perhaps if Quinn can use this energy, then he can live." Vincent said. "We don't know what state Quinn's body is actually in. If we wait any longer, there is a good chance we might miss an opportunity. If allowing him to absorb a nest crystal will bring him back, then so be it. I have already lived a long life."

The others seemed saddened to hear this from Vincent. They hadn't known him long, but sacrificing one life for another just seemed strange, and most of all, they knew it wasn't what Quinn would have wanted.

"Calm down, Romeo. There is no need for anyone to sacrifice their lives." Logan explained. "Our best bet is to head to the settlement's lab to work out how the Crystal is working on Quinn in the first place. Remember, there is another Nest crystal in the vampire settlement."

"The clones," Jin muttered as he had figured out what Logan was talking about.

"Correct, the Nest crystal used to create the human clones. Also, the relationship between the vampires and the humans are good, and I am sure many in the Cursed faction will be willing to help out the vampires for the time being. Also, the vampires have ample blood storage anyway, so that should be enough for a while.

"There are other nest crystals out there we can use. We don't need to sacrifice anyone for Quinn."

The smile had returned to the group's faces, and each of them started to head towards the settlement. That was until they saw several small black ships falling from the sky. Some of those in the group had seen them from before.

They were Dalki combat ships, and they weren't just the small pods the Dalki would usually use. Instead, these were scouts or battleships. Each of them crashed into the ground, hardly slowing down, and then coming out from them were the Dalki themselves.

The first one they could see was a two spike Dalki.

"Who are these? I thought we destroyed all of their motherships?" Vorden frowned.

"Indeed, we did destroy all of them," Sam replied. "But there are still a few stray Dalki's out there. The only thing I can guess is they saw the broadcast, and they knew that Graham was fighting on here. Maybe, seeing what state we were in, they've come to try to finish us off."

Seeing the Dalki, there the group readied themselves for battle. For some reason, the two spiked and three spiked Dalki just didn't seem as threatening compared to what they had just been through. However, as each of them tried to gather some of their strength, they realised something.

Their bodies were extremely weak and tired. They had rested during Quinn's fight, but they only realised now that being so close to the battle, due to the pressure of everything going on from Quinn and Graham's battle, just being next to them had drained and tired them out.

"I don't know about the rest of you…but this fight might be harder than we thought," Vorden said.

Just before the Dalki could reach them, though, they saw a young blond female's figure running fast through and swinging her giant sword. It erupted into flames, having slashed the first Dalki in half.

"Erin! She's still alive." Layla was thrilled, and it looked like Erin, unlike the rest of them, had plenty of energy left to spare.

"All of you head inside the settlement!" Erin shouted. "Do whatever it is you want. Quickly."

Her hands were tense, and others perhaps would have thought it was because she was worried about the Dalki in front of her, but instead, it was something else.

The group used this chance to run forward together, but they saw that more Dalki ships were landing. A few of them were worried that Erin might not be strong enough to deal with the incoming Dalki on her own.

They even paused as they had entered the settlement and turned around.

"We will stay and fight," Jin said as he stood with the rest of the vampire leaders. "This is our home to protect, and that is our king. Besides, we have help on the way."

Looking up, they could see multiple ships returning. It was the rest of the vampires, including the royal knight Muka. They were returning not just to help but because they were coming home. Seeing this, they were more confident.

"Fex, you should go with them." Silver said. "He's your blood brother, right, and maybe they can do something, but if they can't, it will be your last chance to say goodbye."

Fex wanted to stay with his sister, but she was right, this was a crucial moment for him, and he decided to follow the rest inside. Before they headed to the lab, Layla glanced in the distance at Erin for a second.

'I feel like you should be with us as well, but I can tell… you're not coming with us for a reason, right, Erin? Is what they said... is true...that you can't control it anymore?' She thought but quickly turned around, realising she needed to focus on someone more important right now.

The group followed Vincent and Logan and eventually found themselves in the special lab - the lab where all the clones were made. The process was automatic, so even now, they could produce clones, and for most of them, it was tempting to consume some blood because of their current weakened state.

Thankfully, Vincent said they did have containers in the lab that they could eat from. At the same time, the others were recharging themselves, Logan and Vincent got to work. They placed Quinn on a special bed. There was an experimental room at the back of the main factory of the lab.

Perhaps to see if they could improve the process or something else. Still, it was perfect for them. The computer monitored Quinn's state, and the two were gathering information. And finally, they took out the Crystal from the factory and ran a few tests on Quinn to test his condition.

The others could only wait patiently for the news while the fighting continued outside, but it didn't take long for them to get an answer.

"Guys…right now, Quinn's body is incredibly weak." Vincent started to explain out loud for the others to hear. "The signs of his current state are similar to when vampires go into an eternal slumber. It's almost as if his body had decided to put him in one forcefully. Usually, a drop of blood from the same family line, even those that he had created, would work, but in this case, it doesn't seem to be the case."

"As for the Nest Crystal." Logan took over. "The good news is the energy is being transferred over to Quinn when it's next to him. It seems to have a good effect on bringing his body back to the way it was. Perhaps this might even wake him up, but there are two things we really don't know.

"One of them is how much of the nest crystal is needed for him to absorb before he can wake up. Would absorbing the whole of the nest crystal even wake him up? On top of that, perhaps his body still needs rest to recover from what has happened.

"And the second is the rate of absorption. Due to Quinn's weak body, the Crystal is absorbing at a prolonged rate. For now, Vincent has suggested that we put him in one of the Tenth family's chambers, along with the Crystal, allowing his body to absorb it."

The others were silent for a while as they processed what the two of them were telling them. After all, Vincent and Logan were the most intelligent people the group knew.

"So..are you saying Quinn will have to go into eternal slumber in those chambers...and with the nest crystal. When you say that the absorption rate is slow...how long...how long will it take for him to absorb the whole Crystal at the rate he is absorbing it now?" Sam asked.

"It's hard to say," Logan replied. "The absorption rate could improve as Quinn's condition improves. His body might start to recover even quicker; there are too many variables we can't account for, but if he is the way he is right now…ten years...yeah, it will take at least ten years to absorb the whole Crystal."

*****

# Chapter 1572 - Goodbye Quinn

Everyone couldn't quite believe it. Of course, they had heard what Logan had said about the variables in time, but that only meant that it was possible it would take longer or shorter for Quinn to come back. That was if he even came back in the first place.

"Ten years..." Layla mumbled. "We really will have to live without Quinn for ten years?"

For a second, it made everyone imagine what life would be like if Quinn was away. The countless times when he had saved them all, and from the strong enemies that were in front of them. Even today, there was nobody else who could have defeated Laxmus.

"Does he have to go into an eternal slumber? Can't we just look after him with the machines we have here?" Fex asked.

"I'm afraid that won't be possible." Vincent shook his head. "We will have to make the preparations, so Quinn officially goes into an eternal slumber. At the end of the day, Quinn is a vampire, so it would give him the best chance of not just recovering but healing his body, so he will wake up just as strong as he was when he went in there. If you want to give him the best chance of waking up, then this is what we'll have to do."

As bitter as it was, the others understood. Vincent had no reason to lie to them about something this important, and there was also Logan, who hadn't said anything to contradict what he was saying.

"A special device will be created. I have adjusted the one around Quinn's chest to allow the Nest Crystal to be placed there." Logan explained. "At the same time, it will inform me the second he wakes up again."

The others looked to be in agreement, since it was the only thing they could do. Now, they waited once again, while Logan was finishing up the details on the chest piece. In the meantime, it left the others to sit down and think.

"I won't lie to you all... I'm a little worried." Sam confessed as he looked at his hands. Whenever he felt small or insignificant, the tactician would always look at his hands for some reason. "Although Quinn saved us in the end, we lost a lot of good people. Nate's gone, Mona, Oscar, and a lot of the vampire leaders… and I'm worried what we will do without Quinn."

"I wish we could just rest, but there's still Pure back on Earth, trying to cause all kinds of trouble. I haven't heard any news from Leo about them yet. Then there's Laxmus as well. He's out there, somewhere among other vampires, and could attack humanity at any moment.

"We have to prepare for the case he will attack us while Quinn's asleep! Lastly, there's something else that Logan told me. It's about Truedream… it looks like he's alive and is out there somewhere with a clone of Jim. Even without the Dalki, there's no saying what they will do. There's a lot that can happen in that amount of time without Quinn."

All the worries that Sam currently had were shared by those surrounding him.

"Then we just have to get rid of them! He might be stronger than any one of us, but we aren't that weak without him." Sil broke the silence. "Instead of always relying on him, why don't we try to make the world a better place for when Quinn does wake up? Can you imagine how happy he would be, to find out how much the world has changed for the better?"

Of all the people to speak such sense, they had never expected it to come from Sil.

After their little talk, it looked like Logan and Vincent were ready. They started to carry Quinn over, out from the lab, and headed towards the castle. The foundations of the place were broken, but the underground tunnels had remained intact.

They continued to travel down them, and eventually reached the tenth family's burial area. Usually only Vampire Knights and leaders would be allowed to rest in such a place. Or a ceremony with the vampires would be held, allowing for them all to see, but this time, it was just those close to Quinn.

Those that had been with Quinn the longest were here with him, to send him off. Vincent activated one of the chambers which rose from the ground. The door slid open, and the others gulped, second guessing if they really needed to go through with this.

Before placing him on the container, Vincent had drawn something on the ground with blood, and laid Quinn on top of it.

"I'm starting the ritual to place Quinn in eternal sleep. There shouldn't be much change to him physically, but there will be one thing." His ancestor explained as he placed his own descendant down. There was something truly bizarre about this scene. Although he was technically older, he was inside the body of Quinn's clone, yet after his transformation the original looked older, making it look as if a son was burying his father…

The circle lit up, yet he wasn't using his equivalent exchange ability, no, those markings were more similar to what the vampires would call magic. Ancient texts left in their history allowing them to do certain things, and this was one of them.

Looking at Quinn, there really weren't any changes, however black smoke started to appear from his body, and soon, the Bone Claw started to appear in front of those gathered. The others were shocked by this, but moments later the Familiar King had completely faded.

"When a vampire goes into eternal sleep, it's similar to death. To the familiars, it feels like the same thing. It's one of the ways to actually get rid of a familiar contract. However, making a vampire go into eternal sleep and waking them up so soon isn't possible. Which is why we don't do it... and usually only the leaders are able to enjoy this special privilege, anyway."

It was then that Quinn was lifted and placed into the container. The door wasn't shut just yet, as it was time for everyone to say their final goodbyes.

"What about the Absolute Blood Control, won't people be angry that it's still with Quinn?" Fex asked.

"Angry? Do you really think anybody would blame the King after all he has done? Besides, Quinn has left us with a lot. Arthur's sword for one, and this." Vincent replied as he showed the special red blood crystal that he had left behind..

"There are many gifts that Quinn has managed to leave us, so don't worry about that."

"Do you know what happened to those in his shadow?" Sam asked. "The Demon-tier Dragon, Minny and Sunny. His equipment, they were all still in there, right?"

"I'm not a user of the Shadow ability myself." Vincent replied. "But if I were to take a guess, they are currently trapped along with Quinn. Until he wakes up, there isn't much we can do. However, remember that the shadow itself has the ability to slow down time. Maybe for them, it won't feel as long." Vicnent didn't say the other half, the possibility that it could feel like a lot longer to them. The only good thing was, it possibly meant that the Demon-tier dragon had been sealed away with Quinn.

One by one, the group placed their hands on Quinn, in the container, wishing to say their goodbyes. They all said personal things, while reminiscing about the good times that they had shared together. Nevertheless, each one of them made it clear that they would see him again.

Finally, it was Layla's turn. She seemed to take the longest out of everyone, but nobody faulted her for that. All of them had been aware how she personally had felt towards Quinn. In a way, these ten years would be the most torturous for her. As the tears fell down her face, the others began to choke up a bit as well.

They had been through a lot, lost countless people, and this moment served as a reminder to all of them that even the mightiest being could fall.

The last one to say his goodbyes, out of all of them, though, was Peter, and after speaking a few things he turned around.

"I wish to stay here with Quinn." Peter announced. Although his face showed only a sliver of emotion, all of them felt the loyalty in his voice. "I know... I know that he is just going to be sleeping, and he probably won't know that I'm here with him, but as long as my first friend stays here, I want to protect him.

"I intend to make sure that nobody disturbs his rest. As a Wight I never need to sleep, so I will be awake the whole time, and I will make sure that Quinn is protected until he wakes up."

A lot of them wanted to tell Peter that there was no need, that Quinn would be safe here. However, from the look in Peter's eyes, they could tell he had already made up his mind. Besides, some of them thought he might get bored and decide to come out after a few days anyway.

All of them stood there surrounded, watching the special tomb activate. The glass screen covered them, while the container started to spiral into the ground. Eventually closing and locking in place.

"Enjoy your sleep, Quinn. Look forward to what we'll have to show you once you wake up again." Vorden smiled.

End of Volume 6

*****

# Chapter 1573 - The Return Of A Legend

There was an endless black space in front of him, filled with complete darkness and nothing else. It felt like one was asleep yet, at the same time, not. There were no dreams, no sounds, no noises, nothing. And, all they could see was an endless black space.

Since no thoughts could transpire, one couldn't even feel the passage of time. Meaning even the person themselves had no clue what had happened or what their body was currently doing. This was the current feeling or non-existent feeling they were going through. For how long had it been like this, there was no sense at all. And after an unknown amount of time, they finally heard a voice.

'You…..you…'

He heard it, but whose voice was it? At the moment, he couldn't even access his own memories in his current state.

'You..you need to…'

'Yeah...I need to do what? Make breakfast? Get ready for school? Do homework? What are you trying to tell me?'

'You need to wake up!' The voice yelled, resounding in his head.

'Quinn, wake up!' The voice shouted once more.

'Quinn?' Hearing his own name, something summoned inside of him, suddenly the darkness he was surrounded in began to diminish and disappear. In return, a bright white light started to shine in his mind, and with it, images flashed through Quinn.

'Everything…is coming back to me.' Quinn felt.

All of the flashing images were everything that Quinn had gone through so far, and the memories were returning to him with every detail. Memories from when he was a child, memories of when a certain individual had knocked at Quinn's door, declaring that his parents had died.

The memories flooded his head. They were all coming back to him: how his life had changed, how it had started when he first had arrived at military school—turning into a vampire from that book, meeting Vorden, meeting Fex, another vampire for the first time.

The school tournament, Fex being abducted, saving Fex, returning to the world during the civil war, the multiple fights he fought, allies he made along the way, and the allies Quinn lost as well, saving Vorden from Blade island and barely pulling him back from death's door.

Not just once, but multiple times. Founding what is now known as the Cursed faction, becoming part of the big four. Then, saving the vampire settlement from the new king Cindy, losing close allies to him once more.

The start of the Dalki attack, becoming the Vampire King and finally fighting against Graham.

Having completed the quest and become something beyond a vampire, he had managed to defeat Graham.

'I did a lot; I did a lot during that time.' Quinn thought. 'I guess I'm dead now; I guess I can finally rest.'

'Oi, you idiot! Didn't you hear me? You have to wake up!' the voice screamed in his head once more. It jolted Quinn awake as his eyes opened, and the first thing he could see was a steamy glass in front of him.

Huffing and panting, Quinn could feel his heart race, something that hadn't happened in a long time. Ever since he became a vampire, his heartbeat was usually slow, and now, all of his body was starting to move slowly. The tingly feeling as blood began to rush through his veins, and in the end, was the familiar screen that flashed in front of him.

[System is rebooting]

[Congratulations, you have been granted the Celestial Vampire System]

'Celestial vampire system?' Quinn read, wondering what that even meant, he could guess based on his evolution that the two were linked, but it wasn't exactly clear yet. Still, seeing the system message like so was reminiscent of the first time when Quinn had become a vampire.

The only difference was, last time, he passed out before he could hear the whole message.

[Your System has successfully been upgraded to suit the current user]

[Error: The user's body is not yet fully functional]

[Syncing will begin as the User's body improves]

[Current Sync Status: 1 Percent]

Quinn had been with the System a long time to understand the meaning behind the messages in front of him. Judging by what he could remember, he could only imagine that his body had gone into a slumbering state. Even now, Quinn could feel that his body was quite weak.

However, as the blood flowed through his body, it was slowly getting back to its normal state, and not just him being a vampire, but his celestial vampire form. He could feel that his strength hadn't degraded in any way if the system's number was anything to go by.

Just like vampire lords and the evolution before this one, it was a permanent change. He just needed his body to wake up, and then the System would sync up his body and powers allowing him to use his strength at his will.

'I just hope that it doesn't take as long for me to get back to normal as it did for me to absorb that damned nest crystal.'

Eventually, upon sensing that the figure was alive in the container, the glass door slid open, allowing Quinn to see a different view for the first time.

The first thing Quinn saw was a large glass plain window revealing the bright blue sky. The white clouds, and on the ground were the countless buildings all over the place, ornamented with giant advertisement billboards.

"Is this…earth?" Quinn wondered. As he took a step, his body was certainly weaker than he thought it was, but still, at 1 percent of his actual strength, he was stronger than he ever was as a human; thus, it wasn't a problem for him to walk around.

Looking behind him, Quinn recognised the strange container device. It was one of the special burial tombs designed for the leaders to rest in peace.

"Was I in some eternal sleep then? Is that what happened?" Quinn said. "But then, why am I in a random apartment building and back on earth, not the vampire settlement?"

"AHHH!" A voice suddenly screamed from the side; turning his head immediately, Quinn saw a familiar face. "...Peter?"

"Quinn...you finally came out of that thing…what the hell! But you were asleep; it's really you!" Peter couldn't help but shout.

Peter couldn't stop staring at Quinn up and down, which was weird for the latter because, for Quinn, it felt like hardly any time at all had passed when fighting against Graham. Based on Peter's reaction, who was constantly pinching different parts of his own body to check if he was in a dream or not, it seemed like Quinn had been in a slumber for a long time.

Quinn also noticed that his own body had still changed quite a bit. For one, the red vein-like markings were still spread along his chest and arms. There was a very, very faint glow in them, but it was enough proof that his body was different from others.

His hair was still long, and they went down till his waist. On the other hand, Peter looked the same as Quinn could remember him - pale skin, bald-headed, undead subclass.

For now, Quinn couldn't access his system, and it looked like, while the system was being synced with his body, he wouldn't be able to use it. He was hoping to find some information from that, but now, the only person he could rely on was Peter.

"So tell me, Peter...what happened to me?" Quinn finally asked.

Peter went on to explain the moments after Quinn had defeated Graham. They had gone through what they had gone through and the decision that was made to put him into eternal sleep, as well as the nest crystal used.

"I see, but I guess the chest piece that Logan made." Quinn took it off, as it was clear it was no longer working and threw it on the floor, revealing his bare chest. "It's broken, so they won't know that I've woken up. Anyway, I understand why they put me into eternal sleep, but why are we here in this apartment?

"And are we on earth? What happened to the vampire settlement and all the others, and how long was I in there for? You said that it could take ten years or maybe longer. Have ten years passed?"

After asking all those questions, Quinn waited to hear which one Peter would answer first, but all he had gotten back was a shrug.

"I don't know... I've been here with you the whole time. I don't even know where we are right now." Peter replied.

Hearing this, Quinn raised an eyebrow. Just how was that even possible?

*****

# Chapter 1574 - A Strange Trio

Ever since Peter had evolved, speaking to him compared to before certainly was a head-scratcher. His personality had changed, but it looked like becoming an undead also led to losing a few brain cells here and there.

"Peter, you have to explain to me... how do you not know anything that happened? You said so yourself that I was buried underneath the Tenth's Family castle. I mean, is this the tenth's castle?"

Peter gave him a look suggesting that he really wasn't that stupid; of course, he knew this wasn't the Tenth's Family castle.

"Quinn, when I make a promise, I really mean it." Peter started off. "When I said I was going to stay by your tomb and make sure no one took it or did anything to you while you were asleep, I really meant it. So I stayed by your side.

"At some point, something strange happened while we were there. Suddenly, you and I were teleported or something, and now we are here in this apartment. That's all I know; the rest of the story is as much as you know."

Thinking about it, Quinn knew that the whole settlement could be teleported to a different location; that was how he had moved it to the new location of the vampire settlement. However, could someone really just teleport the two of them without Peter's knowledge?

"So, how long ago did this happen? How long were you at the vampire settlement? And how long have you been in this place?" Quinn asked.

Once again, though, Peter just shrugged his shoulders.

"You mean you have no idea? A year, a day, two days... you had nothing else to do. You could have at least counted the days as they went past by drawing a line in the room or something indicating one day after every sunset." Quinn sighed.

"We don't even know its earth, if the sun goes up or down, it could be longer than that on earth, and I told you already, I stood here protecting you. Quinn, what's so hard to understand about what I'm saying?" Peter replied.

"So you didn't go outside or attempt to open that door right there?" Quinn pointed down the hallway towards a door. "To see where we were, what year it is, or find out anything about the outside world."

As Peter shook his head after hearing Quinn's words, it was clear that he didn't leave his position. In a way, Quinn was quite amazed at his commitment. It certainly wasn't something he would have been able to do, or he would have gone mad.

Since talking to Peter wasn't getting him anywhere, there was one other that was currently with Quinn that he could speak to, the one that had woken him up.

'Ray, you're there, right? You heard everything I asked. Can you make any sense of this? Were you conscious while I was asleep?' Quinn asked.

Before fighting Graham but right after getting the nest crystal and upgrading his system, he remembered that Ray had awoken from whatever slumber he was in.

'I'm not sure too much..however, I have to tell you something. I'm currently not in the system.' Ray replied

'Not in the system? Wait, how is that possible? How are you able to speak right now?' Quinn asked.

'I don't even understand my current state, much less the understanding of crystals or the powers they hold. I just know that I am strong, and that's it.' Ray replied. 'But if you want an answer, I'll give you one. One that I think fits. I believe that the power of the first nest crystal had brought me back, my consciousness back, that is.

'However, the second nest crystal that you absorbed. You only needed a small part of its energy, and it allowed me to use the rest of it. And when the crystal was fully absorbed, I found myself in what I believed to be your shadow space. Don't ask me how your shadow powers work or why this happened.

'But remember, the power of the shadow is quite special. Its origins are nearly as mysterious as the origins of all the abilities that humans know of to this day.'

Honestly, Quinn couldn't wrap his head around it either, but Ray was in his shadow space. Didn't that mean he was currently alive? Did he have a physical body in there?

'No, I do not; just my consciousness moved there, although I did have a small portion of my power. Similar to how I let you access it through the system, and I have used it to make a nice little home in your dragon pet you have with you.' Ray replied.

'Dragon..pet?'

It was then that Quinn realised that Ray was referring to the Demon tier beast that Quinn had placed in his shadow. If what Ray was saying was true, now Ray's consciousness was inside the demon tier pet.

'Oh no…' Quinn thought as he realised something else.

"Sunny and that little girl! They were both in the shadows with me, and I never released them when you guys put me into eternal sleep." Quinn said out loud he was so surprised.

Immediately, figuring this out, Quinn placed his hand out and used his shadow lock skill to release them. Although his body wasn't what it used to be, perhaps his blood powers were still getting better. The shadow powers he had learnt to use, he could use them all just fine.

"Wahhh." A girl's voice was immediately heard, crying her eyes out. She was around the age of six or seven, it was hard for Quinn to tell, but he did know one thing, the girl looked the same age as when he put her in the shadow space.

'Does even shadow lock stop things, or does time just move slower there, like when I trap attacks in my ability?' Quinn thought but now was not the time to worry because although Minny was moving, it didn't look like Sunny, who was by her side, was.

Kneeling, Quinn observed the latter. She was battered and looked just as bad as when Graham had her in her hands. Quinn waited for Minny to calm down so he could get some answers from her because there was one other change.

It was the fact that she no longer smelt like a human, but instead, she smelt like a vampire now. After eventually calming down, Minny opened her mouth to speak.

She spoke about how Sunny was still alive but incredibly weak when Quinn pulled them into the shadow space. Graham had hurt her beyond the point where she could naturally heal. Currently, she had drunk some of Minny's blood, but it was useless.

The wounds inflicted on her body were from Graham's werewolf form; thus, she couldn't heal them on her own. Since they were in space and didn't know how long they would be there, Sunny decided to do something. It was a gamble, but she thought it was the best chance of the girl's survival.

So, in the end, Sunny ended up turning Minny. Vampires didn't need blood to live; they just went crazy without it, turning into bloodsuckers. Still, Sunny believed those on the outside would work it out, but eventually, she ended up dying, leaving Minny on her own.

However, a short while later, she had made a friend, claiming that she met with the dragon and played with it a few times. The two had managed to keep each other company.

'From what Ray just told me, he must have been using the dragon body to look after Minny...I'm glad things worked out. If Ray had never regained consciousness and taken over the dragon, Minny would have most likely died.' Quinn thought.

Now, Quinn had a better understanding of what happened, but still, he knew nothing about the current world. Thus, all that was left to do was head outside. Quinn used his shadow equip and placed some clothes on his body. He realised that both of the blood sets were no longer present; at the same time, his blood gauntlet also had disappeared.

This most likely happened when Quinn transformed and decided on his final attack. Everything made out of blood on his body had disappeared, and same for the armour that was in his shadow.

Still, he had the rest of his beast gear, his demon tier gauntlet and his blue fang set. He didn't equip his blue fang set because when heading outside, for now, Quinn didn't want any attention until he knew precisely what was going on and got information about the state of the world.

Who knew, maybe Travellers, among other things, didn't exist anymore. So he just wore some normal clothing he had stored away.

"Is that Arthur's power?" Minny asked.

"Arthur? Ah…yes, aren't you that girl, the one that Arthur looked after?"

It was then that Minny started to cry once more as she welled up.

"He..he joined them..because of me…they kept me, and used me against them…and..and."

"It's not your fault," Quinn said as he rubbed her head. "The Dalki were coming after us no matter what, and Arthur...he saved my life. I liked him a lot as well. Arthur must have adored you, huh?"

For some reason, Quinn felt like he owed Arthur a lot, even after he had put him through everything, but the girl in front of him, she was innocent, but at least he could do one thing.

"Hey Minny, you told me you want to find your mother, right? Well, let's go and look for her together. I promise that I'll protect you until we find your mother. You can trust me. I'm a friend of Arthur; that's also why we have the same power." Quinn explained.

Minny still looked scared but decided to nod and follow him.

Before leaving, Quinn placed Sunny back in his shadow space for now and would give her a proper burial when things settled down, but now it was time to head out the door and see what the new world had in store for them.

'Layla, Sam, Vorden, Logan, are all you guys still alive?'

*****

# Chapter 1575 - Big Changes

Before leaving the apartment, Quinn decided to inspect the whole place. All three of them looked around to see if they could gather any clues. For one, someone had to own the apartment in the first place.

Peter had stated that not a single person had visited the apartment during his time here, which meant that someone had purposely teleported them to this place and had prepared the room for them as well. On top of that, not one person had visited them during Peter's time in the tomb.

Either they were moved fairly quickly which didn't make any sense or something happened that had stopped them from visiting.

Whoever organised all of this, Quinn hoped that they would have left something, a reason, maybe an update of what was going on outside, but other than the container that Quinn was slumbering in, it looked like there was nothing else worth noting in the room.

"I guess I should put away the tomb as well; although it's a bit strange carrying my own tomb around, we don't want anyone finding it and asking questions," Quinn said as he placed it inside his dimensional space.

Quinn wasn't done there yet, though. He looked out the window at the people below. It was hard to imagine they were in a shelter because no matter how far he looked, he couldn't see the edge of the Shelter walls like he used to be able to.

What this looked like, was what used to be described to them, taught to them as children, cities of the old that didn't have any walls.

"Peter, it's best if you disguise your face for now, and do you mind changing mine as well?" Quinn asked.

"Huh, you really are a cautious person, aren't you? Is there any reason we should hide?" Peter asked.

"Well, everyone in the world once knew our faces, right? We don't know what could have happened while we were away, how much has changed. Maybe I am thinking too much, but it's better to be safe than sorry." Quinn explained.

"But does it matter? I mean, Quinn, even if a hundred years passed, there isn't going to be anyone stronger than you, I think, not even in a million years. I thought that your body might have reverted back after your fight with Graham, but you're the same, and my connection to you hasn't reconnected either." Peter replied.

Talking about connection, Peter referred to that of the Wight and creator. Now that Quinn thought about it, he couldn't feel a connection with anyone like he usually would, from Peter, who stood next to him, or from any of the vampires he had made.

'I would have been worried that they might be dead, but Peter is right next to me, and I can't feel him...is it something to do with my body?' Quinn wondered. 'Maybe because I'm…not really a vampire anymore..so many things have changed with my body. I don't even feel like I know myself anymore.'

While thinking this, Quinn looked at the system screen, stating that his body was still at one percent syncing.

'Maybe a few days.'

Quinn then moved his hand and put it out in front of Peter, as if he was going for a handshake.

"Take it." He added.

Peter followed Quinn's words and grabbed the hand, and suddenly, he could feel that Quinn was attempting to squeeze his hand, but that's when he realised it wasn't hurting him at all, and the pressure was minimal. Not that Peter could feel pain, but he could still feel the pressure.

"I can tell by the look on your face, you know now." Quinn smiled. "I just tried grabbing your hand as hard as I could. Don't worry, I'll be back to normal, and honestly, I can always use the best gear and activate that in an emergency. Even without my strength at its fullest, with the beast gear, there won't be any problem, but just in case, Peter, it looks like I'll be relying on you to protect me for a bit."

In the end, Peter listened to Quinn and changed his face to one of the many Cursed faction members he had seen before. He then handed the mask over to Quinn and turned him into a person that hardly ever stood out: Chucky, from the Cursed faction.

"What about me!" Minny asked, excited to get a new look.

"You won't need one; you're cute enough as it is," Quinn said, but he could see that his answer didn't satisfy her, making her a little glum. She pouted clearly upset. Not having any siblings before, or any kids of his own, he didn't know the best way to deal with the young girl. On top of that, there was a chance that Minny could be with them for a while.

"Ah I know!" Quinn said excitedly thinking of something.

Quinn decided to enter his shadow space and pulled out one of his masks he had kept on him.

In his hand, it was the red Oni demon mask, which was currently at the Demi-god tier level after being upgraded with the upgrade crystal. He had already attempted to use the cominucater that was built inside of it to see if there was any answer but there was no such luck.

Quinn felt like it was strange having such a mask on a little girl, especially since it seemed to be a bit too boyish and a little frightening, but as soon as Minny got her hands on it, she was over the moon and immediately placed it on her face.

"It actually kinda suits you, in a scary way," Peter said, as Minny ran around pretending to be a monster making growls with her hands up by her head.

'That mask might even help her protect herself a little bit.' Quinn thought. Still, there was always the shadow space if he wanted to protect her, but with her being in the shadow space for so long already he felt guilty if he was to put her inside it again.

Before opening the door to the outside world, Quinn's hand hesitated just before it touched the door knob.

"What's wrong?" Peter asked.

"I'm just worried about what we might find out...I'm a little scared. I fought so hard to defeat the Dalki to change the world, and now that we have finally defeated the Dalki, is the world still as bad as it was before?" Quinn asked.

"What are you scared of, clearly you can see it's better. Quinn, all those people can walk outside because of you. Whether a thousand years have passed and everyone's forgotten everything, does it matter? Come on." Peter said, nudging him to the side and opening the door for him.

In front of them, there was just a hallway, and Peter soon walked ahead.

"You know, I wouldn't be so worried if someone had just left the apartment like that to just take a peek at what had happened," Quinn replied.

The three of them walked down the hallway, wondering if they would see anyone, but they hadn't and, then going down the stairs, they finally reached the reception area. Quinn looked to see if there would be a worker, but instead, there was just a floating robot.

As they reached the exit, the door opened, and finally, they were on the normal streets of the world—flying spaceships above moving about in an orderly fashion, robotic and automated machinery everywhere, but what else was noticeable was that many were wearing beast gear.

Even walking around the city, these people had their weapons on them. The weapons were sheathed or put away, but it reminded Quinn of what the developed Shelters would look like, mainly the A-tier or above Shelters.

Taking a deep breath, Quinn stood in front of a random person on the street, a middle-aged man.

"Sorry, sir, do you know where we currently are, what planet we are on?" Quinn asked.

"What planet are we on? What planet are you on, you weirdo? Who doesn't know what planet they are on." The man ignored him and walked straight past.

Seeing the next person, Quinn tried to talk to him, but most people wouldn't give him the time of day.

"Sorry, do you know what year we are in?" Quinn asked.

"What year? Are you shooting a time-travelling movie or something?" A woman replied without halting her steps for even a second as she continued to move her way.

"Arghh this is so frustrating!" Peter shouted. "Just use your influence skill on them or something and get an answer.

"I…I can't. Something weird is going on." Quinn said as he looked at his hand. He had sensed something when he was stepping towards the woman he talked to just a moment ago. Closing his eyes, Quinn started to focus.

"What do you mean you can't? It's just one or two, so why don't you use it?"

Opening his eyes, Quinn was thankful that his body could still do this much, but without his body being at his previous level, he wouldn't be able to do it for long nor sense those that were too far from him. The good thing was, his powers were better than before, and there was no need to touch them.

"All of these humans, they have the power of Qi," Quinn answered. "Either we're on a planet full of Pure members, or something serious happened while I was asleep."

*****

# Chapter 1576 - One Of Us

Since everyone was treating Quinn weirdly anyway, he decided to make sure what he was sensing was right. Unlike Leo and Erin he didn't have an ability that would outright allow him to see things. With the next person that went by, he quickly grabbed onto their hands and tried to focus, seeing the Qi inside their body.

He had picked a stranger because he wanted to see if it was just one of the many. Unfortunately for Quinn, he had grabbed the hands of a girl.

"What are you doing, you pervert?" She shouted as she went to hit him with an open palm, but Quinn quickly stepped back and avoided the strike quite easily. Even if his strength wasn't fully recovered, he wouldn't get hit by something like that.

"Sorry, I thought you were someone else; please forgive me." Quinn smiled, and the girl gave her a look and was quickly on her way.

In that brief interaction, he had confirmed his thoughts. It wasn't just that all the human's had Qi. On top of that, they had learnt up to the second stage, and this way, they were able to use Qi in their brain area. No matter how strong Quinn's influence skill was, it couldn't bypass the Qi accumulated around the brain.

'There's only one reason why they would do something like this.' Quinn thought. 'It has to be to avoid vampires using the influence skill on them.'

"Well, I mean, what do we do now? No one wants to talk to us; we can't force them. I guess we could beat them up or keep asking until we know." Peter suggested.

"No, don't beat up strangers!" Minny shouted at Peter, telling him off.

"Well, just knowing what the date is or what planet we are on won't change much," Quinn replied. "It's more important to find out what happened during the time we were away and to see if we can find anyone."

They strolled around the streets to see if they could see any information, but there just seemed to be ads of different companies everywhere, from luxury clothes to holiday adverts.

The atmosphere was quite peaceful and there certainly didn't seem to be the threat of a war, which was a nice change for once.

Eventually, heading into a shop, Quinn finally saw the day's date; however, the date itself made no sense to him at all.

"Did they change the system again?" Quinn said as he awkwardly looked at the date, and the other two did, scratching their heads.

"Did we travel into the past?" Peter asked.

"Thats imposible, stupid!" Minny said.

Although what Peter said was highly unlikely, he could see why he had come to that conclusion. The year they were in was around 2670. Yet, the date currently says they were in 1016. Either the planet they were on wasn't following conventional means, or it was something else.

Walking out of the shop, they were now stumped at what to do. They had long realised that their money cards had expired and weren't accepted. So they couldn't buy anything, much less get a ship, which they would need eventually, but getting anywhere would be difficult without money.

'Right now, I really wish I had Logan by my side as well.' Quinn thought. The little inventor was sure to figure out things quickly for them.

"Maybe we should just head to a library or something; there should be information there about what happened, and it's better than asking people anyway." Quinn sighed.

However, a whiff had caught his nose; it was a very familiar scent. He turned his head and opened his eyes wide for a moment before suddenly he began to run through the crowd of people.

"Quinn, what is it?" Peter asked.

"It's a… it's one of us." Quinn answered, not wanting to say the word out loud. "They smell exactly like us."

This was a big enough hint for Peter to figure out what Quinn was talking about. The ones that smelt different from humans, it was a vampire, Quinn could smell a vampire.

He continued to follow the scent, but with so many people on the streets, it was hard for him to pinpoint who it was, but finally, as the area cleared a little, Quinn had arrived just outside a large square shaped building.

It looked like a giant cube and was solid black in colour. The colour itself reminded Quinn of the material used by the vampires and Dalki in the past. The strange thing about the area was the fact that it was plotted in the middle of an open square.

The other skyscrapers and more were spread out away from it. Here there was an open space, and it was full of what Quinn suspected were: Travellers. They were talking, swinging their swords and were busy in their day.

"That girl! The one by the door!" Quinn said as the doors slid open to let the girl in, and she went inside.

The three quickly followed.

'If it's a vampire, we can ask what happened to the other leaders and the rest of them, if they're one walking among them, they should know something, I mean I was their king…they should at least remember me, have put me down in their history books or something, right?' Quinn thought.

When they entered the strange building, they noticed that there were even more Travellers inside than outside. They had gathered in groups and were busy talking. It was a large open hall without much else, and there was a reception straight ahead. This time, unlike the apartment, rather than a robot serving people, there was an actual human behind the desk, and the woman that Quinn had sensed earlier was at the reception.

Quinn caught a glance of her appearance from the side, wondering if it was a vampire he noticed. She looked around 5 foot 10 and had long shiny black hair and a normal figure; there was nothing strange about her; in fact, she blended in the scene pretty well.

This made it difficult for Quinn to recognise her; what he had just described in his head was what most vampires at the settlement looked like. At the same time, it wasn't like Quinn had talked to every vampire in the settlement.

Still, there was one thing he noticed, and it was her eye colour; from where he was, he found out that she had hazel eyes.

Walking around and stepping closer, Quinn pretended he was talking with Peter while eavesdropping on her conversation with the receptionist.

"I'm sorry, Miss Clark, but we have told you multiple times that you are unable to take the exam on your own. You must proceed with a group of five." The receptionist spoke in a polite tone.

"That makes zero sense. You measure our individual abilities, but do we need to do it as a group? I could take the test myself, so why are the requirements so strict? Is this just to stop us from becoming Travellers? You know very well it will be hard to find anyone to team up with me!" The vampire shouted back.

"I'm sorry, but the rules are made for a reason, and I can't change them. If you are a vampire, then you can always go through the support program, where we will put you in an anonymous group to take the test. We know it's hard for vampires these days to form a group." The receptionist replied.

"But I don't want a group! If you put me in a random group, they will just slow me down, or worse, they will purposely try to obstruct me from getting a good rank!" In the end, it looked like the vampire knew there was no point in her arguing anymore and walked away.

'That was interesting.' Quinn thought.

From the conversation they had, the receptionist was aware of the fact that the girl was a vampire. On top of that, the former didn't seem to be scared of the fact even though she was human. The world knew of the V, but a vampire travelling on their own like so was unheard of. Learning of this only made Quinn more interested in what happened to the world.

On top of that, he had figured out that what they were in seemed to be similar to a Travellers centre, where Travellers would give a test to apply for or to upgrade their ranks.

Getting closer and moving away, Quinn didn't want to lose sight of her, but he thought that perhaps there would be more and was wondering how to approach her and what to say. Then suddenly, after a few sniffs, she had turned around.

She had stopped and stared straight at Quinn with a frown on her eyebrow. Now that Quinn had a good look at her, he realised that her both eyes weren't hazel; instead, only one of them was. The other eye was blue. It was the first time he had ever seen such a thing before.

"You…why are you following me? Are you with them?" The female vampire asked. "If you are, then consider this a warning. You will be in big trouble if you try anything funny."

The others in the room turned their heads and looked towards Quinn and the others. The problem was Quinn had no idea what was going on or how to answer the question without turning this into a fight.

*****

# Chapter 1577 - Whats Your Name?

Knowing how much time had passed couldn't be necessary, at least he could put that off, for now. These were some of the thoughts that went through Quinn's head, but being put in the current situation, he started to think, perhaps it was important.

Many things could have been lost in history and changed depending on how much time had passed. For one, it was evident that the vampire in front of him knew that he was also a vampire since they both caught each other's scent.

However, Quinn didn't really know what he smelled like; the different ranks of vampires would smell slightly different and honestly, it was harder for the lower ranks to distinguish between these smells. To top it off, he would assume that he was the first of his kind, the first ever Cleisital vampire. Perhaps he smelt like a subclass or a lowly vampire to the person in front of him which was why she was comfortable speaking to him in this way. Regardless, it was clear that even though she knew he was a vampire, she didn't recognise him; perhaps there was some tension going on among the vampires.

After all, there was a good chance that over a thousand years had passed based on the dates he had seen, but based on the technology that Quinn had noticed around him, it didn't seem too advanced for that amount of time. Things weren't adding up.

'Is it between the families, a new group of vampires? Or maybe during the time I was away, Laxmus could have been creating his own group of vampires?' Quinn quickly thought.

In the end, he had to just go for it.

"I belong to the Thirteenth Family," Quinn answered.

Why did Quinn pick the Thirteenth family? Because the Tenth family, which was the family that Quinn belonged to, was their King at some point. However, the Tenth Family always seemed to have…problems. Once again, there was a good chance that something new must have cropped up as well.

'Fex was still alive back then, and he was a Royal knight, so I doubt that the Thirteenth family would have problems.'

After answering, the vampire looked Quinn up and down. Her aggressive nature seemed to lessen after hearing the answer. However, it seemed like it was all a facade as she quickly lifted her hand as if she was trying to hit Quinn right in the face.

'Damn it, her punch is a lot faster than that human…one percent of my strength just isn't going to cut it!' Quinn thought as he leaned his upper body back but could see the fist would still hit him.

Before it did, though, Peter quickly snapped his hand and firmly grabbed the vampire's wrist.

"What the f*ck do you think you're doing?!" Peter shouted as he tightened his grip around the wrist.

It was clear that it was somewhat hurting the vampire.

"Peter, relax; I think she was just trying to test us," Quinn replied.

As the former let go of the wrist, the vampire looked annoyed because everyone in the room had stopped to watch the little spat that was going on.

"What are you looking at? There's no fight; mind your own business!" The vampire shouted towards them.

The others soon scattered and returned to their work while the angry female vampire stormed off and sat down on the sofa arranged off to the side. Quinn looked at Peter and the little girl. Since she hadn't run off or said anything else, Quinn must have given her a satisfactory answer.

Either way, Quinn was sure that he could get some of his answers from her. So he decided to follow her, with the others.

"Mister, that girl scares me," Minny said, pulling the corner of Quinn's shirt.

"It's okay; I don't think she's a bad person," Quinn said as he held Minny's hand, and the three of them came over and sat down on the seat opposite her. The vampire stared at them and folded her arms.

"So are you going to say why you have been following me this whole time? Or are you going to just sit there and stare at me?" the vampire asked.

"It's a little difficult for me to explain." Quinn nervously smiled. "You see, our memories have been wiped. We don't know if it was an ability or something else, but when we regained our consciousness, we were here, and we know nothing of this place."

It was the best explanation Quinn could come up with, which would allow him to ask so many questions.

"Then how did you know you were in the Thirteenth family?" She asked.

"There are parts that we remember here and there; our memory isn't completely gone," Quinn answered. "But things like what planet we are on, how much time has passed, what happened to the other families and so on... it's all a little jumbled in our heads."

The vampire unfolded her arms and continued to look at Quinn carefully. It made Quinn worried, wondering if she had recognised him or perhaps Peter.

"If someone wiped your memory, it was probably done by a superior vampire. They probably gave you a mission, or you did something bad to have your memories wiped." The vampire then glanced at the kid. "Or it could even be that the three of you saw something that someone didn't want you to see. Maybe it was easier than killing you since you have that strong Wight with you.

"Either way, I understand your situation a little bit now. You sensed another vampire, which was me, and came to me looking for answers." She sighed.

Thankfully, it looked like the vampire had bought Quinn's little lie and was now being a little understanding.

"I'm afraid I can't help you out much. I'm not part of the same group of vampires as you, so I have no idea why you are here. I used to be part of the Vampire corps, so I have little connection to the family vampires."

Now Quinn was perplexed; Vampire corps, family vampires? Was there a difference between the two? Were there now different groups of vampires like Quinn thought.

"I'm sorry, vampire Corps, what are they?" Quinn asked.

He was a little worried that this question would have made it too obvious that he knew nothing of this current world, but what else could he do? He really didn't know anything.

"Wow, how much of your memories did they remove for you to not know about the Vampire corps? It's like you've been living under a rock." She replied. "If that's the case, then you really must have a lot of questions."

She looked at Peter and then glanced towards the front desk, at the receptionist from before.

"So I have information that you want, right? Honestly, you will probably want me to help you find someone after I tell you everything as well." She scratched her head like it would be a pain. "Look, I'll be happy to answer your questions, but how about you do a favour for me first?"

Honestly, Quinn thought it was quite fair since she would be helping them out, and he didn't think he would find someone that would have as much information about the whole situation as another vampire.

"As long as it is something I'm able to do, I think it's fair," Quinn replied.

"My name is Jessica Clark, ex-member of the Vampire corps. I know that means nothing to you, but I'm at the vampire Noble level, so that should at least tell you my strength if you remember that much." Jessica explained. "Right now, I need a job, and the only thing I'm good at is fighting, so I've decided to become a Traveller. I'm sure you overheard our conversation, right?

"To take the test, I need a team of five. I'm strong enough to do things myself; I just need you guys to enrol for the test with me. But it looks like your friend there is quite strong, so if he wishes to help out as well, it wouldn't be bad either. You understand what I'm asking?"

"I do," Quinn replied. "But with us, if we include Minny, that means we have four people. I'm not even sure Minny can take the test."

"She's a vampire as well, right? They don't have an age restriction for vampires, so that's fine, and I promise I won't let your daughter get hurt," Jessica said.

Looking at Jessica, he wanted to correct her; Minny certainly wasn't his daughter. However, the person in question glanced at Quinn with her mask, her eyes just showed smiles like she didn't mind.

"It's okay, dad!" Minny giggled after.

'What the…' Quinn was at a loss for words.

"This is part of the favour; we need one more person to join us. With us being vampires, it might be a bit hard. I've asked around a bit but can't find anyone, so hopefully, your luck is a little better than mine. Maybe use that pretty face of yours to woo some girls over." Jessica suggested.

Thinking about it, Quinn thought maybe it was a chance for him to find out what Jessica was talking about, why humans currently disliked vampires yet were in the same society.

"It's a deal." Quinn agreed.

"Great, I'll be waiting here until you find our Fifth member, and by the way. Maybe I can help you get in contact with your family; what's your name?" Jessica asked.

Thinking about it, Quinn didn't want to use his real name. Not until he knew the situation, but perhaps a name would be a way to make others aware that he was looking for them. When picking the name, Quinn was a little happy but melancholy at the same time.

"My name…is Nate, Nate Snell," He replied.

# Chapter 1578 - A Memento

One of the reasons why Quinn agreed to the request rather than arguing with Jessica in the first place was because he believed that it was quite an easy task. The fact that she was sitting in her seat patiently meant she was somewhat expecting him to complete it, and what better place to look for a partner than the Travellers centre they were in right now.

'There has to be someone in here who is in the same situation as Jessica. Looking to form a team here.' As Quinn listened, he could hear that many were having conversations about taking the test together or looking for partners.

They asked each other about their abilities, what weapons they used and so on. Many in the room seemed to be taking the test for the first time to become a traveller and were a bit nervous, and this made Quinn understand why Jessica was quite confident.

Since many of these in the room had never taken the test before, as a vampire Nobel taking the test for the first time, she should be above most of those in the room.

"Why don't you two wait here," Quinn said, thinking that perhaps Peter wouldn't be the best person to come along. When walking off, Jessica couldn't help but take a peek, wondering just how Quinn would do.

"You know, when your friend accepted easily, I thought he might have had a plan, but I guess not," Jessica commented.

It wasn't the hardest thing to talk to people for Quinn, so he decided to approach others that seemed like they were also looking for members.

"Hey guys, I heard you're looking for a team; we only need one more per-" before Quinn could finish his words, the others looked at Quinn and started to walk away.

Immediately, the reaction from the people annoyed him somewhat. It had been a long time since he was treated in such a way. Thinking that perhaps he might have just come across a rude group of people, Quinn approached another group, but once again had the same reaction as the other as he turned away and started walking off, only this time he had heard one of them throw a comment.

"Get off the planet, you nasty vampire." One of the men mumbled under his breath.

It was then that something clicked in Quinn. Why had the people outside been so unwilling to answer his questions from before? Even if they were strange questions. At the same time, why was Jessica having such trouble?

It wasn't just because she was a vampire; it was because they somehow knew that she was a vampire.

'Two of the things that scared humans about vampires in the past was the influence skill and the fact that they could hide among other humans. I guess they figured out those problems then, but I wonder how.' Quinn thought.

Looking around, he started to notice that each person was wearing a ring. It was rare to see a beast ring that would give stats, so other than a fashion accessory; much wouldn't wear them in the past. However, everyone seemed to be wearing one in the room. Quinn knew the vampires had their own rings, so it wasn't out of the realm of possibility that someone had created something that could detect vampires.

'I don't know whether to be happy or upset. At least the vampires aren't being attacked, but they are being discriminated against.' Quinn thought, looking back at Jessica, who just smiled, telling him that this wouldn't be as easy as he initially thought.

Still, Quinn wasn't going to give up. When looking around, he soon saw another female, and she was wearing white robes that covered her body and wielded a spear on her back. On her own, Quinn saw that someone was approaching her, and Quinn quickly went forward and sat down opposite before the others could reach her.

Seeing that Quinn was there, the others looked at the rings on their hands for a few seconds before kissing their teeth and leaving.

"You should have a good explanation why you decided to deter those people from approaching me." The woman said. She was a brunette female with blonde highlights and green eyes. She stared at Quinn with a serious expression on her face.

"You're the first person who hasn't just outright gotten up and left," Quinn replied. "I believe you know why I'm here if I approached you before them."

The woman sighed as she looked over to where Jessica was and looked around at all the others as well before staring at Quinn himself—noticing that he had next to no beast gear on his body.

"Look, I have nothing against your kind." The woman replied. "Which is why I didn't choose to move away. Our leader has asked us to treat you with open arms, and I will follow his wish. However, joining up with you will greatly affect the test result. Perhaps they might even just fail us all. I have to look out for myself first before I look out for anyone else."

Hearing this, Quinn smiled because he had a plan. All he needed was someone to talk to him, and he was sure he would succeed; as for why he approached this person, there was a specific reason.

"You are from the Graylash family, correct? Or at least from their groups judging by the robes you are wearing." Quinn stated.

Hearing this, suddenly, the woman's eyes lit up, which was not the reaction Quinn was expecting.

"How…do you know that? Do you have an interest in the Graylash family's past?"

"No, the clothes are a trait of the Graylash family. Either way, I am good friends with those in the Graylash family, so I'm happy to hear that you don't have a distrust for them. Anyway, I'm sure you can take the test more than once, no?

"All I'm asking is for you to take the test with us once, and in return, you will be able to obtain this." He placed a king tier dagger on the table. Due to all the low ranking people in the room, he could tell their equipment was at best at the advanced tier level, including the one he was speaking to.

As for Quinn, he had countless high ranking items in his dimensional space for more reasons than one.

"I know your weapon is a spear, but you can always sell the dagger and, in return, buy a better spear for yourself. As I said, you just need to take this test with us; whether we pass or fail, you can keep the weapon and do whatever you want with it."

It sure was an offer that was too enticing, and Quinn could even see some of the others who had overheard who were willing to accept the offer. All he needed to do was have someone hear him out. Whether they disliked the vampires or not, it was only up to a certain threshold. Everyone had a price.

However, for the woman, there was another reason she was interested in the person in front of her, and she wanted to know more.

"I accept." The woman said, picking up the dagger and placing it on her side. "The name is Lucia Song, and as you guessed, I'm part of the Graylash group. I would be interested in knowing what exactly your relations are with them. Especially since you know our traditional clothing."

Hearing this, it looked like Quinn had accomplished the task quite easily. Standing up from the seat, he decided to take Lucia over to the others so they could introduce themselves. While walking, though, Quinn thought he would figure out one thing.

"Do you mind telling me what planet we are currently on? Is this Earth?" Quinn asked.

Lucia, chuckled thinking it was a joke.

"Earth? For someone who says they are friends of the Graylash group but don't know that we are on one of their planets, it's a strange thing to ask. Besides, there aren't many that would choose to stay on Earth; there is far too much fighting."

'Fighting?' Quinn wanted to ask more questions, but just as he was about to, he saw Jessica was already in front of them.

"I can't believe it… and you did it so easily? Did you bribe her, promise to go on a date with her or something?" Jessica asked. "Nevermind, who cares? We can finally take the test!"

Running over, Jessica went to register everyone. Other than Quinn, the rest had used their real names, and they were told they wouldn't have to wait long for their turn to enter the test room. Jessica and Lucia were discussing with each other their abilities and strengths.

For someone who said they could take the test on their own, she sure seemed to be over worrying. Because of this, Quinn didn't really get a chance to come in and ask more questions about what Lucia was talking about before.

'Fighting on Earth? Is there a war going on Earth but not the other planets?' Quinn wondered.

"Okay, everyone who is participating in the Travellers ranking exam, please head through this door. There we will inform you of your test, and it will soon begin."

The door opened, and everyone began to step inside with their groups. They had entered what looked like a large training room, but right at the entrance they had placed something enormous in the front.

The instructor, who was also the examiner, stood in front of it. While the rest gathered.

Immediately though, as Quinn entered, Peter, Minny and he were drawn to the large object placed in the room. Quinn stepped forward carefully, with his mouth widened in surprise.

"I can't…believe it," Quinn said as he stared up.

"What are those idiots doing?" Jessica frowned.

"Haha! Hahaha!" Peter couldn't stop laughing as he looked at the object because it wasn't just any old object; it was a sizable giant statue. "Haha! Haha!" Peter continued to laugh.

So much so that the others were now looking at him and were scorning. The reason why he was laughing was that the statue wasn't just any statue, but it was, without a doubt, a giant statue of Quinn himself.

It was one of when he had shorter hair, his gauntlets in both arms, and the Blue fang armour set was on his body. The detail was quite well done, clearly showing they had put care into it.

[The legendary Hero who defeated the Dalki and put an end to the war]

[Quinn Talen]

'It really is a statue of me.'

"Why is there a statue of you?!" Minny pointed and said out loud for the others to hear.

# Chapter 1579 - The Legendary Hero

Of course, the words from Minny's mouth had certainly gotten the attention of all the participants in the room. There were around fifty of them already in the room, and the young girl hadn't exactly been quiet when she had made her comment. It happened at the worst time, as the participants were all nervous and silent.

The others looked at her, wondering why she would even be in a room like this in the first place, but soon figured out that it was perhaps due to her not exactly being human.

The one thing about the rings was that although they would send a signal when a vampire was close. When there were many, it was impossible to tell who was and who wasn't a vampire. They could have just been getting a reading by going close to the others. Doing this type of action wouldn't exactly be discreet.

One among the group, the one closest to Quinn, tilted forward and looked at his face.

"They look nothing alike." The man stated. A few more checked to see if what the little girl was saying was true. Although none of them thought they would see anything, after all the hero, in a place like this? And there were many reasons why they knew it would be impossible. Still, none of them could see the resemblance to the person there or the statue.

Quinn looked up at the statue, its face was certainly his, however it was his appearance from before he had become a celestial vampire. Each evolution had made his body mature a bit, yet it wasn't to a degree that he became a completely different person.

No, the reason people couldn't recognise him was due to Quinn currently using Peter's Soul Weapon. The special mud mask that gave him the appearance of Chucky.

"Little girl, I understand what you're trying to say." The examiner said making a fist and placing it next to his heart. "You see your father as a Hero, correct, just like the one in the statue here."

Quinn was happy that there was a sensible person here, who made up a perfect excuse. Although he didn't mind revealing himself eventually, for now he would prefer learning more about this new world. If it had really been a millennium, he could only imagine the chaos that might ensue if someone claimed to be him, even if they did look the same.

"No." Minny shook her head. "That's not what I meant!"

Quickly, Quinn went to the girl's side and whispered.

"Minny, for now we need to keep it a secret.".

Understanding the situation a bit, she smiled and just nodded away. The examiner looked like he was ready to explain a few things, but before he could, there was one more distraction that hadn't stopped.

"Hahaha!" Peter was on the floor, rolling around as he couldn't stop laughing. "They keep thinking you're a dad…and that statue. Have I gone crazy? Or am I daydreaming this all again?"

It was strange for Peter, having known someone for so many years, having been close to such a person, and then suddenly to see a statue of them. Imagining how his oldest friend was feeling made the situation even funnier to the Wight.

"Hey, stop laughing!" Someone from the crowd shouted. "That's disrespectful to the Hero!"

"Yeah, it's really rude, and I fail to see what's so funny?" Another female commented.

Pulling himself together, Peter got off the floor and took a deep breath. He hadn't laughed like that since he had become a Wight. Although he did notice that his emotions were coming back more to him as time went on.

Perhaps the passing of time had helped with that as well.

"Hero? If I remember correctly, he was a vampire, no? If you ask me, none of them should be here. I can't believe this damned planet worships him so much." A large man scoffed. He was sleeveless and had a fairly big sword on his back.

"If you don't like it, then leave the planet. No one is forcing you to be here." Others replied, as they turned around, and started to berate the man. Most seemed to not like how he was talking.

Seeing this, left Quinn a little confused. The man wasn't shy about stating his dislike for vampires. It seemed like a lot of people on the planet disliked vampires, yet they were clearly upset when they were making rude comments about him.

"Do you really believe the Dalki were such a big threat back then?" The large man continued to say. "He introduced the world of vampires to us. The Dalki never even reached Earth. I'm sure there were plenty strong enough to fight against the Dalki. Everything in the history books is just vastly exaggerated. They were just weak and couldn;t fend for themselves, they deserved what came to them."

Suddenly, a gust of wind went past many of the examiners faces, some had even been pushed away slightly, and the next second the sleeveless man felt his shirt having been grabbed.

"PETER!" Quinn shouted to stop the Wight.

The man hadn't even seen Peter move, the rest hadn't either, and now his fist was inches away from the person's face. He had only stopped when his name had been called.

"Do you have any idea how many lives were lost in that fight? Do you really think you can even imagine how many sacrifices had to be made in the fight against the Dalki?! Were you just born a piece of turd?!" Peter shouted.

"It's okay." Quinn said, clenching his own fist. Hearing Peter remind him of the price they had paid, the celestial vampire seriously wanted to hit the man as well.

"But it's not okay." Jessica suddenly spoke up. "Just like that man said. If it wasn't for Quinn Talen, the Hero of humanity and vampires, then none of us would have been here today. And that's right, remember he was a vampire, a human turned vampire that gave his life so all of us could live. Even this piece of scum right here."

She then leaned in, touching Peter's arm, and whispered in his ear.

"Just let him go, he's not worth it, and we won't be able to take the test."

Hearing this, Peter let go and walked back to where Quinn was.

'Just who created that Wight to be this strong? I wasn't even able to see him. Who are all these strange people? But at least they seem to care…care about the past.' Jessica thought.

Lucai just nodded her head in agreement. While keeping to herself, unlike a certain someone she knew there wasn't more to be said and didn't want attention to be on her. There was enough of that being a human taking a test with the others.

Through that little spat, Quinn did find out one thing, though. It was the fact that everyone believed he had died. Although he had merely gone into eternal slumber, to the world, they had lost their Hero that day.

It made him feel a little strange, knowing the world thought of this.

'The question is…is it better that the people believe Quinn Talen is dead? Perhaps, the world has become a better place. If that's the case, then Quinn Talen doesn't need to come back…and maybe I can enjoy my life.' Quinn smiled to himself.

[3% of the system has synced]

[Some system functions are now online]

[Inspect skill available]

'3%? It looks like it's moving along a bit nicer, and I can feel my body is lighter already.' Quinn thought the system notification appearing was a bit ironic. Perhaps in this world, his powers were not needed. Everything had been dealt with.

Clearing his throat, the examiner tried to ignore everything that had happened so far and get things back on track.

"The test will soon commence." The examiner said in an upbeat voice. "However, before that, as always we have the statue here by my side to represent our Hero Quinn Talen.

"As stated by some of you earlier. Without him, the planets that we live on, the people you see on the street, and the vampires and humans standing by your side wouldn't exist today. However, the world is still under threat, and the planets we live on still contain beasts.

"Beasts which provide us with very special crystals used to power our everyday items. As you can see on the statue by my side, even our Hero, Quinn Talen, had fought using beast armour and specially designed gauntlets to fight off the vicious Dalki! The world is wide and vast, and as we continue our exploration there may be a day when we run into our own troubles, or perhaps even other creatures like ourselves.

"It is important that we equip ourselves with the best gear possible."

Hearing the man talk about himself, was making the celestial vampire cringe a little inside. Shivers were running up and down his body. He had never fought to gain fame or things like this. Honestly, he wanted to leave the room.

"This is why our roles as Travellers are important!" The examiner said. "So let the exam begin, and I wish you all luck on your journey to become Travellers. Perhaps you can become as great as Quinn one day, who defeated the Dalki, 1016 years to date."

The last sentence had raised Quinn's ears and the surrounding noise had been drowned out.

'A….a thousand and …sixteen years?!' Quinn looked at Peter and the two of them had a horrified look on their faces.

Their worst assumption seemed to have been true.
