# Chapter 1850: The last of Pure.

After the first war with the Dalki, many of the large continents from before were nonexistent. Due to fights, large spaceship blasts, attempted nuclear missiles that had backfired, and more, it had caused much of the land to split and the sea levels to rise.

Some of the land had simply been sunk into the sea or had burst into nothing but particles to go into space or the layer of atmosphere around the world. However, what this did was cause many islands to appear all over the place.

Many of them were left unexplored due to the fact they were just too small to make a settlement or a Shelter on. So they just stayed there, doing nothing.

Currently, both Sera and Leo were staying on the island together. It was a full day before they were due to fight. The island had a sandy white beach and jungle-like areas in some places, but most of the island actually had next to nothing on it. There were just open spaces where nothing would grow and large rocks that were left in place. In total, to walk around the entire island, it would take about two hours. For a vampire with super speed and who could run, it would take hardly any time at all.

Currently, the two of them were in one of the large empty spaces. The ground was still sand, but there was a large rock that Sera was relaxing on, with a number of his weapons laid out on the side of the rock next to him.

Leo was on his own with his blade held in his hand. He didn't do much but once in a while he would unsheathe the blade and just cut the air. A sharp sound was heard, a high pitched noise that hurt even Sera's ears.

"Why are you even training so hard?" Sera had to ask, frustrated as the sound was getting to him. He had heard it over and over again and thought his conversation would at least put it to a stop for a second.

"Ever since I met you, all you do every day, whenever you have spare time is train. If you have a spare second you train, and now when you should be resting for a big upcoming fight, you are training again."

"Are you some type of robot, has your creator given you a task to do nothing but endlessly train all day, when you are in front of me of something."

"Because, being with you makes me feel bad for doing nothing and do you really think anything you do in the next two days is going to make a difference?"

Leo didn't reply for a second, and once again, after around eight seconds he did another strike again, making the same sound as before.

"Since I have been practicing this strike, my timing and speed has improved by 0.02 seconds. Before I had become a vampire, I believed my body had hit its peak."

"No, in fact, my body had begun to worsen. My reflexes, my attacks, everything was slower."

"On top of that, no matter how much I trained, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't stop it. Do you know how depressing it is when your hard work is producing no results?

"I had to accept the fact that I had gone past my peak and I would never be the man I once was."

"Now, my body is different, my hard work is rewarded. I haven't reached my peak and even now I am able to improve my speed."

"By 0.02 seconds. Are you listening to yourself? Do you really think that's going to make a difference?"

"Why don't you try improving in other ways? Drinking some blood, or becoming some top vampire or something" Sera complained.

"Today I have improved by a fraction, but all these small improvements will add up, and one day I believe it can be the difference between life and death."

"Either way, I do this to remind myself that my body has not yet reached its peak, that there is still room to grow."

Sera folded his arms, but he soon looked to his side and picked up a dagger from the rock, throwing it out as hard as he could and he had aimed it towards Leo.

Immediately, Leo saw the energy thrown at him through his ability, he turned his head and drew his blade at the right moment. He knew that the power of his Qi and the impact of his sword would not be enough, so he had no choice but to use his vampire aura.

Hitting the dagger upward, he had deflected it. It spun in the air but soon started to move back down and headed straight towards Leo, ready to strike him again. A clang was heard as the knife was hit, time and time again, and the dagger, no matter how many times it was being deflected, continued to come back.

"That there that you are fighting against, is an intermediate tier beast dagger." Sera explained.

"It has an active ability to move towards its target when thrown, no matter where they are. That's it. Usually after getting knocked once, the dagger is useless."

"But of course, in my hands, it has become a demon tier dagger."

"It's now just as strong as a demon tier weapon, which is why you are unable to break it, and it's also why its simple active skill has become quite useful in this situation."

"It will continue to attack you until either I tell it to stop, or until you are dead. Now this is what I call power."

"Maybe, rather than just focusing on your body for improvement, you should try and increase your vampire powers or something similar to it."

"In fact, I have an offer for you. I can tell that you care a lot about this fight, and these people that we are about to meet, they are strong right? So then I have two offers for you."

"One, give me your weapon before they arrive and I can boost it to the demon tier level for you."

It was the first time Leo had heard Sera make such an offer, he didn't know it was possible for him to boost other weapons other than the ones he was using, yet here he had learned that he could.

"Then here is my second offer to you. I haven't met someone that I have liked in a very very long time, and I like you, Leo."

"If you choose to be my subordinate and follow me, then I will give you the power you need to defeat whoever you wish. I can promise you that on my name as God of War."

Hearing the second offer, Leo turned his head away immediately. "I'm afraid i can not. It's not that I don't like you, and perhaps in another world, at another time, if the two of us met, I would accept your offer."

"But right now my allegiance is to only one person, and that is Quinn Talen. So I'm afraid I'll have to decline your offer."

"I thought as much." Sera smiled as he laid by the rock and stopped his flying knife from attacking. It went back to where Sera was and he had caught it in his hand placing it back down. The whole time while talking, Leo was deflecting the blade. His concentration was beyond normal people.

"But think about the first offer, I know you wish to do this with your own power, but everything we use, even our very existence is borrowed from something even if that is the energy of the universe itself."

Although Leo hadn't planned to take any of the offers that had been made by Sera, his words did get him thinking. Leo had been training, in many ways the same way as he had always done. He felt that it was because it allowed him to improve, but maybe there was a better way, and a way to increase other aspects.

Sitting down on the sand Leo started to meditate, he started to focus on the energy inside his body. He could see the yellow Qi energy swirling around, and also the red energy in its body, but it looked a little unstable.

"It has felt this way for a while now, as if the blood energy is too much for this body to handle, but is there something I can do?"

Focusing, Leo sat there for a while, an hour went past, and eventually a loud grunt was heard from the sand, Immediately, Sera got up from his rocks and jumped over landing in front of Leo. He could see his face, the veins running through his neck, and the flask that contained human blood in it had been consumed.

"Are you okay?" Sera asked.

"Yes... I am better than okay." Leo said, lifting his head. The worst part was already over and he had been enduring the pain for a while now. Leo could feel it, his whole body felt better, stronger, faster.

"I have evolved." Leo had successfully evolved from a vampire knight, and had finally, after a long wait, become a vampire lord. He was ready for Zero and Chris if they were to step foot on the island.

***

# Chapter 1851: Students Clash. (Part 1)

For vampires, there were mainly three different types of evolutions they could have. A regular vampire, a vampire noble, and a vampire lord. Most vampires would remain vampires. They could train hard, try to improve, yet could never get their body to evolve to the noble level.

It was similar to humans that had just a limited amount of MC cells, or remained at a certain ability level for so long. Then there were the vampire nobles. At times there would be those that would be born with such bodies, however in other cases, there would be those that evolved into vampire nobles.

At times, there was a little help needed from the leaders, there were rituals and techniques that could bring out the energy that was stuck in their body that would allow them to move onto the next level of a vampire nobel. Of course this wouldn't work if they were just never destined to be at the vampire noble level to begin with.

The very best vampire nobles were usually selected to become vampire knights for their family. Vampires respected power greatly and found it hard to take orders from those that they saw below them.

However, if one became a vampire knight, according to tradition, it meant that they were unable to become a successor to the family. They were unable to become the leader.

When a leader picked their vampire knights they would usually have this in mind, and at the same time they would be training a successor. This would usually be a direct son or daughter of the current leader, but this wasn't just due to family ties, there was a reason for this.

All of the vampire leaders had evolved to the stage of vampire lord. Since vampires wouldn't like to serve someone weaker than them, this had become somewhat of a minimum requirement, although not an official requirement.

Being a direct descendent meant, in most cases, that they had the ability to evolve their body to the final stage of a vampire lord. In some cases, they also had rituals to summon forth the power as well.

But doing so too early would be a mistake. It was always best for a vampire to reach the peak of the evolution they were at before doing any forced rituals for evolution. Otherwise, it would greatly affect their growth.

Of course, leaders at times would train more than one successor in case anything happened to one of them, and all of these successors would have the potential to evolve to the vampire lord stage. This had brought on the thought that the vampire knights were unable to evolve to the vampire lord level.

This was not true, it was just that if a good leader saw that one could turn into a vampire lord, they would raise them as one of the successors.

Which was why, when Quinn was creating his family, he had thrown all of that tradition and logic out of the window. On top of that, no one knew why, but those that he had turned, or those that became special vampire subclasses, pretty much disregarded the normal rules that they knew before.

In fact, no one really knew what Quinn was right now, because it was clear he was no longer a vampire lord, and no one before him had ever been able to surpass that level.

Leo, all on his own, had activated the red aura in his body to allow his body to evolve. He had done what the ritual usually would have done in its place.

Immediately, he grabbed the blade, and struck the air. Sera was expecting to hear the constant ring he had heard before, but there was no sound this time, not even when the sword had gone through the air.

"I have to thank you for your advice." Leo smiled as he placed his sword away.

"I have to admit, I was considering your other offer of improving my weapon, but I don't think I will be needing it anymore, and besides, victory earned through one's own struggles is far more rewarding."

The night was spent quietly for the two of them, and it looked like even Sera was setting something up. He had told Leo he would be exploring the island as he looked at the shape of the landscape for the entire area.

Since Leo had been taking this fight seriously, Sera who respected Leo had decided to take it seriously as well. Then, when the sun rose, it was finally the next day. The two of them waited, walking around the island and looking out at the sea to see if they could spot anyone or anything.

It wasn't yet noon, or the meeting time, but it was the only thing they could do. Time felt like it was moving at a snail's pace. Whenever they would check the time thinking 30 minutes had passed, it had only been 10.

Then finally, exactly when it was midday, at 12:00 o'clock on the dot, Sera spotted something coming out of the water. It was a small sized submarine that had a large clear outer glass front.

It broke through the waves and stopped short of the island by about twenty metres out in the sea. The lid of it opened up, and jumping out of it and standing now on the body of the submarine were two people.

One with scars covering his whole body, he had no shirt on at all, but had two katana-looking blades on his back, and then there was Zero. With a single katana style blade by his side exactly like Leo.

The second Leo saw the two, his heart started to thump louder, stronger, and a strange feeling was rushing all over him.

"So it really was you this whole time. You were really Zero, Master Kasu." Leo stated.

"You look different compared to that time. The time we both decided to part ways from each other, many years ago."

Kasu looked like a middle aged man in his forties. There were no significant details that would make him stand out. Unlike the mountain of man that was next to him, he had a scruffy beard on his face, a fierce look, and long hair, although it was tied up in a ponytail.

As for what Leo meant by different, it was because his master was already a relatively old man when Leo knew him, and now he looked younger. However, without a shadow of a doubt this was him.

After meeting Chris and learning that all of Pure knew how to use Qi, for a while now Leo had assumed that the leader, the man named Zero, was actually his master. However, he felt like there was a chance that it wouldn't be true.

It was just someone else, who looked like him, but that wasn't the case at all. Leo had heard from Quinn about what he had seen, he had witnessed himself how far Pure were willing to go, experimenting with those from the Bree family and more. The man that he used to know, the one he used to call master, would have never gone so far.

"I can see your upset." Kasu shouted.

"Why though? Your appearance has also drastically changed from when I last saw you as well. You look younger and stronger. Isn't it for the same reasons as me?"

Leo didn't know what to say, the words wouldn't form in his mind. "Why have you done all of this, couldn't you have just passed on in peace. You would have been able to rest with the others."

Zero started to laugh out loud. "You really believe that, because let me tell you now, I know that's not true at all. I have learned how the world works Leo, unlike you. We are nothing in this entire world, nothing."

"Our lives mean nothing but I am the one that is going to make it so our lives truly mean something in this entire universe, and that includes you as well."

Leo just shook his head. The tone of voice, the anger, and power behind his words, wasn't how his master used to speak.

"I understand the loss for you was great back then, and it is hard to move on... but in this life, you can't always be looking for someone to blame. In the end there was nothing we could do, and those loved ones have moved on, we should focus on the new lives that are in front of us!"

Taking out his blade from his side, Zero pointed it toward Leo. "You using those words truly means your eyes have yet to be opened. You can't even realise that the man next to you... is like them."

"He is one of them. I am afraid you have gone to the other side and it's too late."

"I agreed to your terms and the one that will be fighting you Leo, is the one that I have raised from the beginning."

"The new me, raising one that can't die to those fools like the Dalki. Chris! Take him out."

# Chapter 1852: Students Clash. (Part 2)

It looked like Zero was done with talking, as he no longer said any words and instead drew out his sword from his strange colored sheath. The sheath itself was white in colour with several purple spots scattered all over it and when pulling out the blade itself, it had a similar design.

Random purple spots were all over the sword, but both Sera and Leo weren't able to see it for long, because Zero had used it instantly to throw out a large strike of energy. Unlike usual Qi strikes, where one would see a line of aura leave the sword, with Zero there was none of this.

Following his sword, the part of the sea that was in front of him looked to have split in half. Two large walls of water had been created and the land leading up to the island could be seen. Even though the strike couldn't be seen, Sera was ready as he pulled out a round shield, one that looked fairly ancient and beaten up with several dents and brown in colour.

He stood there and dug the shield into the ground, it changed shape turning into what looked like a door, covering both him and Leo behind him. The attack clashed against the shield and a large dent was made, but the attack didn't go through.

"His attack dented this thing... oh well, I have plenty more shields that I can use, but you were right about this not being an easy fight." Sera said.

Sensing that something was now above them, Leo had his blade drawn out and spun around, swinging it, clashing against another weapon. Two hooks looked to be gripping underneath his sword and before he knew it, his whole body was being lifted into the air.

It was a sudden great strike that Leo was unprepared for, to even fight against. When using his ability and sensing the energies, he could tell that Zero had just landed on the beach. Which meant the one that had attacked him right now, and was in the air with him, was Chris.

"I'm sorry, but it looks like this time, we're actually going to have to fight against each other!" Chris shouted, as he lifted his two shark tooth looking weapons that could extend and retract. They were similar to the ones that Chris had before, although these looked different as they were blue in colour, and the ends looked sharper and stronger as well.

Lifting both his arms, Leo was dragged through the air, and then thrown like a whip, back down to the island. Of course Leo could have let go, but he refused to let go of his weapon. A loud crash was heard on the island and a few trees were seen falling.

Throwing out one of his weapons again and extending it, the shark tooth end had touched the ground. Next, retracting the weapon and shortening it, Chris was able to safely pull himself to the ground.

The second he had landed though, a large slash of red aura had hit Chris. It had come out too fast for him to defend against and landed right across his chest pushing him back. Using the weapons he stopped himself from being blown away.

"Now that's some power." Chris commented looking at his chest, which had a shallow scar on it. It had been a long time since he had last been injured. More than anyone in Pure, Chris trained his body and his second stage Qi to its limit.

It was safe to say, in terms of Qi, he had the strongest defense there was on his natural body, yet here he was getting hurt.

"You're not the one that I need to face!" Leo shouted, walking on the ground, and swinging his sword again creating another large red blood strike.

This time, Chris was ready to block it with his weapons, using them to create an X shape with both of them. Feeling the strength of the attack from before he knew he would need both, but something strange happened.

Leo's weapon lit up red and the red strike had split. It went around him completely, joining together again into a large strike and had gone straight towards his back. It was a large hit that sent Chris toward Leo, who charged forward.

Seeing this, Chris went to swing his weapon but could suddenly feel that his arms were being dragged a certain direction away from Leo. That was because he was using his soul weapon to redirect the attack.

Swinging his red sword, the strike had hit Chris's shoulder and had gone a couple inches deep before it stopped. Leo could feel he was battling against an immense amount of Qi, so he was unable to go deeper, but the great force and strength still sent Chris skidding across the ground.

"This is his best student?" Leo asked. "The best that Zero could teach, the best of the best?"

When Chris finally stopped, his entire body was starting to turn red. His skin, his face, everything. All of the power and strength inside him was coming out. This was Pure's secret weapon. The type of soul weapon that those from Pure had learned.

"I wouldn't have expected anything less from you!" Chris said.

"I thought had gotten good enough to beat you without using this, but it looks like I wasn't the only one that was improving."

Charging in, Chris ran forward with both of his weapons over his head. He was faster than before, and the Qi covering his body and being used in him was causing him to be beyond superhuman.

It was then that Leo had done something that seemed strange, he had placed his blade back in its sheath. Chris took notice of this but didn't worry as he continued forward and swung both of his weapons down.

At the right moment, Leo took one step forward and pulled with all his strength the blade out of his sheath as fast as he could. It came out with such a large force of red energy that the sword looked like it was getting wider as it went through the air.

A solid red form of energy was following Leo's sword. It touched the weapons in Chris's hands, and had gone right through them like butter, breaking them in an instant. Parts of his blade fell to the floor, and as soon as Chris's body touched the red aura, he could feel it slicing through his skin right now.

Warm blood was falling from his chest. "Am I going to die... the fight didn't even last long. How did he manage to grow so strong so quickly?"

"I still remember the last time I met him. What have you done that I haven't done?"

"I trained.. I trained every day, every second to improve myself and my body, so why is there such a large gap between us now compared to then? Am I weak?" Chris thought.

As he fell onto the ground he saw Leo's face. "No... I'm not weak, I should at least know that of all people. He is just that strong."

Lying on the floor, Chris could tell that the wound across his chest was quite deep, but with Qi he could use it to activate his cells in order to heal, himself a bit more, and he had plenty of it. However, for him the fight was over. He knew he was outmatched.

"It looks like you won after all this time. You were the better student after all." Chris said, his voice a bit shaky. Before he knew it, his eyes were tearing up. He was crying but he didn't know why.

"I'm at least happy, that I lost to you, and that you are the one that gets to finish me off." Chris said, closing his eyes, accepting death.

"You are just a lost person." Leo stated. "And I can also tell that you are someone who doesn't have a bad bone in his body. I may be blind, but that allows me to see more than the person who is actually in front of me."

"There is a lot I can tell from the way you speak and how your aura reacts. You can still change, you can still make a difference."

Leo then looked over in another direction.

"Unfortunately for him, it's a lost cause."

***

# Chapter 1853: Alone.

Chris continued to lay on the ground, even though he was now much better. The wound on his body had somewhat healed to the point where it wouldn't cause him any more discomfort or harm. There would be a scar left there, but that was just another of the many to add to his collection, and he actually wished to keep this one.

Leo had departed shortly after defeating Chris and telling him with those words. So now Chris was left with his own thoughts, thinking back at the whole situation and what had happened.

"I lost... From how Master talked about this, I always thought that if the two of us fought, it would be to the death." Chris thought.

"The hatred Master felt when he talked about his past, he had attempted to pass it onto me."

"However, I never did feel the same hatred as he did. It was hard for me to relate. But I was in his debt."

"So, of course, I would do as he told me, and if it was to just defeat one person, then so be it."

"It was just, I was expecting Leo to carry the same hatred as his Master, but it looks like he doesn't. Either way, I've jost now... so what does that mean for me."

Chris pulled his upper body up but was still on the ground. Once in a while, he would feel the whole island shake. Without a doubt, this was the power of Zero. It seemed like their fight was still going on as well.

"If Master hasn't beaten his opponent now, it must mean the person he's fighting against is strong as well." Chris thought.

"These people, they are incredibly strong, and they're the ones that are saving the humans and the planet."

When thinking about it more and the Pure's goal, Chris thought it was all pointless. Humans were weak creatures. Even if they taught everyone the power of Qi, there were only so few people that could amount to what he and his Master could do.

At the end of the day, even then, Chris had lost his battle against Leo because the latter was a vampire who also knew how to use Qi as well. And alongside those with abilities, the humans were also able to survive the first war.

If they truly got rid of all the abilities in the world and replaced them with Qi, then can they beat the Dalki if the latter were to return? Could they have defeated the vampires as well? Right now, perhaps it was just due to his recent defeat, but in his head, the answer was no. The Qi was still far off compared to the power of abilities, and he felt removing the abilities would only weaken the whole race against external threats.

After all, they wouldn't be on the losing end right now otherwise.

Letting out a big sigh, Chris was on the verge of giving up. Whatever happened to him, he would let it be, if that meant the ants on this island and other insects were to eat his body, then that would be fine as well.

"Look at me, without any goal, I feel completely lost." Chris thought as he heard the whole island rumble again, and a rise in power was felt coming from a certain direction.

"I should at least see this through to the end. This could be the last time I see him. I should at least thank him for giving me the life that I have now." Chris stood up and started to head toward the direction of the fight.

On his way there, the entire jungle was ruined and burnt. This continued for more than a kilometre, and he still hadn't reached the fighting yet, but moving the Qi to his ears, he could hear in the distance people conversing.

"You're a fool!" A voice exclaimed, "You have no idea who that marking belongs to! How can you trust the words of someone like that? You say you understand us, but if you did, you would have never agreed to let him mark you."

"Every one of us just does things for our own gain, and it's true even for me right now! Whatever he's promised you, you will never get it. Do not believe him!"

The context of the conversation made no sense to Chris, and suddenly, everything went silent. The voice died out, the sound of fighting stopped, and the energy he felt earlier dispersed as well. Upon getting closer, Chris came across a large slash made across the whole island.

Water had filled the deep cut, making a strange type of stream of seawater. It was unnatural, to say the least, and was clearly a result of the battle that had taken place. After a few more minutes of walking ahead, Chris finally reached the beach. He could see several of these cuts on the island, now filled with water, and what surprised him even more were the corpses of fishes and other sea creatures floating on the water's surface.

On the largest crack on the island, which Chris had followed, he could see Leo staring outward.

Looking to his left and then to his right, Chris was expecting to find Zero somewhere on the beach, dead and blood to be spilt everywhere, but the latter was nowhere to be seen at all.

"Where is he? Where is my Master's body?" Chris asked.

"Master?" Sera said, gripping his broken sword. It was a regular sword which most likely broke into half during the fight. Although he had plenty more on his body that he could use, Sera looked reactively tired as well. He shook his head and replied, "That so-called Master of yours decided to run away."

Chris's heart sank when he heard those words. He didn't expect this.

"He... he ran away... but why?"

It made no sense in his head. The two of them went everywhere together, and before coming to the island, they knew that this was possibly their final stint. If they were to lose this, then the two of them had done what they could. They would fight to the death, yet his Master had run away and, on top of that, had done so without him.

"I told you. That man has changed." Leo added. "I don't know if he was different when you first met him."

"Perhaps he was softer and closer to the man that I remember, but now he is a man who is willing to abandon someone who has been by his side for so long."

"No, wait, even calling him a human would insult all of us."

Chris fell to his knees because, in his head, he had lost two things on this day. The only person he ever really knew, someone like a father to him, and the whole purpose of his life.

"That damned slimy bastard!" Sera threw the broken sword onto the ground in frustration.

"He already had a lot of power, and then he must have borrowed an enormous amount from that sicko, and who would have thought, huh?"

"The person who has secretly been running Pure, the very top of the whole organisation, has an ability himself! He certainly left that one till the end."

After Cera vented his frustration, Chris was left speechless by Zero's hypocrisy.

Leo had come at the tail end just to see a few slashes of their battle. He was unsure if Zero had decided to leave just because he had turned up, but it certainly did make the latter act differently.

Perhaps, Zero even thought that Chris was dead after seeing Leo leaving him to make his final decision.

"I'm beat." Sera sighed, lying in the sand. "I'm tired of chasing after these guys. We got one of them, so that should be enough, right?"

"Besides, all the Shelters are now back in the Earthborn Group's control, and the Vampire Soldiers are doing well."

"The people seem to have taken a liking to them after saving their backside, who would have thought."

Leo was unsure if this was the right decision. Seeing Zero's action upon meeting the latter today, he felt that he would come back some day regardless. Still, the only reason why Leo decided not to give chase was that he would continue to train with his body, and if he met Zero in the future, or if the latter were to he would be ready to take him on.

"Anyway, I don't plan to stay here for long. So let's deal with the elephant in the room." Sera got up and brushed the sand off his armour and clothes. "Now, what should we do with this guy?"

Both Leo and Sera were now looking toward Chris.

***

# Chapter 1854: Like Brothers.

Inside a prominent shelter on Earth, everything felt peaceful. But, to the people inside, peace felt strange. It was something they hadn't perceived in a long time. At the centre of the shelter was a huge military base, and the Shelter itself had walls around it for protection against the outside. Although, some thought it was unnecessary now.

Many of those currently on Earth hadn't been to this place in a long time, Earth. They were enjoying every moment they spent on the land. They were now feeling peaceful with the dread of powerful enemies not hanging over their heads since the Dalki War ended and Graham, leader of the Dalki, was defeated by Quinn Talen.

Pure, the group that had caused terror in the upper management of the military had been cleansed and taken out, and now things could operate how they should. However, there was still much discussion in the streets, as political undercurrents were now igniting with questions like what would happen with the vampires and more.

Currently, however, most of them were just happy that there was no longer an enemy that they needed to be scared of, and they were enjoying this time of peace.

Houses and other buildings were being rebuilt in the shelter from good materials. People no longer had to live in cramped apartments or makeshift places built just from earth abilities anymore because they earlier feared enemy attacks would destroy them again.

Gardens, forest patches and even parks were now in the shelters. It was all there, including a busy marketplace, in the high shopping street, and there were smiles on the people's faces as they shopped.

"Sorry, sir, if you're not going to buy anything, can you please move?" A woman who was selling fresh fruit from her stall, requested.

A figure in robes was standing in front of the shop and seeing that he had a sword by his side, she felt a bit nervous. Few people nowadays carry weapons in the open, especially in the middle of the day like this.

"Sorry, I was just waiting for someone. I will move out of your way." The robed man replied as he stepped a little ahead and soon found the person he had been waiting for with the help of his ability, as a large ball of energy was now in front of him.

"Did you get everything you wanted?" He asked. When the lamp lights fell on his face, it was revealed he was Leo.

"Yes, I got food that should last me for a few days at least."

"I tried looking for something that would suit you, as I heard there is a black market for it, but I still haven't been able to find a good lead." Chris replied.

"I told you not to worry about that. Come on, we have work to do." Leo said, walking away.

Chris and Leo had been travelling together for around a year now. It had been a year since that day, and Chris could still remember everything that happened as if it were yesterday.

After the fight between Zero, Sera, Leo and him, Chris was left there on the beach, and Sera drew out his sword and pointed at Chris, asking him. "What do you plan to do now?"

Chris didn't react to this and even somewhat accepted the imminent death because he felt like he had lost everything. It was a question he had been thinking about as soon as he lost the fight: what would he do now?

"You're a free man from today." Leo said, "You can do whatever you want, but if you plan to cause trouble for us, or continue to get in our way, then I am afraid I will have to end your life now."

It was then that a sudden thought came into Chris's head. There was one other person he knew about, one he knew about quite well other than Zero, and that was Leo.

"I... I... I wish for you to take me in. I want to follow you and help you." Chris then placed his head in the sand as he begged. "No, please, let me help you. Then at least, I might be able to atone for some of the sins that I have committed."

After that day, he and Leo travelled together, searching for two people. The first person was Zero, the leader of Pure. With Chris, they knew all the back routes and their doings from the past.

So far, they had even found some bases that were still operating, and Leo had taken it upon himself to get rid of them. Then there was another person, who he felt was his responsibility for a while now, and that was Erin.

However, there had been no news or sightings of her for a while. It seemed like she had just disappeared from the face of the Earth, but Leo would keep looking and keep going until he found these two people.

While walking through the streets, there were some things that Leo thought about. For one, the Cursed faction. They were still operating and going travelling from planet to planet, trying to sort out the world's problems.

As for Leo, he had cut communication with all of them. They didn't need his help or his involvement, and he didn't need to bother them with his troubles. Earth was a good place to live now.

He felt bad that they might be searching for him and whatnot but was sure that they would all understand. The one thing that Leo was truly upset about was Quinn. He wished he would have been there to talk to Quinn in the latter's final moments.

He imagined the whole thing must have been scary for Quinn, and there were many things that Leo wanted to say. After all, there was so much weight on such a young boy's shoulders that it was unbelievable, but the world continued to put pressure on him and his name because he was the only one that could have saved them.

When heading through the streets, Leo suddenly smelt blood. He used his ability to spread out the vision of the place and could tell that there was a vampire in sight.

Now that more vampires were living among the living, there were more cases where they would act out and attack the local people. But, of course, Leo didn't agree with this, so he would put a stop to it. The only thing was, Leo would often just set off on his own, running to the crime scene, just like he had done now.

"Man, that guy really never rests or takes a break, does he? He seemed to forget that I don't have a good nose like him either. How am I supposed to know where he went?" Chris grumbled but was used to it by now.

As he continued to walk down the street, he knew the two would meet up eventually anyway. They always did. He decided to use this time to go through the stalls.

"I still haven't found a replacement for my weapons that Leo broke. Maybe we should get off Earth."

"I mean, Pure had bases on other planets that Zero could have gone to. It will be an excuse to go hunting as well, and then I can get a new weapon." Chris thought.

He went past a few rare weapon stalls. The Traveller profession still existed in this time, but it was rare to see them on Earth since there were no beasts to hunt on this planet. The strong Travellers on Earth mainly came here to take a break or a vacation.

Which was why, when Chris saw the choice of weapons, he couldn't help but let out a large sigh in disappointment.

"I might have something you like." Just then, a voice said by his side.

Chris waved it off, as these crummy people would often appear, trying to sell fakes to people who didn't know any better. Turning around, Chris was ready to walk away when the person suddenly appeared in front of him.

He was wearing a thick black mask that looked like a fox.

"My, you have changed a lot in a short time. You don't even show any respect anymore." The man said, lifting his mask and revealing his face.

"...Zero..." Chris frowned, not delighted to see him.

# Chapter 1855: A second chance.

It has been more than a year since the fight on that island and the last time Chris saw Zero. In fact, Chris had come to somewhat enjoy his life while travelling with Leo. Although he had just been helping the latter and going along with him with no real purpose of his own, there was also no pressure from the latter unlike it used to be from the person who was now standing in front of him, Zero.

In recent months, Chris has also enjoyed using his abilities to help others. At every shelter or new location, there was always someone in need, and Chris was able to help them on a personal level using his power. The reaction on their faces always warmed Chris' heart.

It was much better than the days when he had to order around a bunch of subordinates to handle everything and only stepped on the field when they needed his strength. However, in the past year, he never forgot about Zero.

Those many years he had spent training under him were impossible to put behind and forget, and he knew that this day would come when he would stand in front of his old master once again. It was just that he didn't expect to meet the latter out of nowhere, in the middle of this street.

"Can you spare some time and have a chat with me? I was waiting until you separated from him." Zero asked, not looking in his direction and pretending he was going through the items displayed in the street stall.

"When you say him, I'm assuming you are talking about Leo." Chris replied. He too wasn't looking at Zero, and was fumbling through the shop's stuff.

"I thought when we meet again next time, you will challenge him yourself. And what do you have to do with me? I thought you didn't even know I was alive."

Zero scoffed at that comment like Chris was a fool.

"You really think that was the case? I could sense your energy, your fights, and I know there is a lot in you. Besides, I also know Leo better than anyone, he would have never done anything like that."

"Anyway, I would like to talk to you in private, would you at least give me that? It's important to me. You're important to me."

Although Chris thought he had managed to get rid of all attachment to this person, these words seemed to draw him in. He wanted to believe it was true, even though he was pretty sure they weren't.

However, in the end, Chris agreed to go off with Zero and both of them left the busy street. He wasn't too worried either since there was a trick that Chris could do that would always bring Leo to him, and it was to just extend his Qi aura.

The only problem was that others who could sense Qi, tended to react to it as well. Nevertheless, it was a good backup. Leaving the market, they walked through a large meadow of green grass, and not far into the meadow was a large hill with a tree at the top.

They soon reached there, and Chris sat down. Then Zero did the same while looking out.

"I'm sorry, Chris." Zero's first words came out as a big surprise.

"You might be surprised by these words, but the reason why I am saying this is that I haven't exactly been telling you the truth. But I think it's because I have realised that I never wanted you to kill Leo."

For a second, Chris wondered if the person next to him was really Zero. It felt like he was talking to two completely different people because the Zero he knew before would have never said anything like this.

"I realised that I was lying to myself. And even when I got the power to fight, I still relied on you, and the truth is, it was because I couldn't do it."

"I couldn't kill one of my own students. Not when I had already lost them all."

"So you're saying I was just raised to do your dirty work?" Chris asked, clenching the grass blades. He had activated a bit of his Qi, and the grass around it had been pushed away, slicing and floating off in the wind.

"The goal has changed, Chris, from what it originally was, and I'm more determined than before to see its end." Zero spoke with determination.

"The members of Pure, the high ranking numbers, I have been gathering them again. Teaching them the ways of the Qi and making them stronger than before."

"We still have the info on how to make the Hybrid beasts. We still have information that has been gathered from other places and more. We can not only make others better but you as well. We can still complete this all together." Zero then put out his hand as if he was looking for a handshake.

Chris glanced at it for a second, but his whole body was shaking. He didn't even know what the current goal was. If it wasn't to get rid of Leo, then what was it? Either way, to go back to the life he had before or keep the current one, to Chris, the answer was a no-brainer with what he wanted to do.

"Zero, you're not the only one in my life anymore. I have a lot more choices to make and my own life that I now follow." With that said, Chris stood up and began walking away.

"What? You think that's it?" Zero said out loud.

"Have you forgotten everything I did for you? So did you repay me? Well, fine, but I know when Leo dies and you don't have anyone else, you will come back to me and listen to me again."

There were a lot of questions that Chris had in his head as he walked away. First, to ask Zero about his current goal, why he had changed his stance on Leo and what he wanted to do with him. Regardless, if he asked these questions, he would only be dragged deeper into Zero's plans and trap, which he wanted to avoid.

It didn't take long for Chris to get back to the busy street he once was at. Every once in a while, Chris would check to see if Zero was following him, but the latter was nowhere to be found. Honestly, he was quite surprised that Zero could come out of the blue like that already, without him noticing. Although Chris didn't have the same ability as Leo, sensing Qi was still something he could do, just not to the same level of detail.

"Your mind seems full." A voice said.

Turning around, Chris could see he had just walked straight past Leo.

"I guess you're right." Chris scratched the top of his head. "Sorry, I'm just thinking about a lot of things, and seriously I'm still confused about how you can see better than everyone out there who has eyes."

"What did you do?" Leo asked.

"I just went to get some fresh air, I was… thinking about the past again, You know how I get when that happens." Chris gave an excuse and wanted to quickly change the subject. "Anyway, what about you? Did you solve your little vampire problem?"

Leo smiled.

"I did better. I have a lead on one of our targets."

Chris inwardly gulped upon hearing this, wondering if Leo had caught onto the fact that Zero was in this Shelter. What would they do then? Chris just wanted to avoid a confrontation between the two from ever happening again.

"It leads to the infamous Vampire Slayer," Leo added.

Chris let out a large sigh of relief. He was worried there for a second. He did think of telling Leo the truth, but knowing how obsessive Leo was, he would have stopped everything they were doing just to chase down Zero, and currently, they couldn't do that.

"It looks like our luck is turning around." Chris then replied, "So what are we going to do now?"

"We are waiting for someone. She will join us on the rest of the trip and take us to the last location the Vampire Slayer was seen, and we will go from there." Leo explained. "Oh, she's here."

Looking up, Chris saw one of the most beautiful women he had ever seen. He had never seen a face so stunning. She stood there next to Leo, confirming they had the right person.

"Chris, I would like you to meet Silver."

***

# Chapter 1856: A kindle flame.

During the time that Leo had spent in the vampire settlement, he had only gotten along and close to a few people. But he didn't know how most of them were. Sometimes he would wonder how those from the Tenth Family were after the war and what was left of them, at least. Years ago, Leo and Erin had trained them well to make them the Qi powerhouses in the vampire race.

As for the people from other families, he didn't particularly mingle with them much. At the time, when he was a Vampire Knight, the other vampires looked down on him because he was an outsider. However, there was an exception to all of that, and that was Silver.

He really didn't know why but the two of them got on well with each other after their first misunderstanding. Perhaps it was because they were both straightforward with each other. At the same time, although in the past, it didn't look so much since Leo looked more like an old man, the two were actually closer in age than one might think.

There was still a large age gap, just not from the side most people would think at first glance of the two.

"You actually contacted someone?" Chris was surprised. "I don't actually recognise this one. I thought you had lost all contact with those from the Cursed faction, so how did the two of you meet?"

"This someone has a name, and he just told you it's Silver." She glared at Chris.

Her first impressions of him weren't the best. Then again, she didn't really know who he was either.

The run-ins with Pure and vampires were practically non-existent most of the time since Pure's agenda was on the current government and ability users. Another thing to note was that the world had only found out about vampires recently, so it was hard to tell how different groups of people would treat them.

"It was a coincidence, honestly. You know, I have not only been helping people from attacks by vampires but also vampires that have been attacked by humans."

"I don't believe in one side more than the other. Rather, I look at the individual case where see one side has treated the other wrongly."

"One of them belonged to the Thirteenth family, of which Silver is in charge. I had... asked them if Silver was okay, and to pass on a message."

"Since then, we have communicated quite frequently through members of the Thirteenth family and eventually also got onto the subject of Erin."

After saying this name, Silver's whole demeanour turned uneasy. She looked around her as if saying the name itself would bring bad luck, and after talking for a while, the three of them decided to move and get to a more open area. When heading to a large meadow-like field, Chris noticed the hill where he and Zero had talked not too long ago.

"Uhm, maybe we should go to that hill? It looks better. I will race you there!" Chris said as he ran to a slightly smaller different hill that didn't have as nice of a view.

"Since when did you agree to take on a child?" Silver frowned.

"He's not a child, and even if he is acting strange today, he is actually a good-hearted guy. Although one day, I would like to have a child of my own." Leo said as he walked towards the hill where Chris had run up to.

"Oh really, well then I have to ask, is there anyone you have in mind? You do know that dating a human would be impossible for you, and besides, even if you could make it work, you would outlive her."

"It would be more beneficial for you to date a vampire." Silver smirked as she walked ahead of Leo and brushed her hair against the sun. "Perhaps, a beauty like me."

Hearing this, Leo smiled.

"You forgot I am blind. Women to me look similar, just wireframes and balls of energy with only a few variations."

"Sure I can tell girls apart based on the difference in their wireframes, but it is hard for me to... beautify that. Instead, I will prefer someone I get along with."

"Of course, a vampire would be preferable since I wish to have a family. And yeah, maybe someone like you would be nice."

After saying these words, Silver stopped in her tracks. She turned around, and although Leo couldn't see it, her face had turned slightly red, blushing ever so slightly. She was glad at this point that Leo couldn't see.

"Then, how about me?" Silver asked.

The two of them had an inkling for a while, a connection that the two of them felt from when they first met. The only thing was, it was hard to say what that feeling was. This conversation had cleared up the feeling she had, making her take the plunge.

Being a vampire was strange. They had a lot of time on this planet which made them view it differently compared to humans. It wasn't rare for vampires to have multiple partners as well because of this.

However, Silver was always occupied with her responsibilities, and never once, when meeting a person, she had felt this way. This odd feeling in her stomach she was feeling at this moment was new. She had an urge to tiptoe around the other person and keep herself in check to make sure he never saw the other side of her.

The thing was, there were many times where Silver had shown both the good and ugly sides of herself to Leo, and still, she felt no different, and he acted indifferently. Before, she had felt like a person who would always have to do things on her own to protect herself and those in her family, but with Leo around... she was happy for him to do that.

She wanted Leo's seriousness in his tasks, the mission and more to be used and channelled into being with her. The image in her head was a beautiful one.

"I can't." Leo's words pulled her out of her thoughts. "At least I can't yet. I would love to, but there are things that I still need to do, and you know that. Once I have accomplished them, though, I will happily come and seek you out wherever you are, and we can enjoy our time together."

It wasn't the answer Silver was expecting after pouring her heart out like that, but it was one that she liked. Without turning back, she ran off, heading straight to Chris' side right up the hill.

"Are you a baboon?" Silver remarked as soon as she reached the top. "The hill over there is far larger and taller. It has a better view for us to talk about matters."

"Do you really think that matters? Don't you know that Leo is blind? We just needed to get away from the other people." Chris replied.

The two were suddenly having a little argument, but it was because, for one, Silver was acting a bit shy while Chris was being protective over his new friend, the one he saw as his brother. Both of them were jealous of the other.

"Alright," Leo said, reaching the top. "Tell us what you know about Erin."

The argument soon stopped, and Silver instantly switched to work mode.

"Before I tell you this, I want to let you know it's a soft lead, but I know that you are grasping at straws here, and this could work. It's more of a trap than anything rather than information." Silver explained.

"Fex and Samantha have been doing their best to take care of the vampire soldiers that settled on Earth."

"Since Samantha is in a high position in the Earthborn group, she has sway over them."

"Because of this, trial runs were being conducted, and small groups of vampires were being introduced into communities or different human shelters."

"Earlier, they didn't face any significant problems, and the number of vampires was also increasing, but recently, there have been reports of vampire murders."

"Their heads were cut off. And now, every time a new trial has been initiated, the same thing happens. I don't believe this is a human's doing. Instead, I believe that it's the work of our little friend."

To start a fight with the current government after everything they had been through wasn't a smart move, and Leo knew that unless one was simply just acting to the will of their body, something like this wouldn't transpire. And based on this hypothesis, it had to be Erin.

"Just to let you know, another 'Trial' is about to begin. And it's in a Shelter not too far from here. I believe that if we bide our time, she will definitely turn up." Silver suggested.

***

# Chapter 1857: The legendary Blind swordsman. (Part 1)

Due to the methods that Silver and Leo used to communicate, it meant that at times their messages would take several days to arrive. Leo wasn't exactly going out searching for these vampires, they would just pass messages along to each other if they happened to meet.

Only this time, based on where Leo had been in the past, Silver had done well to guess where he would be next, and she was right, relaying the message personally to him. Because of this, it meant that there was little time left to act.

They needed to leave immediately and that was what they had done. Currently, the three of them were traveling via ship. It was sleek, fast, and quite cozy on the inside. The ship itself belonged to Silver, and she had used it to get to Earth.

Although teleporters still existed, there were restrictions at the moment. Since enemies, and more, were frequently using them to attack there were talks of a blanket ban on all of them. According to the latest news, Logan was trying to create a device that would intercept all of the teleporters in a certain area.

— I contacted the vampire soldier who is part of the current expansion plan. Of course, since Fex is the one that is leading this whole thing, it was easy for me to pull some strings. — Silver explained.

— We will be meeting the vampires as bodyguards, although to the outside we will just be teachers. Both me and you have experience in that field, so it shouldn't be too hard to pull that off. Although I'm unsure about your large friend.

This was clearly a mockery of him, throughout the trip, Silver teased Chris, because she really did not know his past, nor why he was with Leo, and for her, he just kind of interfered with her time with Leo.

However, Chris didn't say anything, he didn't reply back at all and just continued to look outside of the window.

— Anyway. — Silver continued.

— Please make note that these vampires will be nervous. They know what happened to the last lot. At the same time, there is a lot of uneasiness with humans in the first place as well. These vampires are committing to a brave task, just because Fex has asked them, telling them all it was what Quinn would have wanted.

— Quinn. — Chris reapted. — That young lad has become quite the hero, huh? It's strange how, at one point I thought the two of us were quite alike. Yet, look at how far he has come now... when did I go down the wrong path.

Hearing the tone in Chris's voice, Leo started to walk over to him. He sat down on the bench that was built into part of the ship, that had a long rectangular window to look at the sky outside.

— Worry, guilt, anxiousness, pain. I can hear that there are many mixed emotions in your voice, and see it in your aura. It hasn't settled down since we left the planet. On top of that you have been more silent than usual. Usually I can't get you to keep your mouth shut.

— You don't have to tell me what is wrong, but if your concern is about what others have done, well look at where Quinn is now, and look at where you are now. At the moment, I would say you are in a better position than him, you still have time to change things, to make your own history and set your own mark, where as for him, it's impossible now.

Chris couldn't help but smile, because he knew that Leo was trying to cheer him up, and for some reason he always knew the right words to say. Although, ever since traveling with Leo, there was one thing that hadn't come back, and that was his passion for training and fighting.

He had remained at a plateau. He did just enough to maintain his current body and powers, but had done nothing to improve, because still in his mind, he had no goal to accomplish.

The ship had finally arrived at the Shelter, which was placed right by the sea. It was a port Shelter. These days goods were rarely delivered via sea, however many humans still enjoyed living near the water even though there was plenty of it.

There were still ships and more as well, but more so for activities than anything else. It was a joy to see people enjoying their time for once. It also was one of the few Shelters that didn't have a complete wall all around it.

The wall only covered the back of the shelter while anyone could access the place via the sea. At the same time, the landing section for space ships was out into the sea from the shelter. Similar to a pier, there was a large metallic bridge that went into the sea.

Then, there was a large rectangular building sticking upwards. A large place for multiple people to store their vehicles, spaceships, and more. For today though, one of the floors of the landing building had been reserved for them, to get on with what they needed to do.

The spaceship landed on a rectangle shaped square that had a red outline, there were many so it didn't matter which one, one would pick. After that, one had to give their handprint, and then a type of elevator would take the spaceship to a specific spot in the Spaceship park.

Taking an elevator down, they went from the 120th floor to the 19th where the entire place had been cleared of ships, and there were a group of ten people standing there waiting for them, and by their side stood a man in military uniform, but he was a Vampire soldier, not a human.

— It's a pleasure to meet you, vampire knight Silver, and her two honored guests. — The vampire soldier said bowing down. Both Leo and Chris were wearing masks that would cover their faces. Both of them had become somewhat well known, either in the human space, or in the vampire space.

The ten vampires behind them were a mix of men and women of all sorts of ages. Although most of them looked to be in their mid twenties, it probably meant they were around 100 to 200 years old.

They seemed nervous about the whole thing, but at the same time excited. They had also settled down when they could smell that one of the two behind the masks was also a vampire.

— Everything has been set up for them by Samantha and Fex. All of the vampires will live in the same apartment building next to each other for support. Their rent has been paid for a year and if all goes well that should be enough to get them on their own two feet.

— The task for you and your bodyguards is to protect them from attackers and to diffuse the situation if there are problems, at least for the first month. After that, we will send somone to check with them once a week to see how they are doing.

— If all goes well, then we will continue this in the same fashion with a similar size group, eventually increasing the sizes. At times, we also hope have events that will bring Vampires and humans together, but you won't have to worry about that for now. — The vampire soldier explained.

A month of bodyguard duty sounded like a long and tiring task, but with no other leads, this would have to do. At least Leo could continue to train for whatever would come his way.

— A month in the same place... it means, there is a chance that Zero will approach me again, I wonder if he followed us. Maybe he already knows that we are here. I know I declined his offer, but I imagine he won't take a 'no' that easy... I know he won't take a 'no' that easy.

While in the middle of their thoughts, and while the vampire soldier was explaining things to the vampires and Silver, the elevator for the spaceships could be heard moving. It was constant as it always was this whole time, as people moved and more, and toward the centre of the floor one could see the mechanism moving, the spaceships dropping down and then being shifted into the right place.

A spaceship had dropped down, and a strange energy had been noticed by Leo's ability.

— Silver, Chris, they're here! — Leo shouted, drawing his sword.

When the ship passed through the 19th floor, down from where only the ships should be, three individuals rolled off the platform and onto the 19th floor. Standing up, a blonde figure stood in front of them all.

— I have been looking all over for you, Leo. — Erin said.

***

# Chapter 1858: The legendary Blind swordsman. (Part 2)

Rolling off from the platform, there were three in total. Two females, one of them being Erin, and one male. All of them were holding swords. Katana-like blades that were similar to what Leo would use.

— How was I unable to sense them until now? Were they able to suppress it... has Erin finally been able to master how to suppress her aura, even that of the urge inside her. — Leo thought.

For a second, there was hope, but that hope was quickly dashed when he started to use his head more, rather than his heart. For one, there were three of them, if Erin wished to talk, she would have just had a one to one with him.

Sure she had done unforgivable things, but he believed that the relationship between the two of them was strong enough that she could reach out to him. The next fact was that she had appeared here, in front of the vampires, and it could mean that she had to be after them.

Lastly, the biggest thing, and the most hurtful fact, was that the two that were by Erin's side had the same energy as her. They were dhampirs.

— Take the vampires and get them out of here! — Leo ordered taking charge.

The vampire soldier nodded, as he agreed and asked everyone to follow him. It was at that moment that Erin used her large sword, the Demon tier weapon that she had on her, and pointed it toward the group of people.

One of the rings on the sword started to light up, and the next second a large ice tunnel was shot their way. Leo knew the strength of the demon tier weapon well and even though he had evolved, he wasn't sure with his Qi and vampire aura it was enough to stop such an attack.

Instead, looking up, Leo had slashed his blade at the ceiling a few times, and a large chunk of it fell. The ice tunnel hit the giant metal rectangle and had frozen it completely. However, in doing so, it had stopped the tunnel from getting any longer.

— Erin, we don't have to do this, we can talk! — Leo shouted, and charged forward. He had to be on the move. He knew this fight wouldn't, most likely, be stopped by talking, at least not until one of them was beaten.

At the same time, since the ice tunnel skill had been used by the sword, it meant the skill was now on cool down before it could be used again. It was his chance to attack.

While Leo had run forward, jumping over the large ice block that had been created was another female with blonde hair. She landed on her feet and without wasting any time charged forward.

Silver saw this, and threw needles towards the ground in all different areas. As she did, strings were attached to them and had caused small cuts to appear on the back of the girl's leg. Then pulling out her own blade, Silver stood there.

It looked like her attacker had stopped, as she now realized that she was trapped in a web of strings. If she was to move forward, back, or to the side then cuts would appear all over her body, and forcing herself through was a risky move.

— I will get rid of the threats that are harming my people! — Silver shouted, as she threw her sword forward, filled with red aura, making the end bigger and sharper than it surely would have normally been.

As the sword was about to reach her, her eyes started to glow in a bright yellow color. The strings were vibrating due to the energy they could feel from the female.

Using her sword, she spun and sliced at all the strings around her, hitting them at the perfect time and only receiving a small cut along her cheek in the process. After doing a three hundred and sixty degree spin, from above her head she swung down her blade hitting Silver's sword head on.

It was then, that the red aura started to break. Naturally, a dhampir's aura was stronger than a vampires. Her sword was flung back but it was attached with a piece of string, so Silver was able to move it about and swing it so it was now attacking the dhampir from another angle.

— I will not give up just because I know what you are! — Silver shouted as she continued her relentless attack. By now the vampire soldier and the rest of the vampires had escaped, allowing everyone to fight with a peaceful mind.

Standing in front of Chris, was the third dhampir, the male dhampir. Now that the others were gone, Chris had taken off his mask and thrown it on the floor. No longer did he need to hide his identity, because the ones they were looking for were right here.

— You are not a vampire, so I do not wish to hurt you.— The male dhampir claimed.

— Oh, really? — Chris replied. — Do you see that one over there that is fighting? I plan to help him, so do you plan to stop me?

The man seemed hesitant for a while, until he had finally given his answer. — Yes.

The second he had given his answer, Chris was in front of him and had used his large hand to grab the dhampir by his head.

— I'm afraid, I can't let that happen.

Reading on All no vel full. com ,Please!

With Chris touching his opponent, using the third stage of Qi and his Qi control, he summoned it up in his body and into the person he was holding. The next step was easy after that, directing all of his power straight to his head.

Blood dripped from his nose, his ears, and his eyeballs. Dropping him, he fell to the floor and Chris had killed him in seconds.

— I don't want to lose the only person I have now, — Chris stated, as he looked at Leo.

Erin had switched from her large blade to her small katana blade, and began swinging it, releasing yellow lines of aura straight toward Leo. Rather than using his own blood strikes to try and attack, he covered his sword in the second stage of Qi, mixing it with the blood aura as well.

Although the two substances didn't mix well, one could find a sweet spot, a perfect balance to make it far stronger than if one was to use one or the other. Leo had actually learned this from a student of his own.

Leo swung his blade, destroying the slashes of aura coming his way one after another, a strike diagonally, a strike above, a spinning strike taking out two of them at the same time. Inching his way closer and closer.

Every time Leo's sword would hit the yellow aura, it would break it in seconds.

— What has happened to you! — Leo said. — Your power has grown stronger, I can feel it, but now all you're doing is relying on your power and not your skill! It seems like I didn't teach you well enough.

Noticing that her attacks weren't working, it was time for a change of tactics. The sword was placed back in her sheath and the large demon tier weapon was brought out again. One of the rings lit up, and a high pitched shriek was heard coming from the weapon.

Leo could see that his weapon was starting to freeze over. Concentrating, he needed to make sure that his second stage of Qi was strong enough to fight off the Demon tier's power. However, that was only the first part in Erin's attack.

Twisting the hilt, the sword started to emit heat rather than cold. The three rings on the weapon were able to be used again. Her sword was pointed straight towards Leo and was ready to burn him to a crisp.

Knowing what her plan was, Leo threw out a large single strike, a large slash of red aura. However, Erin could see that it wasn't on target and was a desperate move. Due to the freezing of the weapon, it was hard for Leo to aim properly and she knew that, but she knew nothing about his new weapon.

Spitting out from his mouth, a strange red liquid went over his sword, and it began to glow red. The blood in Leo's mouth was human blood, a hidden capsule to pop when he needed it. With the blood weapon activated, Leo could use it to control his strike.

It broke up into several pieces and moved straight towards Erin's blade just before the attack had been activated. It had hit the sword as the fire tunnel was to be fired, but of course, it missed Leo completely and burned the entire floor as it went off the spaceship Park.

— I guess it's time for the teacher to show his pupil why they still need him, — Leo stated.

# Chapter 1859: The Legendary Blind swordsman. (Part 3)

After saying those words, Leo looked like he was ready to kick it up another gear, and that was exactly what he was doing. Swinging his sword several times he created several blood swipes in the air, all headed towards Erin.

The next moment all of them had split, one strike becoming ten smaller ones, and each of them were being controlled by Leo. Independently, Leo was able to control them well as he attacked from different angles in different areas all at once.

Seeing how moving the large blade would make it harder for her to defend herself, Erin changed to her own Katana blade. While doing so, several strikes were coming from one direction. Throwing out her free hand, an invisible strike of Qi came out destroying them and causing them to disintegrate.

This was stage three Qi and Erin was quite skilled at using it. She soon turned to face the next set of attacks that were coming from behind and mid-air, she slashed her sword against a few more, destroying them, but in the end, the attacks that were coming her way were just too many for her to handle.

Several strikes from the side had hit her. They grazed her skin, but using the strong energy that she had from within, she emitted her yellow aura in a similar way that she would have with the second stage of Qi. It caused all of the attacks to just give her a few scratches, but for Erin it was the first time in a long time she had been injured.

The feats that Leo was accomplishing with his sword was something that not just anyone could do. Although Leo's blood weapon allowed him complete blood control of his attack, that was all it did.

Vampires, who had good blood control, could give orders or instructions to their blood to do as they wished. For Leo it was the same, yet at the same time very different. With his ability, and his mind, he was able to know where each of his blood strikes were at any point and time.

Even when breaking up his single blood strike with the sword's ability to create ten more, with his vision, he knew where each one was going to move. He could predict and act accordingly, allowing him, 99 percent of the time, to be successful with his attack.

— Try again! — Leo shouted, as he swung his sword the same amount of times as he did in the air before. Five strikes broke into ten causing fifty strikes that she had to deal with. Erin was doing similar things, moving away, using her third stage of Qi, and her dhampir energy to stop the attacks that were hitting her, but she was still ending up being hit.

— You have gotten worse after leaving me! — Leo shouted. — Didn't my discipline teach you anything? I know exactly what you are thinking. If only I could draw out more energy, then I could get rid of all of these attacks.

— And although that might be true, it is not true for the situation you are in now. You need to do what you can to get out of this bind!

Erin was frustrated, and even more so because Leo was right. She was thinking exactly his thoughts. A lot of the dhampir's strength came from the vampires she was facing. She could tell Leo was strong because her dhampir powers responded.

At the same time, during her time hunting vampires, she realized how much strength a vampire truly had based on how much strength she would get in return. In a way, this always made Erin at least equal when it came to whoever she was fighting.

However, there were more pros to Erin than that. For one, if she was fighting against a vampire as well, although the energy and strength was equal it also truly wasn't, because dhampir energy had an effect on vampire energy. It was like pitting water against fire.

Then there were all the other strengths that Erin had. Her Qi, the demon tier weapons that improved her even if she wasn't using them, and her fighting skills. With all of this, fighting against any vampire no matter how strong they were, she should win.

Which was why she was struggling, the energy she was getting back wasn't that strong, it indicated that Leo wasn't such a strong vampire. Of course, he had great energy but not compared to that of the vampire leaders, not even that of Nico who she had killed.

Yet why was this then proving to be such a difficult fight, that was clearly one sided. She even had the same ability as Leo.

— Since you aren't improving, then let's try something else. Trying the same thing again and again is madness, so I will try something else. — Leo sprinted in with his sword glowing red, and threw out a strike towards her.

Erin had barely managed to block it in time, when the two swords connected though, she could feel her energy was stronger. It gave her confidence. Regardless, she realized that wouldn't matter soon, as attack after attack was coming from Leo, at hard and odd angles, that was making Erin turn and twist herself in odd ways so that she was unable to get stable footing for herself.

Chris was watching everything from the side. He could see that Leo was doing well, incredibly well and better than he thought he would against this apparently big threat. Still, if he needed to, then he would come in and help Leo, so he was ready to jump in at any second.

— Leave him be. — A voice said.

The voice was heard from behind, and it sent shivers all around Chris's body. He didn't want to turn around, because he knew exactly who it was.

— So you followed me after all, — Chris answered.

— Are you going to get involved, because if you do, I'm afraid to say, I'm going to have to stop you.

In the end, Chris couldn't avoid it and had to turn around, and there he could see that Zero was in sight. Seemingly out of nowhere he had appeared, and this time it was in front of Leo as well. Whether Leo knew he was here or not, Chris was unaware, but he didn't want him to distract him from the fight.

— Move away, — Chris said. — You are not getting involved in this.

— Don't worry, I won't be. — Zero replied.

While the two were having their conversation, Silver was also having a tough fight on her own, but in the end, she started to win out. The use of her strings had done her well, and at the same time due to a certain someone, she had gotten better with the sword.

It looked like their battle was soon to come to an end, as the dhampir was on the floor, and Silver stood above her.

— How is Leo doing? — Silver thought.

When she looked up, she could see that Leo was pushing and pushing, and then for the first time a sword strike looked like it was going to hit Erin, but it slowed down, allowing Erin to block in time, and Silver wasn't the only one that noticed.

— Are you... are you not even trying to attack me? — Erin replied, she had done so with such anger that she placed the blade away on her side and took out the demon tier sword once more, striking down with flames being dragged behind the weapon and crashing it into the floor.

— You... why are you doing this! — Erin shouted as she started to swing her sword wildly attacking, as flames followed behind it. Now Leo was on the defensive but it was easy for him to avoid each of the attacks.

— Are you pitying me, you of all people. You don't get to do that. I will take everything away from you, just like you did to me! — Erin screamed at the top of her lungs and ran forward.

Leo lept back, and then the second his feet touched the ground, he leapt to the side, because he knew what she was going to do next.

The ring on the sword started to light up and a tunnel of fire came shooting out from the weapon, but it was twice the size of the last attack. Erin's emotions and powers from her dhampir aura seemed to also affect the demon tier weapon making the attack stronger.

The flame had only missed Leo by a small margin.

— Now... it's time for you to lose something as well. — Erin smiled, as the flames of the tunnel were heading straight towards Silver and it was too quick for her to move out of the way.
