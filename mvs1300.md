# Chapter 1300 - Blood Armour Weakness
When Brock looked over at the six spiked Dalki's corpse on the ground, he believed that Richard had managed to find a way to defeat it, overpowering it by finding some sort of weakness.

The truth was, Richard had done no such thing.

In the middle of the fight, the Dalki had fallen on its own. There had been next to no interference on Richard's end. After his attack had managed to slightly damage its hands, it had started to become more and more aggressive, seemingly having become berserk.

Despite the futility of its actions, it had continued to pound at Eno's strange invisible wall, not holding back its strength. Each attack only ended up creating red ripples of aura. Richard had only been able to pray that given the amount of energy it was exerting that it would tire itself out eventually. Knowing that his lance could at least slightly damage the Dalki he had been waiting for the right moment, yet without any warning, the Dalki had stopped attacking in its tracks, only to fall to the ground.

There was no movement, and with his powerful hearing Richard had been able to tell that its heart had given out. All of this had happened moments before Jim had readied his attack with the shield, giving Richard just enough time to block the attack on Brock's behalf.

"This is what happens, Jim! This is what happens when you force others to go past their limitations! Speeding up the process of their evolution has shortened its life to only a few minutes!" Richard claimed.

Having the same ability, he had an inkling that this had to be the cost of using their ability, not the Dalki. As for what was exactly embedded in Jim's hand to allow him to force those transformations in the first place, that was a different story.

"Too bad, looks like I picked a bad seed. If only he could have lasted a bit longer against you. Oh well, his corpse should provide me with more information after an autopsy." Jim noted, shrugging his shoulders as if he didn't care.

Judging from Jim's words, Richard was figuring out a bit more. It seemed like all the Dalki had a different time limit of how long they would survive after this forced evolution. Perhaps it had to do with a Dalki's innate potential or maybe with their willpower.

If it was meant to be strong, then the exchange, or use of Jim's power might not put too much of a burden on it, while weaker Dalki that would never have amounted to much, would die fairly quickly after he used their ability on them.

Richard also had another theory, that their lifespan might be connected to how quickly they exerted their energy. After all, the Dalki that was still alive, had only performed a couple of attacks, while the one he had faced had been fighting non stop.

"Could it be, you believe that this fact has changed the flow of this fight or something?" Jim asked. "Come on, Richard, you have seen how easy it is to turn one. It should at least give you an idea about what I am capable of."

"Our power is a blessing and I never knew why you limited yourself so much. I used to be proud that you were the King at one point, but if you had only passed down and taught your descendants the proper uses of our ability and what it could do, then what title would have belonged solely to our family!"

"Now you are just being foolish!" Richard snapped back. "Although our power is strong, the sort of power we use, the stronger deals we make, the more that has to be sacrificed. For you to be speaking like this, I don't even want to imagine the crazy things you must have already done."

With the shield covering Jim's front, and the surviving six spike acting as a guard, Richard and Brock didn't dare to make their move. Jim knew this and he enjoyed every single moment of it. Lifting his hand up, a portal had opened up thirty meters above them.

Coming out from it, were two large dropships that would hold around twenty or so masked inside them. The portal soon closed once again, and one of the dropships was seen going in another direction, while the other was heading towards them.

The other dropship appeared to be heading in the direction of the Dragon. At the moment, there were a few loud crashes and explosions coming from that direction, indicating that there was a fight going on, but that had eventually ended.

"I know why you are still confident. You think you know their weakness, and since you have the Blood armour you must be thinking to yourself that all you need to do is to outlast the Dalki, right?"

"Too bad, that I know the weakness of your armour as well. You're limited to only being able to block the attacks you're facing from the front. Playtime is over, let's see you deal with more than just one."

The dropship continued to hover over their heads, and had stopped just behind where Jim was. Seeing this, Brock had decided to throw a Blood swipe towards the ship. He didn't know what it was but it couldn't be anything good. The former Royal Knight couldn't allow Jim to go through with his plan and he knew that Richard wasn't moving because he was afraid the Dalki would attack.

However, the red Blood swipe never reached the ship, for the Dalki leapt in the air, blocking the attack with its body. Neither it nor the ship suffered any damage from it. The next seconds the doors were seen opening, and instead of Masked, three more single spiked Dalki jumped out and landed by Jim's side.

"You should have taken my offer when you had the chance Richard, it was a fair deal." Jim said, shaking his head as he placed his hands on one of the Dalki, his hand lighting up and the transformation process started once again.

Now there was another six spike.

'Two of them should be enough, I'll make this one last a bit longer.' Jim thought, placing his hand on another one. When the transformation was done, it had eventually turned into a five spiked Dalki.

'It looks like Jim has more control over his powers than I thought.' Richard thought. 'This could be worse than I imagined. Perhaps it might be even possible for him to do this on the higher spiked Dalki. I don't even know if six spikes is their limit, or if he's able to increase the strength of those that are already strong. If so… I'm afraid I have no answer. But there has to be a reason why Jim hasn't done it so far! Are their leaders cautious of him?'

"As for the last one, it's always nice to have a backup. Dalki aren't exactly in high supply these days." Jim made a crude joke, which only he found amusing.

There was one thing that Richard was finding strange in all of this, why were they so willing to listen to Jim. He might be their creator, but they didn't strike him as the loyal type. They had their own will and they should be smart enough to have soon that this power boost was a one-way street to their demise.

'Has he found some way to control them?'

Unfortunately, thinking alone did nothing to get Richard out of their miserable situation. Facing one six spiked alone had been tough, facing two would have been extremely difficult and although probably weaker, the five spiked Dalki might actually be the hardest to deal with.

"Brock, I hate it when I am right. It looks like if we want to defend the island, we really do need the help of all the groups. It's a shame, but it looks like they even declined my invitation. Perhaps if they were here, then things would have ended differently." Richard let out a sigh.

"What a strange bunch of last words for an old man." Jim raised his hand as he was ready to order the Dalki to attack, but at that moment, coming in between the two groups, a shadow could be seen in the middle.

A figure started to rise from the centre.

"Quinn! What are you doing here, you stupid fool? If you're here, who is protecting the Dragon?! Do you really want to play the hero that bad-" Richard complained, seeing who it was. However, having turned around and seeing the look on the Cursed faction leader's face, he quietened down.

"Haha, this is great!" Jim laughed. "The leader of the Cursed faction himself has decided to grace us with his presence. You have been an unexpected pain in my plans for too long. Now I'll be able to get rid of two nuisances at once, it's time for you to die, Quinn!"

Quinn's eyes looked at Jim with sadness and pity. He lifted his hand, and held it out before speaking up.

"Jim… for you to have turned out this way, I can't help but blame myself. The one before you right now is not Quinn, but your nephew. I am Vincent Eno, former leader of the tenth family, who you have once sworn loyalty to!"

# Chapter 1301 - The Trigger
The Cursed group that were at the Temple were expecting to face an enemy at some point. They believed that the enemy would come searching after those that had caused them so much trouble, however, at least for now, they could still hear someone, or something, battling with the Dragon.

Most likely the six spike they had seen that had hit the Dragon out of the air. This was why they hadn't expected that each of them would have to be put into action so soon.

Raten was seen coming towards the south gate, he wasn't out of breath or worried but he seemed more annoyed than anything.

"There's too many of them! At first it was fun since they're weak little craps, but their sheer number is proving to be a pain in the arse!" Raten complained loudly as he stood in front of the entrance ready for a fight.

As instructed, Layla readied her bow and Nate jumped down so he could help fight Raten on the ground.

"Hey, so you do realise that since they were all following you that you're technically the one who has led them to this place, right?" Nate glanced at the humanoid beast. In his beast-like form, Raten had seemed a lot more menacing to the vampire, but now that he had taken on a more human-like appearance, he found it easier to talk to him. .

Still, that apparently didn't stop Raten from giving Nate a glance that sent shivers down the other's spine. "How was I meant to know that you guys were still here? What would I have done, if you all had gone in and some of them had managed to discover the teleporter and destroyed it? I was told just to keep the others off your back until you got here. The way I see it, I did my job and now I'm doing even more than usual!"

As the two were arguing, the turret that Logan had placed on top of the Temple roof suddenly moved and fired an energy blast into the jungle. A moan was heard from the forest as it successfully hit someone.

'That turret is impressive, it caught the person, even before I would have been able to.' Layla thought.

Now knowing that the Cursed faction were here, the Masked started to come out in groups. Immediately Layla started to fire her arrows and Raten charged forward with his blades swirling around. He had also left a little surprise for anyone who tried to get past him.

A trail of mud by the entrance. Those that tried to ignore the two frontliners and stepped on the mud remained stuck in place, making them easy pickings for both the turret and Layla.

Seeing the enemy, Layla immediately decided to communicate with the rest that they were under attack. The anti jammer devices were doing their jobs in that small area, so she had no problem conveying that to the rest of the Cursed group already present.

However, it seemed like there was no need for Layla's warning, as the turrets on all sides of the walls had already set off blasting the intruders that were coming their way. The others had also gone into action, apart from two individuals, who remained in the room where the teleporter was currently placed.

"Sam, we have to be careful." Logan warned. "I have hidden those anti jammers in multiple places, but I didn't realise how many people would come to attack us. If we remain here for too long, it's possible that they could find and destroy them. I don't have the means to make another one, which means in the worst case scenario we might end up stuck here on this island."

"I set up five in total and I can tell you when one of them has been destroyed, but my guess is after they discover the first one, they will quickly realise there are more. You will have to make a decision at that point."

It was tough to make, but this was the risk the team was taking by staying behind, Sam just hadn't realised it until faced with the actual situation. His instinctive reaction would have been to call all the Cursed members back now and go through the teleporter, but unfortunately they were still waiting for the Cursed faction leader and right and left hand men, Peter and Vorden…

"I will give the order when the time comes, for now, let's just focus on defending this place and pray they won't find them anytime soon!" Sam suggested as the two of them quickly left the room.

Fex was with Agent 11, who was still being used as a puppet, but at times the two of them also decided to split up. Even then, Agent 11 made sure to not slow down with his attacks. Although he still didn't like having to fight for his captor, he at least understood that the Cursed faction would at least guarantee his life, so he fought just as desperately as the others were.

On the other side, Dennis was holding off strong, and was fighting alongside the beast gorilla that Mona had left with snakey on his neck firing off acid, it seemed like the two of them were faring quite well covering each other's backs. They mostly fought with their fists but they were a powerhouse to be reckoned with.

Lastly, there was Borden who was covering their back side. It was the are that seemed to have the least amount of people, but Borden also still had syringes left to heal himself with.

Layla, rather than just staying at one side of the Temple, made use of their communication channel and would reinforce any side that needed the extra firepower. Since Raten and Nate seemed to be plenty strong on their own, they didn't mind her course of action.

'This is going well, but I can tell that just like last time, eventually the group will tire out. We can hold them off at the beginning but their sheer numbers will overwhelm us. Vorden, Peter, where are you two!' Layla thought.

That was when Layla noticed something else as well. Up till this point, she could hear and feel fighting going off in the distance. It was at the location where the Dragon had fallen, but now it had stopped. She was worried that now the fighting over there had stopped, it would perhaps mean that more forces were now coming towards where they were.

Distracting for only a moment, she soon heard a loud crash and the very building she was on shook. Looking towards the centre, she could see that the Temple walls had been destroyed and there was a certain person who was now lying on the floor.

"Nate!" Layla jumped down and while in the air she started to transform into her third form. Once her bottom half became a snake the first thing she did was use the green fireball to start healing Nate as quickly as possible.

"What happened to you, how did you get hurt this badly?" She asked, seeing that the new armour he wore on his chest had been cracked, she could also sense strong Qi from his body still active, but he was still badly hurt with blood coming out of his mouth.

Nate then pointed towards where he had come from, with the fire doing its job Nate had healed a little allowing him to breathe easier and speak, uttering the words.

"Five spikes."

Turning around, she could see that Raten was now face to face with a five spiked Dalki and because of that, all of the Masked were starting to bypass him and storm the inside.

"They're in the building!" Layla relayed. The first one to appear was surprisingly Logan. He was wearing a suit that Layla hadn't seen before, one that had four spider legs coming from his back. Logan himself was armed with a blaster in each of his hands, yet his extra pairs of hands on his back also had blasters with which he started to fire energy blasts towards the intruders.

At the same time, Logan ordered the turrets on the roof to no longer concentrate on the Masked on the outside, but the ones on the inside.

"Leave all the Masked on the inside to me. I haven't been able to pick my own weight while fighting. The others on the outside are doing a good job, but it looks like that stubborn one might need some of your help." Logan said.

Layla couldn't believe what Logan was saying, how could Raten, a Demon tier beast need her help? If she was to go against a five spike surely she would just get in his way.

"You won't." Nate said, with the flames still on his body. "Layla, we practised remember, we practiced so much. You can do it. just think of the trigger."

'Trigger.' Hearing this word, images started to appear in Layla's mind, images of her mother, images of Pure and the words resounding in her head of what she had done to her, but this still wasn't enough negative emotions for her to transform. She had somewhat come to terms with what her mother had done.

This wasn't the real trigger, the trigger was…

'Cia…I couldn't protect you… you died right in front of me, saving my life! I was always just thinking about myself, you came with me to Pure, and still I was using you. If only… if only I could have saved you.'

The negative emotions had reached their maximum, and consuming them all in, Layla's body started to transform. Her form started to shrink down to the size she once was, the horns on her head grew larger, while her fangs stayed strong with her eyes glowing red.

She had successfully transformed into a true Hannya. Grabbing her sword, she ran forward and struck the five spike Dalki's hand with strength pushing it back.

Raten, seeing this, also went to strike with his two blades thrusting forward.

"You again? You're on my side this time, right?!" Raten questioned her.

"Of course!" Layla answered. "Let's take down a five spike!"

# Chapter 1302 - Broken Jim
When Jim heard that name his whole body froze. The battle that was just about to start between the Dalki and Richard had also suddenly halted all because of one name that had been mentioned.

"Vincent?" Jim uttered, rubbing his eyes and taking another look at the person in front of him. Once he realised that the image in his head and the name that was mentioned didn't match up at all he started to chuckle.

"Hahaha. Should I say I feel honored that you investigated me to this point, Richard? To use my dead nephew's name against me, was that really your big plan? But then shouldn't you at least have made him look similar to him? Do you honestly think after all these years I never found out what happened to him? He's dead, Richard! He died here on this very planet!"

There was a lot of aggression in Jim's voice. While he had still taken the fight against Richard nonchalantly up to this point, he now seemed furious that his ancestor had dared to employ such a god awful ploy against him.

"Although this is indeed not my body I can assure you that I am the very person I claim to be. Maybe this will convince you that I am the one who lifted you from the ground. The very day you were sentenced for trial, I came to see you. At the time, when the guard turned around you grabbed me by the shoulders whispering 'I can't go like this… Please, Vincent, I still have a lot left to show the world. You have to save me. I swear that I was set up by them!' "

Hearing this, Jim's eyes lit up. For the first time he placed his shield down to the side, taking the one in front of him seriously.

'I had learned of what happened between Jim and Vincent through Dwight. He told me the crimes Jim committed and how he was loyal to Vincent during his time as leader.' Quinn thought. 'But I didn't realise that the connection between the two of them was this close.'

The Cursed faction leader was also interested in something else he noticed that was being held in Jim's hand. At the moment Vincent was the one in control, so he couldn't use the Inspect skill on the shield, or the crystals that showed from the top. Quinn wasn't too sure, but it looked like the crystal from the Demon tier crab they had faced.

In the end, Arthur had ended up taking the Demon tier crystal, but since the two of them seemed to be working together, the crystal seemed to have somehow ended up in Jim's hand.

"Vincent… but how is this possible? I looked at your files, heck I even secretly attended your funeral and saw your body!" Jim shouted.

These were facts that even Vincent was unaware of. Since he had ended up transferring his whole soul into the book, he did not know what happened during the time he was in the book himself.

"Ìt's hard to explain and I'm not too sure about the exact details either. It seems to have come as an extension of our ability. I came here because the two of us shared a bond. I had hoped we could speak."

"I know you went looking for me. Edward told me that you left searching for me. I'm sorry that I was gone when you needed me, but I am here now. This whole thing doesn't seem like you. What happened for you to choose this course of action?" Vincent asked, making sure to tread carefully with his words. He could tell just through the limited interaction that the Jim before him was far from the Vampire Knight who used to work for him.

"So all it took for me to see you again was to start a war with the entire human race, huh? Sure why don't we talk about that. Let's talk about how no matter what I do, I end up as the one shafted in this cursed world. As you know, my biggest desire was always to aid vampire society as a whole. To help and get recognised for my accomplishments… but as you know that never came to be."

Jim then lifted his hand and pointed to Richard who was standing behind Vincent.

"Let's first start with him, shall we? I was merely a brat when our 'venerated ancestor' was the Vampire King. I will never forget the day he approached me. He asked me to help him, and as the paragon of his time who all of us strived to become, how could I deny him? Keeping my end of the promise, some time after he entered his eternal slumber, I was the one who woke him up in secret."

"Growing up, I had kept this hidden from everyone, only later learning what kind of sin I had actually committed. At the time I had believed that I had done a good thing. Eventually I became the leader of the tenth family, only for another King to approach me. He asked me to search for a way that we could become like them. The Originals."

"I fell for his sweet words that should I succeed, it would allow all vampires to become like the Originals, ushering in a new golden age for our kind. I gladly spent most of my time in pursuit of that task, but to have a chance I naturally needed some samples. but when I was found out, the king turned against me claiming that it was my own doing, and where was Richard? Where was he to help me? In the end, the only one that ever did help me was you Vincent."

"Did you ever find it strange how quickly they overturned the decision to not force me into eternal slumber? Was there ever a precedent of anyone else having committed a crime as grave as mine who had been pardoned? Do you think I was pardoned because you as the tenth leader vouched for me? No, it was because the King knew he had done wrong. Still, I saw a light, because you turned out to be a person who had helped me, without wanting anything in return."

Quinn had thought it was strange how Richard could have possibly tricked all the others into believing he went into eternal slumber. Was Jim saying he was the one that had woken Richard up, and if so, what reason did Richard have for wanting to wake up? Why go into eternal slumber in the first place?

"Do you understand? I was relied upon, people came to me when they needed something, only to ditch me when it was time, making me a fool for ever trusting them."

"The same thing happened when they asked me to create a blood substitute. I accepted the task, granted I had not too much of a choice on that one, but I succeeded and created the Dalki. However, they were unhappy with the result, so they chose to chuck me and the Dalki to the side to work on their own solution. I was lost Vincent, so I went looking for you, but by that time it was already too late."

"I tried to figure out where it had gone wrong, yet I couldn't come up with an answer. However, I refuse to fail again. This time I decided to force them to accept my solution. The Dalki aren't a failure, they're merely incomplete, something I could have eventually rectified if only the vampires had let me."

"As long as I get rid of every single human in existence with the Dalki, the vampires will have no other choice but to accept them as their solution! If I can fix this mistake, I will be able to fix all the other mistakes of my past. One of them includes waking you up, Richard!"

The reason why Vincent hadn't said anything to intercept Jim was because he had been hoping there would be a way to reason with him without the need for fighting. Unfortunately, the more he spoke the more it became apparent that Jim was already too far gone.

His feelings of rejection had apparently always been there and without Vincent as his anchor they had boiled over, leading the other on a destructive path.

'Jim…does really no part of you see that you're just making another mistake right now?' Vincent wanted to ask, but he knew it would be useless.

"And as for you Vincent. I saw your body… whatever you are, you're not my nephew. Your existence is also something that needs to be fixed." Jim proclaimed, as he glanced towards the six spiked Dalki by his side.

"Vincent, switch!" Quinn shouted, and quickly the two of them changed bodies.

The six and five spiked had moved around Quinn aiming for Richard, while the other six spike had gone directly at Quinn.

It was too fast for him to activate his soul weapon, but luckily Vincent had activated the shadow in the middle of Jim's tirade, aware that the other might choose to attack them at any point.

'A six spiked Dalki punch is going to be strong, but I managed to gather all of those MC cells. I'll block this attack, and attack back!' Quinn thought.

Raising the shadow in front of the fist, and as it collided, in an instant, Quinn could see the system message.

[0/2643 MC cells]

*****

# Chapter 1303 - Can't Hurt The Dalki
After fighting all of the Masked and almost tripling the amount of MC points Quinn had, he was feeling confident in his shadow abilities. He still believed he was a long way off Arthur who had lived for 1000s of years using the Shadow eater as a form of punishment but still believed he was getting closer.

After all, the shadow was almost able to block any attack. Depending on the attack it would decrease by the appropriate amount of MC points based on its power. Which was why Quinn was quite confident going to face whatever Richard and Brock were up against.

Even seeing the six spike, Quinn had remained somewhat unfazed. He had planned to block the first strike with his shadow and then continue from there, but after blocking the first strike, all of his Mc points quickly went down to 0.

'The sheer power from that punch. The six spiked Dalki was even able to go through that?!' Quinn worried.

The strength of the Dalki's punch proved to be stronger than Quinn's shadow, it had slowed down once it had made contact but it was still moving forward aiming towards his body. If he was to get hit by such a thing, he was unsure he could actually survive…

'With no MC points, I'm not sure this will work, or how bad the drawback will be. Maybe it will take more of my total MC cells but it's the only thing I can do!'

[Enhancement soul weapon activated]

Almost instantly, Quinn's body was covered head to toe in shadows giving him a shadow body, and once again he could use his shadow control raising a wall, blocking the Dalki's hit.

'This is bad, this is really bad! Although the Shadow overload skill works, I can feel it digging into my MC cells even worse than usual and if my theory is correct that the cost to be paid equals the amount of shadow being used during the time, it could very well mean I might lose nearly all of of them if I allow this to drag on.'

Right now, Quinn's survival instinct took over. It told him that the best thing for him to do now was to run away and fight another day. Using the Shadow link he could easily head back to the Cursed faction by himself. After all, there wasn't just one six spiked but another as well.

However, when Quinn looked at Jim's face which was all smiles, he thought back, back to what had happened so far.

'No, I can't! I can't! I said I wouldn't return, until I at least pay them back for Wevil's death. I can't leave now when the person who is the cause of this entire mess, is right here in front of me!'

Realising this, Quinn used the full strength he had, draining the gauntlet of every last bit of power he still had left from the Dragon and gathering all of his Qi, he delivered a shadow filled fist of blood hammer. He swung down dragging his whole body back hitting the Dalki right in the stomach. If he couldn;t damage its scales he could at least attempt to damage it internally.

The six spiked Dalki was slightly lifted off its feet, its toes inches off the ground. Seeing this Jim displayed a surprised look.

'This is the first full strength attack I have done since taking the Dragon's energy. Thank god, I didn't use it all up against the Masked. I can tell from my MC points that its punch would be more than devastating… but so was mine.'

Although the Dalki had been hurt, it wasn't something it couldn't take, and he was ready to retaliate by swinging at Quinn's head, but the Vampire Lord was confident his shadow would block it.

Before Quinn's shadow could even block it, the hand was hit by something else, a red lance that was continually spinning. The Dalki's arm looked like it was being sucked up by the rotation, as the scales were ripped to shreds and so was the muscle.

"You did a good job, kid. Together we might be able to come out of this alive." Richard said.

Quinn had heard his footsteps from a while back, so he knew he was on the move. What he didn't expect was to see Brock on his back and the two Dalki chasing after him. Turning around, Quinn cast a wide range of the shadow path skill.

Nearly touching the entire floor. Hitting the Dalki it had slowed them down, but not enough to the point where it was highly noticeable. Their strength and speed was just too much. The two of them were ready for an attack, and it looked like even though Richard had been able to damage one of the arms, it was still in good fighting condition.

Seeing this, Quinn sunk the three of them into the shadows. So they would hit nothing but air, and soon they reappeared where they were originally standing from the shadow again.

"That damned power is so annoying, but I know you can't keep that up, you fake Punisher!" Jim exclaimed. The sound of something else seemed to have caught Jim's attention, and that's when the others could see it as well.

Several of the ships that had first landed on the island were back in the air, only now they had something tied to them. A few seconds later as they hovered higher into the air, the Dragon became visible, either knocked out or so close to death that it was unable to resist being abducted.

Tied up by a strange black string substance, and this was also what was attached to the other ships as well. As they ascended higher into the air, Jim lifted his hand and a giant portal opened up above them .

"It looks like you have ultimately failed to protect the Dragon. They will soon be taking it to the Dalki base. We will use its power to create even more and once we have the other half, I will finally be able to make a complete Dalki." Jim claimed, and at that moment the portal had closed, taking the Demon tier beast away.

The smiles and troubles didn't seem to stop there, as three more Dalki had appeared from the forest. One of them also had spikes and it looked quite wounded, while the other two only had two spikes by their sides.

'They must have been the ones that were fighting the dragon before. I guess a six spike's strength really is strong. Strong enough to take out that Dragon! More and more of them just keep coming.'

Jim could see the despair in their eyes and although they had already been outnumbered, he placed his hands on both of the two spiked Dalki, transforming them into another pair of six spikes.

"I'm afraid that we have utterly failed. I doubt you'll believe me, but I truly am sorry for having dragged you and your friends into this mess. Given your shadow ability, I know that you can escape on your own, so now I am telling you to do so." Richard said. "I know you still had questions that you wished to ask me, and there are still ways for you to find those answers you seek but there is no reason for you to stay here. You need to leave this place now."

They were now five six spiked Dalki, and on top of that a five spike Dalki still alive. Even if the whole Cursed faction was here, Quinn didn't believe they could win. He knew Eno was right, but…

'There is still one thing I need to do before I get out!!' Quinn thought.

The next second his amulet started to light up. The energy from his Marked Dalki that were on the island were now being drained into Quinn. He had the power of three two spiked Dalki and a single one spike inside him. To top that off, the energy he had drained from the Dragon and he was still in his Shadow overload.

"I still have to make Jim pay!" Quinn declared as he threw his hands out creating two large walls of shadow. Blocking out everyone from his view apart from Jim. Immediately Quinn activated his Blue fang armour set.

[Nitro accelerate activated]

Due to the drawback of activating the armour set, Quinn didn't wish to use the skill, but planning to leave right after, he needed to be fast, faster than ever. His extra strength allowed him to only use a single step to arrive by Jim's side.

"I am not that slow either!" The former tenth family leader claimed as he lifted up the shield. He had to admit, he never thought that the young vampire could be this fast or this strong but it didn't matter, for all of that would only work in Jim's favour thanks to his shield. The shield was his back up, in case anything was to go wrong.

Quinn's fist was ready and a shadow filled fist mixed with his red aura spinning like a drill was thrown out hitting the shield directly. At the same time, it started to light up, and Jim couldn't wait to see the foolish boy perish by his own strength.

The blue shield fired off the energy it had contained hitting Quinn, and as it did, his body of shadow started to ripple, breaking up.

"Your life is not even worth Wevil's." A voice was heard from behind, but before Jim could even turn around. He could feel his body had already been pierced, and looking down, a hand covered in shadows could be seen, his heart had already been stabbed and was now no longer beating.

"I can't hurt the Dalki, but I can kill you." Quinn said.

# Chapter 1304 - Destroying The Temple
The five spike known as Slicer had by far been the toughest and strongest being the world had come to know. Everyone had witnessed the female Dalki's strength on live broadcast as it had taken the combined efforts of Quinn and the Blade family to finish her off, and that was after she had fought Hilston Blade, the world's strongest human.

After seeing that display of strength, there were those in the Cursed faction that believed if they ever faced a five spike again, it would be impossible for them to survive to tell the tale.

Hopefully, Raten and Layla could prove that false as the duo were in the midst of facing off against a five spiked Dalki. Her True Hannya form allowed her to produce the special flames, which she immediately used to further boost Raten's strength.

It had all the benefits of her other forms, meaning her speed and strength were currently able to match that of a Vampire Lord, however Layla made sure to refrain from a frontal confrontation, especially since Raten was already going head to head with the Dalki.

The training with Leo and Erin had perfectly illustrated that in front of real experts her swordsmanship skills were still lacking. For the time being, she concentrated completely on supporting her ally, by throwing out the black balls carefully that would summon the spiritual chains on touch.

With her telekinesis ability she was able to move them, guaranteeing that the Dalki would be hit by them, locking it in place for a couple of seconds. This was when Raten, with his newfound power as a humanoid Demon tier beast, could go to work…

As quick as a machine gun, Raten stabbed the Dalki in the chest and stomach while it raised its hands to cover its face. His blades were sharp enough for him to piece the hard scales, leading to green Dalki blood forming a puddle underneath the creature, but not far enough to damage his organs.

However, as soon as the chains disappeared the Dalki was able to fully move again, and when it took its hands down a great smile could be seen on its face. It was getting stronger from drawing out more blood.

"You have gotta be sh*tting me! Don't tell me a five spiked Dalki is stronger than a boosted Demon tier beast!!!" Raten cursed.

Although the five spike had yet to hurt him, Raten quickly experienced the difference between the now injured Dalki and its former self. After having received a power boost from evolving to the next tier, as well as the one Layla provided him with, it was extremely frustrating for him to face an enemy that seemed to be able to just nullify all of that.

Inside the Temple, Logan himself had just received a piece of devastating news.

"Sam, one of them is down!" Logan shouted.

Sam hadn't just been sitting inside. With their defenses breached, he was also fighting all those in the Temple, preventing them from finding out about the teleporter. Up until now, it had looked as if the Masked had just been targeting the Cursed faction members. Unfortunately, receiving news from Logan, he instantly understood that one of them was referring to one of the jammers.

'Should I ask Logan about the location of those jammers? Maybe I could get Borden to try and protect at least one of them to grant us more time?' Sam contemplated.

However, seeing the amount of Masked were numbering in the hundreds from each side, this didn't seem like a good idea. Finding out they were mere clones, told Sam that they would have no care for their life, and if their goal changed to destroying the jammers instead of defeating them, then they would easily be able to achieve it.

"Tell me when we're down to two!" Sam decided to shout back.

It was then, that he could see Dennis, along with the Gorilla and snake had jumped back onto the roof, and now he was fighting from the top of the roof against the Masked. Slamming one of them down into the roof titles punching them with his fist no longer using his shadow abilities or his blood powers.

Now knowing how many of them there were, it looked as if he was preserving his blood powers, only using them if they were absolutely necessary.

'They've been pushed back that far, it looks like we might have to use the teleporter before they even get to the jammers.' Sam was concerned, even more so at the fight that was happening in front. If Raten and Layla didn't figure out a way to take down the Dalki, then there was no one else that could stop them.

Raten and the Dalki were going toe to toe again matching in speed, Layla had attempted to get behind the Dalki, and she successfully breathed a breath of fire towards the Dalki. She also added in her Qi to strengthen it beyond normal flames.

But it seemed to have next to no effect on the Dalki's hard scales. This was a similar problem to what Raten had. From time to time, he would shoot out parts of soft mud from his body, either trapping the Dalkis feet or its joints, but its strength allowed it to break through it, only slowing it down a little.

'Patience, there has to be a chance!' Layla thought, knowing her swordsmanship wasn't up to par, she thought back to the lesson Leo taught her. As long as she knew her strength and her limits with her speed, she could predict when her attacks would hit and whether or not she could avoid a blow in time.

Once again, Raten jumped back and the Dalki chased after him, only to find himself stuck in wet mud, that hardened on the spot, the Dalki was ready to break through it as it had done before, but from the corner of his eye, it could see the girl with the black blade jumping. It was a difficult position for the Dalki to reach.

However, knowing her attacks hadn't hurt it before, it decided not to pay it too much attention and focus on the Demon tier beast that could do it harm.

Layla swung hard with her blade. Up until now she hadn't used it, since she was unable to power it with Qi, only able to rely on her own strength. Hoping for something to happen, the sword hit the Dalki on the neck, yet as expected its hard scales proved too hard for it to cut through, so she immediately widened the distance.

However, from his side, Raten noticed something, a change in the look of the Dalki's eyes.

'Did that sword somehow hurt him? But he's not bleeding? It doesn't look like it's done any damage.'

The Dalki seemed concerned and was ready to turn around and deal with Layla, yet Raten thrust forward piercing the Dalki's hand slightly, at the same time leaving a part of his mud to stiffen the area he had attacked.

'Haha, I'm learning new things all the time with this body as well.' Raten thought with a smile. "Hey girl, keep hitting him with that sword! This lizard doesn't seem to like it!"

Raten started being more aggressive with his attacks and more of them were getting through, as the Dalki was concerned about the strange black sword. Layla could see the strange action in its movements, but she didn't understand why.

Regardless, she decided to go forward attacking at the right time. She was able to successfully hit the Dalki multiple times and she could see more openings than before.

'I see, the Dalki didn't care about me before, it knew I could do no harm so it was able to only focus on Raten, but now it can't decide who to focus on.'

The only thing was, Layla still felt like her attacks were doing nothing, even though she hit the Dalki time and time again, until…

For the first time it leapt back away from the two of them. On its back there were no longer five spikes, but four.

'What?! How can this be? Can this sword also weaken the Dalki?' Layla was flabbergasted. So far, she had discovered that Longblade's gifted sword could negate abilities and Qi, so why could it now also make the Dalki revert back one of its spikes?

Neither one of them had an answer to this strange situation, but both of them saw the chance to turn the tides. The Dalki, also realising it had weakened, felt a sense of fear rise inside of him, and he was ready to turn around, but as he did, a flash and a whip-like sound was heard.

The next second, his body could be seen split in half, falling to the ground.

"How could that thing have given you guys so much trouble?" Peter asked with a smile on his face.

Raten, who was a second too slow, was shaking in anger.

"You…You…you stole my kill!"

Hilston's body had already jumped in and was helping those inside the Temple, and it was the same for Vorden.

Seeing this, Sam had a big grin on his face.

"Everyone, inside the Temple now!" Sam shouted down the receiver, and all of those that were fighting moved into the open area of the Temple, the Masked following behind them. Thankfully, Vorden had a lot of strength, and with his wind powers, for those who continued to chase after them, jumping from the rooftops and were in the air, he was easily able to slice them apart, or push them back far into the wall.

"Alright everyone, it's time for us to head back!" Sam declared.

"Wait! What about Quinn?" Layla asked, looking around.

"Quinn told us that he would meet us on the Cursed ship." Vorden replied.

Layla wanted to ask why he would choose to stay here, but now wasn't the time to risk their chance of escape.

"They've destroyed two more, we have to move now!" Logan hurried the others.

Agreeing to this, the whole group started to run back, towards the room where the teleporter was placed. They threw out their skills, powers and now all the blood abilities they had been saving they cast without worrying.

The Masked were flying through the air and they had no chance stopping this arrow formation of power. Blasting down the walls, the teleporter could be seen in place intact. Logan had activated during their run and it was time for all of them to go through.

"A teleporter! They have another teleporter inside!" One of the Masked cried out.

The first lot of the Cursed group had gone through without looking back.

"What the, why is there a gorilla with us? And why is he going in before me?!" Peter complained.

"Just get in!" Fex screamed, kicking Peter from behind moving him slightly forward.

"A little too late to figure that out! I hope you enjoy the present I left you!" Logan shouted, touching something on his arm as jumped through the teleporter.

Hidden devices all around the teleporter lit up and started to beep several times, flashing red. These devices had also been scattered in the several rooms in the Temple as well. The last person to enter the teleporter was Vorden, and seconds before he did, he heard a loud explosion going off. He turned his head at the sound to see grand explosions blowing off from all areas.

"Your one crazy person, Logan!" Vorden praised him with a smile. "It looks like there is no longer any need to ever come back to that dreaded island!"

# Chapter 1305 - Goodbye
[Instant level up received]

[You are now level 70]

[Stat point has been gained]

[A top tier blood crystal has been rewarded]

'Is that it?' Was Quinn's first thought. However, the system notification served as confirmation that Jim was indeed dead.

During the fight, a figure had popped up in front of Jim that looked identical to Quinn. When attacked with the blast from the shield, it had turned into nothing but shadows, while the real Quinn had managed to sneak behind Jim for a successful attack.

Quinn hadn't known what the shield had been capable of, but in his mind, he only had one chance to attack Jim, so he had looked for a chance to finish it in that one shot. He wouldn't get a second chance after this one, not if his trick was found out.

Before, Quinn had learned of a skill called the Shadow clone. He had already used it once during the fight with General Robin who had been Marked by the Demon tier tree… There was a difference in what Quinn had used this time, though.

The previous version of the Shadow clone had been less complete. The Vampire Lord had only been able to create a shadow of himself and allow it to stay in one place temporarily. There was no way he could control it or imitate it to do actions similar to his own, but he was able to this time.

His shadow had naturally grown stronger under the influence of the Shadow overload skill, and he had unlimited points to create a complete clone. It didn't matter how long it lasted or what actions it needed to do. This was how he had been able to completely trick Jim.

Not only had it worked, but Quinn, using his inspect skill, could see it.

Pulling his hand from his chest, Quinn saw Jim fall to the floor. He was no longer moving, he didn't say anything, and unlike Hilston, he wouldn't have to worry about him having hidden some means to revive.

'Is he really dead?' Vincent asked, not quite sure himself what had just happened. Quinn's quite desperate attempt at making the one who had been responsible for the Dalki's creation and everything that followed after pay for his sins had actually worked.

The leader was dead. Looking at the body, Quinn felt conflicted. There was no real happiness since he had known this wouldn't bring Wevil. If anything, Quinn felt like he had defeated the final boss in a game, only instead of a 'Happy ever after', there was still an army of Dalki left for him to deal with.

Part of Quinn had been longing for everything to be over with Jim's death. Now that the Dalki had the Dragon, couldn't they just let them find a way to extend their life and stop this pointless war?

But at that moment, a message appeared that brought him back to the reality of everything.

[Shadow overload skill has reached its limit]

[Shadow overload will now be deactivated]

[-500 MC Cells]

The drawback was the worst that Quinn had ever seen before, but his total MC cells were still in a better position than when he had first gotten to the island. At the same time, the walls of shadow started to dissipate, his shadow body was disappearing, and now he could see all the others.

The Dalki with the six spikes were all perfectly standing there in place.

'What did killing Jim actually solve?' Quinn thought at that moment. The Dalki were still alive, and they now had one half of the Demon tier Dragon. Arthur was still out there probably plotting or enacting his own revenge, and the war was still going on.

If anything, Quinn had only been able to satisfy his anger a little in vanquishing Jim.

'I at least was able to achieve that. Now it wasn't a complete waste coming here.' Quinn thought.

The Dalki, seeing Jim dead on the floor, almost roared in anger and immediately went on the offensive. Although Quinn no longer had any MC points to use his shadow, his armour set's Nitro accelerate was still active. The first thing Quinn did was pick up the shield lying on the floor by Jim's side and lifted it up.

The Dalki soon stopped its hand before it touched the shield, knowing full well what would happen if it struck.

'As long as I have this shield, it looks like I can protect myself from the Dalki.' Soon though, Quinn could sense and hear that another Dalki was coming from behind. They were smart enough to surround him, looking for a chance to attack.

Each time, Quinn needed to move in place, stopping their attacks by bringing up the shield. He did this repeatedly, but now the two sides seemed to be in a stalemate as Quinn couldn't afford to attack them either, not that he was sure he could injure them without using the shield either.

'This is bad. The six spiked Dalki are fast. When the Nitro accelerate cools off, it takes away that stat points from my Legendary tier armour, which will slow down my speed to even slower than them. When that happens, what do I do then?'

"Boy, I hope you will never stop defying common sense and crushing my expectation!" Richard shouted from the other side. It looked like the Dalki had stopped focusing on him and were now all trying to attack Quinn.

"Soon, your speed will run out. We both know that. I asked you to get out of here before, and you need to do the same now."

Hearing these words, Quinn couldn't believe that Richard was being selfless for once. With the amount of six spiked Dalki there was no chance he or Brock would survive. They would both die in an instant.

The only reason why they were okay now was because the Dalki had deemed Quinn to be the biggest threat, that or they had some semblance of loyalty towards their creator.

'If only I had MC points. I would have been able to put them both in my Shadow lock and then used my Shadow link to travel and get them out of here, but shadow lock still requires me to have MC points.' Quinn thought.

Thinking like that led him to another realisation. The truth was, if he hadn't focused solely on Jim, he could have made use of Shadow overload's duration to save both of them by doing exactly what he had just thought of. It was because of his selfish desire for revenge at that moment that he had missed his chance to save them.

"I know I have made mistakes, I know I might not have treated you well, but I am happy to see how much…one who carries the Eno bloodline has grown. I want to thank Vincent as well, he was a great mind, and it was good working alongside him on the system. It seems that perhaps leaving Earth, the system will be one of my greatest creations because it was able to create someone like you." Richard said.

None of the feelings Quinn had for Richard had been positive, despite or perhaps because of them being related. This made it all the more bizarre that, of all times, he was shedding tears for the man. Was it because he felt guilty? Guilty, that unlike Wevil he had been there to save someone, but had ultimately failed?

On his timer, Quinn could see that the Nitro accelerate skill was near its end. He had no choice. It was time for him to leave.

"Richard, I will save the human race!" Quinn declared there and then.

Placing the Demon tier shield in his dimensional space, Quinn activated his Shadow link. Sinking his body into shadows, and before he knew it, he was appearing by Sam's side.

Part of him had felt that it would have only been proper to witness the fate of Richard Eno, but the logical part of him had accepted the fact that staying there would have just added to the body count.

"Quinn," Sam said. "You made it back."

Looking up, Quinn was happy to see the familiar metal hull of the teleportation room he was in. Even more so, the rest of the Cursed faction looked to have made it off the island alive. Although, from the wounds and blood on their body, it was obvious that it couldn't have been easy for them.

"You guys, this is the teleportation room. What are you still doing here?" Quinn asked, looking around, but his head soon fell on her. A person that stood on the other end of the teleportation room, away from the others alone.

"We only just got here a little while ago, but you see, the reason we haven't left is because of that strange woman that's standing over there." Sam pointed.

On a closer look, it looked like some of them had tried to move, and there was a scorch mark on the ground. Quinn could guess that they had been attacked, but why wasn't she continuing to hurt them, and who could be strong enough to hold this group of people back.

"I see you have a lot of confusion on your face." The female spoke. " I knew you would be coming here and since I didn't want to repeat myself I asked your friends to wait for your arrival, because that is what my prediction stated would happen. My name is Bliss… although from what I saw, Ray has already introduced me to you."

# Chapter 1306 - Strange Powers
While most of the Cursed leaders were on Blade island. The duties of the Cursed ship were temporarily passed on to Megan. She, along with her advisors, decided that the best course of action was to head to the space station and head back to Earth, while asking Nathan for his help.

In the command room, Megan had been trying to get a hold of Nathan, but it seemed difficult. At the same time, it looked like reports from both the Earthborn group and the Graylash group were rarely coming in.

However, thanks to Bonny's usual live feed video, she could see why. The Graylash group were in full combat. Although they couldn't see what was going on with the Earthborn group, judging by the reports that had gotten before, she could just imagine they were in a similar situation.

"Come on, why won't anyone pick up!" Megan said, frustrated. "There has to be someone at the space station. If it carries on like this, we might just have to force them to open it." .

"You could do that, but I'm telling you that there is no need. Even if you got it open, by the time you even got there, it would all be over." A voice said.

"You might be right, but I at least have to-," It was then that Megan realised the voice that had just spoken was one she didn't recognise. When turning around, she could see someone else sitting at the command centre.

It was a female with light blue hair and was wearing strange clothing. It looked as if she was wearing robes. Although they looked to be made of high-quality material, it wasn't what someone wore in this day and age, but the strangest thing that Megan could see was the staff by her side with a crystal at the top.

'Who is this person? I don't remember them being part of the cursed faction, and just how did they get in this room.'

"Don't be startled. I am not here to do any harm. My name is Bliss." She said, thinking that maybe it would have eased the tension of the girl in front of her, but it was clear that she had no reaction, meaning that no one in the cursed faction knew about her. "Oh, it looks like that girl decided to keep my words a secret. Interesting."

"However, as I was saying, it would be useless for you to continue and travel to the space station. You are just wasting your time and worrying over nothing. Right now, there isn't a thing we can do but wait."

Megan was inching closer and closer to the large table in the centre, for some reason, the confidence of this woman in front of her was frightening. Megan was thinking the best course of action was to take action now and ask questions later.

Slamming down on a button on the command centre table, the communication channel was opened up.

"Everyone, there is an intruder in the Command centre. An older middle-aged female with light blue hair. Please come immediately." Megan said, shouting it into the ship's receiver that would soon play the message out to the whole ship.

She didn't want to cause a panic, but judging by the fact that no one else had acted yet, she was wondering if all the others over the edge of the command centre, where the controls were, were dead.

Bliss let out a deep sigh.

"I thought I looked more like a young middle-aged woman, not an older middle-aged one, and here I thought you were a polite girl," Bliss said as she lifted up her staff. The crystal at the top started to shine brighter and brighter until the flash was too strong for Megan to look at.

She could feel a slight heat, and when the heat was gone, she believed it was safe to open her eyes. Looking at where Bliss once stood, she was no longer there. Immediately, Megan ran to the railing and peaked over it, thankfully she could see that all those working at the controls seemed to just be asleep and were now waking up.

'A great flash of light, putting others to sleep, and now she's disappeared. Just what is her ability?'

Thinking that there was a chance that the female who had introduced herself as Bliss could still be on the ship, she headed to the command centre and opened up all the cameras around the ship. While looking at the cameras, she could see a group of the Cursed faction heading her way.

"Don't worry about coming towards me. I am safe for now, but the intruder seems to be somewhere on this ship. You need to keep on looking." Megan ordered while she continued to look around.

At first, Megan wanted the group of people to protect her, to make sure she and the others were safe. Still, if the woman really had the power to put others to sleep, then Megan was wondering why hadn't she put her to sleep. Instead, she had approached her and was talking as if she was giving advice.

Still, an intruder was an intruder.

'That's strange?' Megan thought as she looked at one of the cameras. It was in the classroom where the Blade kids were currently present. Sil was staying with them until he was ready to be called, but she could see he was asleep right now.

At first, it didn't seem like a big deal. He had a right to take a rest before a big fight, but at the same time, before this, Sil was ready and wide awake to go into action at any second after finding out what had happened to the teleporter. To top it off, in the video itself, it looked like the kids were shaking him, trying to wake him up because of the announcement, but nothing was working.

'It couldn't be…'

It was then that Megan could see Bliss on one of the cameras. Of all the places she was in at the moment, it was the particular training room that had been set up, with the teleporter that would bring back those from Blade island.

'How did she get in?'

The door was made from reinforced Glathrium, and it looked to still be shut and locked. This was just in case anyone else happened to appear out of the teleporter instead of those from the Cursed faction. There were now so many questions on Megan's mind. Not only about how she got in, but how she knew about the room and what her aim was.

Soon, she saw Bliss look into the camera smiling and giving a short wave. After it looked as if she started to draw certain things on the ground, but no markings were left behind either.

'What is she doing, and…should I open the door? She hasn't touched the teleporter, and with Sil down, is there even anyone to take care of her.'

Watching her for a little while longer, Megan eventually saw Bliss sitting down and leaning up against the wall. It looked like she was either sleeping or meditating but was doing nothing else. As long as she could keep an eye on her, Megan felt at ease. It felt like this was the easier solution to deal with the problem.

Hours went past, with the Cursed ship continuing to head towards the space station. Bliss continued to stay in the room doing nothing until eventually, she stood up. The portal was seen activating.

"It can't be. Are they returning!" Megan had a smile on her face, but at the same time, she was deeply concerned that the strange woman was still inside. The reason she hadn't acted so far was due to Sil still not waking up. It was clear that the woman was powerful.

The one who had returned first before the others was Mona and with her, she was carrying Linda and the box on her back. When Mona saw the woman, the two looked at each other and didn't say anything. Until Mona decided to step to the side, taking the large box off and placing Linda on the ground.

Eventually, the portal lit up again and coming through the portal one by one was the rest of the Cursed group. They were all surprised to see a stranger greet them. They had expected some type of welcoming party, but what was even weirder was the fact that the second the group tried to move forward, something lit up underneath all of their feet. It was right where Bliss was seen drawing on the ground earlier. When the light stopped, the Cursed faction could no longer move from where they were.

"Right now, you are all bound, but don't worry, I'm not here to harm you, I just don't want to explain myself twice, and it's not long until that person comes here. Now I notice that some of you still have the strength to break the binding." Bliss raised her staff, and strange orange energy left from it. It moved forward, landing right by where Raten's feat was, scorching the ground. "But I advise you not to move, as you can see. I don't plan to harm you."

Seeing the attack nearly hit Raten, he was angered by this, and he was ready to attempt to break out of the binding.

"Don't move. She doesn't want to hurt us, and it looks like she is true to her word otherwise, she would have hurt Linda." Sam said.

Finally, the man she had been waiting for had arrived, and that was the events that had led to their current moments.

Seeing all of the skills and abilities she had used so far, everyone was wondering the same thing, just what ability did this person have. Quinn walked forward ahead of everyone and looked at Bliss.

Judging from what Ray had told him, Quinn had figured out who this person was.

"You said your name is Bliss. You're right. Ray did tell me about you. He didn't exactly speak nicely of you, and I think I can understand why. Now tell me what you want, God." Quinn asked, having no patience or time to be playing games with these upper beings.

*****

# Chapter 1307 - Crossroads
Feeling there was some sort of tension in the room with Quinn and the mystery woman. Sam had suggested that they all get some rest while a few individuals would talk with the new stranger.

Of course, Sam also wanted to find out just what exactly happened to Quinn while he had stayed behind on the island. However, he wasn't hopeful for a lot of information, considering how soon after Quinn was able to leave the place after them.

The group of Cursed individuals selected for this conversation were Layla, Vorden, Peter, Sam, Logan and Fex. The closest individuals to Quinn and the ones who understood the fuller picture of everything going on.

While the rest decided to check on themselves in the medical bay and took the well needed rest, they deserved. Still, there was a question on everyone's mind at the moment. They were sure they had heard Quinn call the strange individual a god.

The group had moved into one of the break rooms, where there was a coffee machine and some snacks for them. It was emptied at this point and time and on one side, all of the Cursed faction were sitting down while Bliss was on the other, having made herself a cup of tea as if she was at home…

She hadn't even asked what weather she could do or not. One thing they were pleased about was she didn't seem like an enemy at least.

"I can see that you know a little about me then, although I'm starting to wonder if all you Talen's have a bad temper. You can stop glaring at me. I'll get to the point and tell you why I'm here." Bliss said.

"As you are aware, I am one of the many gods that belong to the Earth's solar system. I have been living since the beginning of time, and through that, I have been called many things, the Divine being at one point and time."

The others were starting to wonder whether or not they were listening to a crazy person at the moment, but there was one reason they were inclined to listen. On top of Quinn's words calling her a god, they had seen her use multiple abilities or powers. Something only the Blade family could do so far.

"My power allows me to see into the future, I receive set vision in points and time, and since every time I die, I go into one of the human bodies, I have decided to make it my job that you guys survive whatever chaos was meant to get rid of all of you many many times before. Just like in the past, a disaster fell on the world, and my vision saw it collapsing. However, Ray Talen was there to save them, which is why I have come to you, Quinn Talen."

The others looked at each other, wondering if they were all hearing the same thing, and judging by the strange looks they gave each other, it seemed like they were. Still, once again, Quinn was continuing to listen intensely.

"Now, based on my visions, I theorized that there were two points in time where you could change the outcome of the human race. The first one being on Blade island, stopping the Dalki from getting the Dragon.

"In my vision, you failed, and it looks like you have still failed even now. This means you only have one more option to stop the Dalki from winning this war, which is in the vampire world. Stop them from defeating the Dragon there, and you have a chance at winning this thing.

"As for why I have decided to tell you this, even though you should somewhat know this already, is because you are currently at a crossroad, Quinn. I am a little worried that you might not choose the right option, so I have decided to intervene to help guide you to the correct option. Go to the vampire world."

After finishing her long explanation, Bliss drank her cup of tea in front of her and looked as calm as ever.

Following the conversation, Sam figured what the crossroad might be. Right now, the Earthborn group, and Graylash group are fighting with the Dalki, having obtained one half the Dragon, they are likely to make their move in the vampire world any day now.

At the same time, their attack would continue, including the Cursed faction they had yet to touch. Quinn would have to give up protecting the Cursed faction to go to the vampire world and stop them from killing the other half of the Demon tier beast.

When looking at Quinn to see if he had grasped this as well, Sam could just see anger on his face.

"Tell me, if you could see the future, then why didn't you warn us about what was going to happen on Blade island?" Quinn asked. "You're strong. You have powers of a god, so why didn't you join the fight as well?"

Bliss let out a sigh once again as if the question was annoying, and the answer should have been obvious.

"There is a reason why I don't try to intervene too much. I don't know if my visions are based on me intervening in the first place. In the past, trying to fix problems, all my visions came true, but the Talen family had changed that. At the same time, even if I did warn you, would that have stopped you from going? Could you have prepared more?

"Let me give you a guess without using my powers. If you had sent more of the Cursed faction there than you had done, then you would have just brought back more body bags with you."

Quinn was annoyed by her answer, but she was right. He just didn't like the fact that she wasn't really telling him much. She was just giving him options that he already knew about.

"Some god you seem to be. You can see the future but can't act on it. Then you are no different than a Banshee." Quinn said.

Trying to ease the tension between the two, Sam decided to ask his own questions.

"You say you are one of the gods, then are there other gods that are trying to protect Earth at this moment as well, and is there anything else you can tell us. Such as who is alive at this moment or what more we could do?" Sam asked.

"The other gods are mostly dormant. When we die, our powers or our will passes onto another. For example, the god of war might sprout in a young child who is a master on the battlefield, but his memories and such would stay forever dormant. Unfortunately, as time has gone by and we have been needed less and less, their powers and memories have become more dormant. It seems like I am one of the few that is still able to help.

"As for your second question, I can not. I can tell you what you want to ask." Bliss said, looking at Quinn. "I do not know if the man known as Richard Eno or Brock are alive or not. I can't answer questions about this war because I honestly do not know much about it. But what I can tell you is that they no longer appear in my visions after this. Take that as you will."

Bliss answered another questions of Sam, because he even wondered what had happened to Eno and Brock.

After answering this and finishing what was in her cup, Bliss stood up.

"Staying here for a long period of time is bad, so I will take my leave, but who knows. If you succeed in the vampire world, you will see me again." Bliss lifted up her staff, and the crystal started glowing.

"Wait, you just come in here, say all that and just leave. I still have things I need to ask you!" Quinn said, standing up and holding out his hand.

[Skill activated shadow lock]

His skill activated, and the shadow portal was seen opening, but her body wasn't going into the shadow for some reason. A strange barrier of light started to ripple as if it was stopping her body from moving.

"What ability is that?" Layla wondered.

"It is not an ability," Bliss said, winking back. "It's magic." The next second she was gone.

Quinn was beyond annoyed. After Wevil's death, the Cursed faction was hurt, and Richard and Eno went. He had so many questions and no one to answer them, he didn't even have the time to ask Bliss about the sword that Layla had carried. Or whether Jim was really dead.

'Quinn, do not think you have gotten nothing out of this. Remember, in your dimensional space right now, there is one person you can still speak to that knows a bit more. On top of that, we have the Demon shield at our disposal.' Vincent said.

It was true, and Jim was dead, which was news he had yet to tell the others, at least he thought he was.

After the meeting with Bliss, everyone continued to have their rest. They had almost slept for an entire day and a half.

Once the group seemed to be working at close to a hundred percent again, Sam called a meeting for all Cursed leaders.

It was time for them to update everyone on what was happening. Linda still looked a little lost but had attended, and a plan was set for when everyone could say their goodbyes to Wevil. There was no mention of the mysterious woman that had appeared. They decided to avoid any questions since Quinn didn't really get much information from her in the first place.

From Quinn, he was able to give the most information. They had learnt about Jim's death, which was a celebration. Some thought similar to Quinn that perhaps Jim still lived on, especially since he had the ability to clone himself. However, knowing that the Jim Quinn faced could use the equivalent exchange ability, they assumed it was the real one.

On top of that, Quinn had delivered the news that Truedream and some of his men were working with the Dalki as well. The person Vorden was meant to be keeping an eye over ended up dying on his way back to the others from a masked.

Then finally, they learnt of what possibly happened to Eno and Brock, which spurred one person to speak up.

"I do have something," Mona said, who had decided to stay with the Cursed faction. The Bree family had been split up into the three groups anyway, so all her family members were either fighting or on the Cursed planets, so she decided to stay.

"Richard, he told me… he told me where to go if he wasn't to survive this attack. I think he might still have something that can help us."

Hearing this, Quinn wondered just what Eno wanted them to see and what could possibly be at this place. Maybe he could learn more about just what type of person Richard was and his reason for trying so hard to protect the humans in the first place.

# Chapter 1308 - The Dalki Special
With the chaos still going on the other planets, the Cursed group had yet to decide what their next course of action was to be. Sam had debated whether or not he should aid the Graylash faction or the Earthborn group. However, due to nothing happening to the Cursed faction planets yet, and no sign of the five spiked Dalki known as Graham, they had decided not to move out just yet.

On top of this, due to the recent warning that they had received from the all-mighty being called Bliss, Sam was In no rush to leave or go anywhere until they had either more information on the vampire world or the next move the Dalki would make.

However, just like before, when the whole world was watching the Cursed faction face Slicer, everyone was currently waiting for the outcome of the Graylash family.

-----

After receiving the news from Hermes that a five spiked Dalki had been spotted with a large force heading their way, Grim and Owen rushed back as quickly as they could. They were able to charge their feet with lightning allowing them to move at a speed some beast armour wouldn't even allow them to.

They could also move as fast as lightning, but that was only limited to a certain area and took a large amount of energy, so this was the best way to travel.

The good news was that the main planet that Owen and the others were on were filled with dark clouds and would often rain… Today was one of those days.

It gave a boost to the Graylash family, as their lightning attacks dealt more damage to the Dalki below. At the same time, the lightning power was good for both medium-ranged attacks and close range.

It was because of this, the Graylash family were faring better than others when fighting against the Dalki.

And there was one person leading them all while Owen was away.

"Keep up the pressure. Those at the front line, when you reach thirty percent of your MC levels, remember to switch. Head back to the Shelter and recover!" Hermes shouted.

In front of the Shelter, the Graylash family had set up several barriers of walls that they referred to as Bunkers. They had a small gap in the middle where they could fire off their abilities while hiding their bodies. These were often split into groups with not just the Main Graylash branch members, but they also had support type ability users with them by their side as well as other strong far ranged ability users.

Once in a while, the Dalki were able to break through and injure some of them. Still, when Hermes could see that happening, he and an attack force would go out and fight the Dalki that couldn't be dealt with before, with hand to hand combat, and by his side were those that were best at it with their beast weapons and more.

In the meantime, the injured group would receive emergency healing and then head back to the base to swap with another group. Even minor injuries weren't a problem for the Graylash group, that was until the five spiked Dalki appeared, with an army of around three hundred behind him.

"The rest of you stay back. Follow me on my command!" Green Horn ordered, and like well-trained soldiers, the Dalki stood there. Until this point, they had only been small groups of the Dalki. Even though there were around 50 thousand trained fighters in the Shelter, the actual ones with lightning abilities numbered approximately five hundred.

If the whole Dalki force was to charge at once, the Graylash members that were out in the front line bunkers imagined they would lose their lives instantly.

Yet, for some reason, only one Dalki moved forward.

"Fire!" One of the captains ordered, one seeing the Dalki come within range.

Abilities of not just lightning were headed towards the Dalki. Since there was only one Dalki, another order coming from the opposite flank had also ordered an attack.

Around twenty lightning users had fired off their attacks from each Bunker along with other ability users, hitting the five spike.

Greenhorn's body was encased in what looked like a blue flame, even though it was lightning, and only its black figure could be seen. Eventually, when they thought they had done enough, the figure could be seen still standing there.

It hadn't moved, nor had it fallen over like the ones it had attacked in the past. Seeing this, there was one person more nervous than ever. Everything in his gut was telling him that their attack hadn't worked.

"The front line, second line, third line, and fourth line retreat to the castle now!" Hermes shouted, sending out the critical message to them all.

However, it seemed like it was a second too late. Green Horn had leapt up in the air, and on his way down, he readied his fist, swinging it back. As soon as he could see the Bunker he swung out his fist smashing the whole place to pieces. It looked like a small bomb had gone off in the building as parts of the rubble seemed to disintegrate from the sheer power.

When the others could finally see what had happened, the wfrom squad in the Bunker had been wiped out with a single hit.

"It looks like since getting a five spike, my scales have evolved to the point where your lightning doesn't really affect me." Green Horn smiled. "Now, where is that one form earlier?"

The others listened to Hermes' orders and started to leave their bunkers heading for the Shelter. However, it was still a few hundred meters away before they could reach the Shelter walls.

Looking around him and looking at his fist, Green Horn wondered something as he saw the others running away. He started to pull back his fist once more. He then raised up one of his legs like a pitcher getting ready to throw out a ball. Carefully he aimed at a bunker that was around twenty meters away from where he was.

Just like a pitcher, he went and swung his arm out, delivering a punch as hard as he could, and a loud bang was heard. As a shockwave was made, it seemed like energy itself had formed in the air, as a ball of orange coloured energy went out.

The second it had hit the Bunker, an explosion was made, and pieces from the ground were chucked up everywhere, an attack just as strong as one done with his own fist was made, and the second group of the Graylash's had been animated. Even though the Dalki army had yet to make its move.

Bonny and Void were filming far away from the wall. They had their drones out but the weather condition made it harder for others to see. Still, Void's camera had a higher spec allowing him to film it directly.

"I've never seen a Dalki make an attack like that?" Bonny said. She had stopped reporting on the fight like she was doing, since her shock had made her speak on instinct.

Hermes, who was by her side, was gritting his teeth. He wanted to go out there and help them but knew that it would be somewhat useless.

"It seems like every Dalki at the five spike stage is a little unique," Hermes observed. "The ones the Cursed faction fought with, had a sharp strong tail I had never seen before, and now this one can release energy from its hands, allowing it to attack at a far range as well. This means, we have just lost our advantage. Even we on this wall aren't safe right now."

Hermes knew there were still many things they didn't know about the Dalki, how far this attack could go, did he need to wind up like he did earlier, and that's when he realised from the look on Green Horn's face. He didn't know either.

"Hahaha, what is this!" Green Horn smiled. "I just wanted an easy way to deal with them, other than going over there myself. I thought maybe the wind could do the job for me, but the energy left my fists. With this, maybe I can become the next leader!"

Walking forward, it looked like Green Horn was now ignoring the Bunkers. When he was eventually around fifty meters away from the walls, he received attacks from not just Hermes, but the rest of them as well. However, it looked like it did nothing to the five spike.

Green Horn smiled as he continued his wind up, lifting up his leg and pulling back his arm, then in one smooth motion, swinging his arm out while shifting his weight forward, he threw out another orange energy blast.

It was heading straight for the wall, and that's when it was as if the gods themselves were protecting the border. A large blue lightning bolt came striking down out from the sky. Hitting the yellow energy and causing it to fall into the ground, exploding the rocks below, and creating a large crater.

The rocks continued to be thrown with such energy that when they hit the walls, it had created holes and had damaged a few people that were close to the walls in the Shelter. It was proof of just how strong the Dalki's attack was.

As for the one that had saved them, they could see him standing in the deep crater, with half of his white robes torn, showing his masculine chest and frazzled long hair. It looked like the god of thunder himself had crashed down from a meteor, and he did not have a smile on his face.

"I made mistake by letting you get away, but I will make sure not to repeat it!" Owen said.

# Chapter 1309 - Graylash Duo
Inside the Cursed ship, nearly everyone was watching the fight taking place on the Graylash planet. They had, after all, experienced the strength of a five spike. Quinn and a few of the leaders were in one of the break rooms watching the match together.

"Do you think Owen will be able to beat it?" Nate asked.

Quinn hadn't seen Owen fight in a while, but…

"There was one thing I remember Richard said to me. The Graylash family never needed his support. They were always able to figure things out themselves. If he believed in them. There had to be a reason."

——

It was rare for anyone to see Owen with a serious expression on his face. He would often have his fan covering his mouth, but they only needed to see his moon-shaped eyes to know that he was smiling.

Whenever they did see a serious expression on his face, they knew it would be a tale to tell. The last time the Graylash family had witnessed such a thing was when a battle for the next leadership had taken place.

Between Owen's own father and himself.

It was the first time they had also learned he had been hiding his talented skills away from the eyes of the rest of the family. Seeing the serious look once more was giving hope out to the others, including Hermes.

Immediately, Owen placed both of his hands together and activated his soul weapon. Creating the strange orb of lightning he had done from before.

"Haha, you think I'm just going to stand here and let you use the same thing you did last time?" Green Horn shouted. This time rather than winding up his punch, Green Horn just threw out a punch with his full strength, and still, the orange energy could be seen leaving from his fists.

It was smaller than the last one but left his hand just as fast. As long as Green Horn could interrupt what Owen was doing, he thought that would be enough.

The spectators were nervous as they saw this, but Owen still concentrated on creating his soul weapon. Hermes knew he must have had a plan.

The orange energy was getting closer and closer, yet Owen was doing nothing.

"He does have a plan, right?" Bonny asked nervously.

"I hope so", Hermes replied. At this point, he wasn't sure anymore, until once again, a large bolt of lightning came striking down from the clouds above. Smashing the energy blast into the ground, only this time it had gone deeper, causing a rumbling underneath but none of the ground to be destroyed apart from a hole where the Dalki's energy had gone.

Now standing a little ahead of Owen, was a man at least twice the age of Owen, but his body hardly showed it. In fact, the person didn't even look human. If one was to think that Owen was the god of thunder, they would be wrong, for this man was covered head to do with a lightning body.

His whole body was emitting blue light. It looked similar to how the Dalki looked when all the Graylash members had struck it simultaneously.

"Grim Graylash!" Bonny excitedly said. "Grim Graylash has appeared on the field everyone! The ex-leader of the Graylash family and one of the ones who had fought against One Horn in the past with the previous leaders. With the two of them, it looks like the Graylash family have hope to deal with the five spiked Dalki."

Seeing this, Green Horn seemed enraged as he started throwing out punches one after another, each time letting out the small blasts of energy. As they came towards Grim, his natural lightening body tried to electrify them as if he had a barrier around his body.

Although they looked to have done nothing to the energy blasts, others knew that if it was an ordinary person, those simple lightning strikes coming from Grim's body would kill a person.

Still, Grim used his arms to knock the energy blasts away. They simply bounced off his body as if he was hitting balls away. When reaching a certain point in the sky, they dispersed into explosions of energy.

"Fine, I guess I'll just have to hit you myself!" Green Horn said, charging in, and it was at that point that Owen was ready. He threw the lightning ball into the air, and when it reached the clouds, he threw his little fan after it, striking it with a lightning bolt. Soon the cloud started to grow in size, and lightning strikes struck from it.

Immediately, Green Horn was struck by lightning from the clouds. He was unafraid, knowing that the lightning wouldn't hurt him. Or at least he thought it wouldn't. When it touched his skin, he felt no pain. However, he was unable to move his body.

'It still…affects me.'

The realisation was setting in, and Grim was already throwing out a powerful lightning punch towards his head. When it hit, Green Horn was surprised to taste its blood in its mouth.

'How is this old man's lightning powers still hurting me!' Green Horn thought.

"It looks like you haven't noticed. He had already noticed by now." Grim said as he already threw out another punch. Green Horn was fast as well, and although he had been hurt by the punch, it wasn't much.

Even if Grim's punch could hit him before he could hit Grim, he wouldn't take life threatening damage and could finish the old man. However, just before his punch would reach, he was hit by Owen's soul weapon once again, freezing him for a few mini seconds.

"My grandson is special, right!" Grim said, spiralling upwards using his whole body and lightning powers to deliver a punch from below, knocking the Dalki's chin and flinging its head back.

Green Horn felt like his head was going to detach from his body, but with him being more damaged, his energy was rising.

"Everyone, attack!" Green Horn ordered, and the second he said those words. The three hundred Dalki started to run forward.

Hermes, seeing this, immediately retaliated.

"Everyone, we have to support our leaders, make sure they don't disturb the fight. If we beat the five spiked Dalki, we win this fight!"

Before, they might have been hesitant, but seeing how well both Owen and Grim were doing against the Five spike, they immediately started to head towards the battle as quickly as possible. All five hundred of the Graylash ability users were the fastest. They used their powers to enter the battlefield as quickly as possible. The good thing was, as soon as the other Dalki entered the battle, Owen's soul weapon worked in a wide area, so it struck the Dalki, paralysing them, and they were able to use this to their advantage.

"Where are you looking!" Grim said to Green Horn as he struck down, hitting his head again and slamming it to the ground while he was being struck from the clouds above.

The use of two strong soul weapons just seemed like it was too much for Green Horn to handle, but Grim's body was soon fading. For a powerful soul weapon also often meant that its power would also quickly be used up.

Grim now had his regular body and could no longer perform his lightning abilities. Seeing this, and beyond angry from being hurt, Green Horn threw out a punch towards the old man's face, hoping to pay him back tenfold.

Until an almost physical lightning bolt had struck right into the Dalki's forearm. It had gone right through pricing its skin and was visible from the top and bottom of the arm. It looked like the lightning bolt had the same effect as Owen's soul weapon.

"I will leave the rest to you", Grim said, as he ran past Green Horn to join the others in their fight. Although he didn't have Mc points left, he could still fight well with his bare hands.

Looking at why the old man suddenly left, he could see Owen standing in front of him, with a physical lightning bolt held in his hands. It looked to be a condensed solid form of lightning, in the shape of lightning itself.

"You Dalki seem to be growing more spikes every time I see you, and I am not a fool to think that it wouldn't have happened to you, but just like you, we can also evolve with our powers."

The Dalki ran forward, but the lightning bolt came out again, this time sticking through the Dalki's thigh. Paralysing the muscles in that area for a second. Green Horn tried to carry on moving but only tumbled, falling to the ground.

Before he could even move again, Graylash formed another lightning bolt, throwing it in another part of its body and doing the same thing repeatedly. The physical lightning bolts not only could pierce the Dalki's hard scale skin, but it also seemed to have the same applied effect as his soul weapon and were as fast as them as well.

Eventually, Green Horn was stuck in the ground with over thirty physical lightning bolts stuck in his body.

"It looks like you didn't evolve enough this time, and I grew quicker than you", Owen said, and the usual smile on his face appeared again. The clouds above were no longer blacks and the lightning orb he had initially thrown into the clouds began falling ever so slowly like a snowflake.

While the battle was going on, no one seemed to be aware until the orb finally dropped on the Green Horn, and all the lightning bolts lit up simultaneously. A defining bang resonated through the whole field. It was a single loud shock and a flash.

Almost blinding anyone looking directly at it, but if they were to look at the spot where the Dalki once was, there was nothing there but the scorched ground.

Witnessing this on camera, people worldwide cheered as they saw the Graylash family achieve a victory over the five spikes. This was twice now that the world knew they had obtained a victory over their strongest.

Quinn, watching it, was left in awe.

'Owen, it looks like you also have been trying your best to get stronger and stronger this whole time, and…you really have done. I'm not the only one that's in this fight. I'm not the only one fighting for the human race.' Quinn thought when seeing this.

However, another thought entered his mind, as there was something the world didn't know. At the moment, the Dalki had obtained one half of the Demon tier dragon used to create them. Before, when defeating the Dalki, with each kill, it felt like they were almost accomplishing their goal little by little, getting rid of them, but now…

Did it matter that they had killed a five spiked Dalki, because who knew how long it would take them before they created more?

'I need to stop them from getting the other half.'

# Chapter 1310 - Hesitation
After the defeat of the five spiked Dalki, the Graylash group managed to fend off the remaining Dalki army that was advancing towards them. It was a complete victory for the Graylash group. Of course, they had their losses, but the Dalki was unable to set foot in the Shelter, which was a hopeful sign for the rest of the world.

However, their duties weren't over yet. There were still plenty of Dalki motherships occupying the rest of the Graylash planets. The other two planets that the rest of the Graylash faction were on were still in the middle of their battles.

Still, the Cursed faction was in high spirits, and everyone was in a good mood, apart from those who knew the reality of the situation they were currently going against. The Cursed leaders decided that there was no need to reveal that. Not while everyone was still fighting and for once seemed to be carrying the momentum. In war, it was a strong thing to have the motivation and momentum on one's side.

Currently, Quinn had been patiently waiting for news in the vampire world of what was going on, but Paul, Leo, nor Erin had given them a reply. It was worrying, but certain things kept Quinn from bursting through the teleporter and heading over to the other side.

One was the order that Quinn had received, that he was not to return to the vampire world. He didn't want to cause trouble for his family if he didn't have to. The second reason was that Quinn could tell from the connections that they were safe.

'Damn that Bliss girl, her words are messing with my head, and now I can't choose whether to stay or go. I think she just made things worse.' Quinn thought, who was currently in his own personal training room.

Rather than thinking about what he couldn't do, Quinn decided to think about what he could do for now. First, he was to figure out what exactly he would do with the items from blade island. In his dimensional space at the moment, he had a tablet.

Not just any tablet, but the tablet that held his long last ancestor that used to be a dragon and one that held all the abilities of the world.

'Unlike the shadow lock, I can't enter my dimensional space. So there is no way for me to try and communicate with Ray again and try to get some answers from him. I could place it somewhere, but where? Should I place it somewhere on earth, or maybe somewhere on the Cursed ship.'

Thinking about it, Quinn imagined the tablet on the Cursed ship. There wasn't exactly a good place for it, and he didn't think it was safe on the ship nor any of the planets, and that included earth.

'I guess I don't desperately need to ask Ray questions, so for now, the safest place is for it to stay in my dimensional space. I just hope it doesn't affect the cycle of abilities he was talking about either.'

There was one more item that was in Quinn's dimensional space that he could take out, and he did so, bringing out the Demon tier shield. Quinn held it in his hands and used his inspect skill.

His guess was right. The Demon tier shield had been made using the Demon tier crystal that Arthur had taken from him. It was the confirmation that Arthur and Jim were working together. Even though Quinn was already a hundred percent sure.

Looking at the active skill, it was strong. It was able to reflect any damage taken on the shield itself and repel it back at twice the strength. Now he understood why the Dalki were so afraid to hit it.

Still holding the shield, Quinn closed his eyes and opened them again. He imagined his opponents and how he would use the shield while fighting, blocking certain attacks and using his Gauntlet to attack.

'It feels so unnatural and even more so than the sword. Besides, I already gave the blood crystal to Alex to work on.'

Taking on board Vincent's suggestion, Quinn decided to use the crystal he had received from Jim's body to create another gauntlet. Unlike with beast crystals, blood weapons could be formed into anything, so Quinn didn't have to worry.

At the moment, Alex was with Andrew at the Earthborn base, helping them craft weapons for support, but with his shadow link skill, Quinn was easily able to go there and ask for this request.

'Well, if the Shield doesn't suit me, then I guess it means one of the others can use it, but who?' Quinn started to wonder.

There were many candidates, and of course, Quinn wanted to give it to one of the leaders close to him, preferably someone who had recently gone to the island with them. They were those that were already plenty strong and that it didn't suit. But finally, Quinn had made his decision.

Heading to one of the training rooms, not too far from his own, he saw the person he was looking for doing a good job teaching the rest of the Cursed faction.

"Hey Nate, it looks like you recovered well. I heard you got blasted by a five Spiked Dalki." Quinn said in an upbeat tone.

"Ah, I would have to have a monster amount of Qi like Layla to be able to block a hit like that," Nate said, a little annoyed. With his skills, he felt like he just needed something a bit more to push him further.

What he didn't know was that Quinn had a gift ready for him that would do just that. Taking it out from his dimensional space, Quinn had a shield in his hand and handed it over.

"This is yours, take it."

Nate looked at the shield oddly at first. He didn't use weapons and only used his fist, but a shield was quite versatile in its use, and there were certainly ways he could learn to use it. However, the second Nate touched it and activated the beast weapon. He could feel the immense power in the shield itself, powering him up.

The defensive and natural stats he gained from it were amazing. He could tell his body had improved just on that alone. Even before Quinn had told him what the active skill was, he was pleased.

"Quinn seriously, I can't believe it. Ever since the day I met you, I thought that if I were around you, big things were going to happen. I had grand ambition, but lately, I felt like I had hit some type of stalemate. I thought I could improve myself, and I disliked using beast weapons, but I realize now that I was stubborn.

"Because this thing is too good to pass up. I won't be stubborn. I will accept this gift, Quinn!" Nate said, thanking Quinn over again and again. Eventually, Quinn had to threaten to take the shield away if Nate didn't stop thanking him.

When leaving the room, Quinn had a big smile on his face. He wished he could make more people just as happy as that.

On his way out, he had unexpectedly bumped into someone else who was looking for him, Fex.

"Quinn, do you have the time to talk?" Fex asked.

The look on his face looked quite serious, and Quinn always had time for his blood brother. Walking together around the ship, Fex expressed what was on his mind.

"Quinn, I know you're waiting for a reply from the vampire world on what to do, and it's why you haven't decided to go to the Cursed faction planets or the place Mona mentioned, but I think you should just go with Mona."

Quinn was quite surprised at how upfront Fex was being and was interested to know the reason.

"I have a suggestion to make. I want to go to the vampire world. Technically I am in the tenth family, but the order was only for you not to return Quinn, and I'm worried, I'm concerned about my family in all of this.

"If I go, I thought maybe we could take one of the Cursed with me. Linda seems to have a lot on her mind recently, and maybe a change of scenery would be better for her. Then if anything was to happen and we needed your help, you could come to us. Bryce doesn't know who in the Cursed faction has the shadow ability, so as long as she doesn't use it, she won't get found out.

"This way, you can head to Eno's place with Mona, without any worry. It's better than you sitting here. After what you told us, I kept thinking that maybe Eno knew something, maybe he knew more. I think we, no I think you need to head to Eno's place as soon as possible, and stop worrying about the others. All this hesitation is just making things worse."

Fex quickly wanted to apologize, thinking that he might have overstepped his position, but Quinn replied sooner than he thought.

"You're right, Fex. You're very right. I think your suggestion is a good one. I'll head to Eno's place, and you guys can head to the vampire world."

# Chapter 1311 - No Longer Needed
Losing Green Horn was a significant loss to the Dalki. After all, it was one of their leaders and one of the ones that were growing quicker than the others. They had the potential to grow even stronger and were rare among the Dalki. Losing Slicer and Green Horn so quickly was not in their plan.

However, despite this, Graham smiled as he looked out from the strange mountain like a castle on the planet like ship they resided on. He could see what they had achieved at that cost. The great Dragon was being flown in towards the castle.

It was still being restrained by the strange black strings, but it looked like it had no energy to fight back in the first place. Eventually, the ships ended up going to a large facility that was at the base of the strange castle.

The facility was large in size, and there was one large building in particular that was the size of a football field. As they got close, the giant metallic doors were seen splitting open. Large volumes of green liquid were floating inside. Similar to what Graham had kept the Dalki in.

The ships slowly decided to place the Dragon in the strange liquid carefully. When dropped in, the doors started to shut again, keeping the Dragon in place.

With a leap, Graham had jumped from the top of the castle down to the facility. Landing, he caused a big bang, but the ground didn't break. The ground where the facility and the Dalki castle were on was taken from a planet with a substance known to be as hard as diamond.

Not that the Dalki were unable to break it, but it at least limited the amount of damage an area would receive. Especially since there would be conflicts just outside the castle more often than not. This was due to other Dalki challenging for the leader's seat.

Entering the facility, the doors automatically opened as Graham walked past. Inside, there weren't other Dalki working away, but Humans instead. They didn't look like fighters as they had no beast gear on, only lab coats, and someone else looked familiar in the facility as Graham walked around.

The clones of Jim Eno. They were maintaining the place, looking at computer terminals running tests on Dalki and different solutions. Eventually, Graham had reached the landing room where the other ships had docked away from the Dragon.

Straight away, he could see a few Dalki leaving from the ship, and with them, they were dragging a pair of Dalki along the floor and on their back they had six spikes.

"Unfortunately, they died on the way here." One of the three spiked Dalki reported. "I know you said it was best if we kept them alive, but the Dragon seemed to be stronger than we thought."

Graham bent down and looked at the pair of six spikes. They were covered in wounds, but they didn't look bad enough for them to die from.

"We are strong, so I at least expect our ancestor to be this strong. It would be strange if it was easy for us to overpower it with just one of us, even if it's only at half its strength. You guys did a good job."

It was then from another ship that Graham could see the Dalki pulling out someone else, someone he didn't expect to see.

Walking over, he looked at the person just to make sure, and seeing that he had a specific pair of beast crystals embedded into his hands, Graham knew this was the real one.

"You often acted like you knew how everything was going to play out, but it seems like something exceeded even outside your expectations," Graham said, lifting up the body, throwing it over his shoulder.

"I want a full report of what happened on that island, how many of them there were and who else was there. Also, bring those two with you." Graham ordered leaving the room.

Eventually, he had reached a lab of sorts with hundreds of large human-sized glass containers. At the front of two large terminals were glass containers bigger than the others that remained empty.

Typing a few things in the terminal, a large claw machine grabbed Jim's body and placed it into the container. Its body strapped and floating inside.

'It was a good thing your mind wasn't damaged. At least it looks that way." Graham said as he pushed down on a leaver.

Both of the Crystals inside of Jim's hands started to light up. The energy levels in front of Graham's screen started to rise up, and something could be seen forming in the other container. Small particles could be seen gathering making a circle.

Then the circle started to shift and change as more blobs were forming until someone who looked identical to Jim was made. It opened its eyes, and the claw machine once again pulled out Jim, only this time from the other container.

The claw machine soon let him go, dropping him to the ground, and with how wrinkled his forehead looked, he was beyond angry.

"Damn it, that Cursed faction, that kid killed me! He killed the real me!" Jim continued to shout.

"If he had gone for your head, I would not have been able to make you again. I think that we should be pleased with the result. We have obtained the Dragon." Graham replied.

"Do you not understand!" Jim said, rushing forward. "My body is dead. My real body is dead!"

"Weren't you looking for a way to create a perfect body anyway?" Graham replied like he really didn't care. Hearing this, Jim turned around, throwing out his arm in a claw shape, going for an attack, but the second he did, Graham grabbed him by the neck and lifted him up in the air. Holding him just tight enough so he couldn't speak and was struggling for air.

"Did you really forget? You just said it yourself, you are no longer in your body anymore. There is no way for you to use your abilities like before. Even the clones you create with your Nest Crystals are not perfect, so right now, you are useless to us." Graham said.

Jim started to move his leg and arms in a way as if he wanted to say something, desperately struggling. Listening, Graham let go but grabbed him by the top of his head before he could touch the ground.

"Remember, I was the one that created you. You guys need my knowledge to create more of you from that Dragon, and when we have the whole Dragon, I can fix all of you! You can live forever, just like the originals can!" Jim said with a smile on his face. "This body might not be able to learn the ability again, but all my knowledge is still up here."

Graham looked at Jim for a second as if he was still in the middle of making up his mind.

"Jim, did you ever think that I might have surpassed you. I have created a solution that naturally aids us in our own evolution. There is no ability behind that. Our lives don't shrivel down to a mere ten minutes just because you made us six spikes. Or maybe you never stopped to think about that."

"I see the way you look at us, Jim," Graham replied. "You are the worst person I have met by far. You were never doing this for us in the first place. You were just doing this to prove something to them. We are just tools to you.

"Don't worry, as long as I have your real body and your brain. We will figure something out, and I will be happy to bring you back once again when I need to, but for now, I won't let you go about freely doing whatever you want again. See you later, Jim.' Graham said, as squeezed his giant hand, and Jim's head exploded on the spot."

Graham didn't look back, leaving his body in place and exited from the room, while Jim's real dead body continued to float in the other container. No signs of life, and perhaps his mind would never be woken in another body again.

"A Dalki should be the one to lead the Dalki, and we will come out superior to the others. We do not need to rely on a vampire for our troubles. Let's see what we can do with this Dragon."

# Chapter 1312 - Is Fate Real?
After their little talk, Quinn decided that Fex was right and it was time for them to act. The only problem was, without any reply from Leo and the others, it also meant that the Cursed group could not use the secret way to the Vampire World like before. Right now, they were all in the middle of another discussion to decide what to do about that.

"Linda, are you absolutely sure you're okay heading to the Vampire World with Fex?" Sam asked, having noticed the heavy bags under her eyes. The last time the group had seen her in such a miserable state had been when her brother Blip had died.

"Yes I am. Wevil gave his life to protect me and the Cursed faction, so I can't just stay here and mope around. He wouldn't have wanted that. I still want to help where I can and I think I'm still the best candidate to keep their head on and not use the Shadow ability in front of others, even in a desperate situation." Linda stated.

Sam started to nod, but the others were wondering what she exactly meant by those words. Among the Cursed faction members, apart from Wevil who had passed, those that could use the Shadow ability were Sam, Nate, Dennis and Alex who was away at the moment.

"Right now, with what's going on, maybe we don't need the strongest person but the most sensible one." Layla explained to the guys who looked confused. "No offense, but you guys can be a bit too… hot headed?"

Sam was happy that Layla had been the one to say these words. At least coming from her it had still been nice. Putting it more simply, the other three could be described as musclebrained idiots.

"Unfortunately, that still doesn't solve our main problem. We haven't received a reply from Paul yet and we need him to activate the teleporter in the tenth castle to let you guys in. We'll have no choice but to wait… unless you happen to have a solution, Logan?" Sam asked the inventor.

"We could always try the teleporter we originally used to travel to the Vampire World." Logan suggested. "It doesn't seem to have been destroyed, so it's still active, but I can't say for sure they haven't found out about it. For all we know, they might have placed a bunch of guards around it, waiting for us to use it. There is also the situation of what state it was left in last time."

"We'll do it." Fex stated immediately. "As long as I am the first one to come out, it should be fine. I'll find a way to explain myself out of the situation somehow. While we are there we can also try and locate the Dragon. It's not too far from the lab, and that's our main worry, right?"

Logan seemed to have predicted Fex's answer, as he pulled out three bottles of spray and slid them across the table to the vampire.

"These are for your toy. You did plan to bring him along, right? Or have you decided to turn him perhaps?" Logan asked. He was naturally referring to Agent 11, who had proven useful and had returned with them on the Cursed ship.

"No, he seems more useful as a human than a vampire. I can use his blood for my string abilities as well as my blood weapon, and having someone who can use Qi might prove useful if he have to fight any vampires."

"Besides, I have a feeling that turning him would not make him spill any of his secrets. Whatever mind block he has, or perhaps they have used an ability on him, but there is a chance that it will still block out our direct control even then."

Now that the others knew that Truedream was working for the other side, they knew that they also had strong ability users that had been gathered under his name, including Jack Truedream himself.

"Alright. Quinn, you're happy with just having Mona and Logan accompany you to Eno's base? We have the coordinates, and it looks like the ride there will take a few days, the place is pretty far." Sam asked for confirmation.

"If it's just the two of them, then I'm confident in my ability to protect them. I can always use my Shadow lock and Shadow link out of there, if this turns out to be some sort of trap." As soon as Quinn said these words, he was reminded of a certain person that had managed to block his Shadow lock for the first time, which made him lose confidence a little, but realised that there would be no reason for the skill not to work on his fellow teammates.

Mona had her own reasons for wanting to go and see the base. In the first place, she had been the one who Richard had for some reason entrusted with this information, so Quinn felt like it would be unfair of him to exclude her. She had also massively helped them out on Blade island, and without her ability having tamed the Kraken, another life might have been lost among the Cursed group.

Since Richard was a great mind, there was a good chance that there would be plenty of information they could gather, and with Jim and Richard possibly dead, Logan wanted confirmation that Jim was the one that had decided to kill his parents.

Even if Richard said it was Jim, words alone just weren't enough to satisfy Logan's curiosity.

"Then it's settled, before you all set off I would like a word with Mona." Sam said.

Quinn went off with Fex and Logan, who was setting up the teleporter, making sure everything was as safe as it could be on their side. Quinn wanted to at least see them off before they left, as he was a little worried about Linda. It was an odd pairing, Linda had mostly always been with Wevil, and now she would be partnered up with someone who was a bit extra at times.

Mona, had done as she was told and stayed behind as the others left the room, she thought that maybe Sam had some questions about her ability or information she had seen. Since their return, Sam had been writing up reports and taking recordings of each of the members' encounters they had on the island.

It had helped build a bigger picture of what the situation was like, and if anything ever happened to them, they could pass this on.

"Mona, I hope you don't act rashly to what I'm about to ask you, and I told the others to go away because I want you to know that I'm not suspecting you of anything…"

Hearing this, Mona started to pull a face because this was not the tone or the conversation she had been expecting to have.

"You see, I looked back at the video in the recording room, and when speaking to Megan she told me something interesting. You arrived before everyone else that day and had met up with Bliss. The two of you said nothing, despite her being a person who should not have had any clearance to be there at that point in time. Instead, you simply decided to sit by the side."

"You…You met Bliss before, haven't you?" Sam asked, preparing himself for her to attack him at any moment, for revealing her secret or finding something out about her.

"Do I really look that scary to you?" Mona sighed and put up her hands as a sign of good faith that she wasn't going to do anything. "Well of all the people to find out, I guess it's good that it was you. To answer your question, yes, I have indeed met Bliss before. The person who Quinn called a god."

"And that's why I want to go and see what Richard left behind. When he saved my life, he took me to a place. I don't know where that place was, but I wasn't the only one there. While I was there, that was where I met Bliss."

"You were there when she had the conversation with Quinn. I imagined she said something along these lines, that she was able to see what would happen in the future. Now I wasn't involved in the rest of the conversation between the two of them, and it seemed like she and Richard had met more than once. To me, they seemed like old acquaintances."

"But you tell me, if what she said was true. Then did Bliss tell Richard what was going to happen on the island? The way he acted when he told me these coordinates, Sam, it was as if he knew he was going to die, and he still decided to go to Blade Island!"

"Before, I would have never believed that whatever happened was meant to happen, but if that's the case can we really change what is meant to happen to us? From the little I've known Richard, I don't believe he was a man that didn't think he could change things, otherwise he wouldn't have tried so hard for so long."

"So there has to be something there waiting for us!"

*****

# Chapter 1313 - Eno's Surprise
At the moment, Quinn along with Mona and Logan, were riding together in a spaceship, and it was only the three of them. No one else had been brought along just because of the fear that more dangers for the Cursed faction and other groups could be lurking around the corner.

During this time, Mona had left with a lot on her mind and was busy sitting at the table staring off deep into space. In fact, all three of them were busy thinking about things.

Space travel was quite advanced, and the power of beast crystals allowed one to travel at a fast speed. For something to take three days to get to, it was similar to having one person go from one planet in the beast solar system, all the way around the sun, and back again. Which was why they had plenty of time to think about things.

The ship they were travelling in was one that Logan had personally modified himself. Giving it a more aerodynamic design, but the inside was quite comfortable. It almost looked like a studio apartment with how nicely finished the inside was. There was even a workbench for Logan to work away as he wished on.

For Quinn, he was sitting at the dining table as well and grabbed the Demon tier amulet that he still had around his neck.

'I used up all four of the Dalki, draining them again.' Because of this, it ultimately meant the Amulet was useless since it didn't give any stats, and Quinn would have to gain slots for the Amulet all over again.

The problem was, what could he do with it at the moment that would help him? If he was going to go to the vampire world, would it be any help there? Quinn wasn't quite sure if vampires even could be marked in the first place, and even if he was to use it on the weaker ones, they wouldn't exactly help him out much.

The Dalki were able to evolve, and with each evolution, he gained a considerable amount of energy. Vampires could evolve, but the evolution couldn't be forced through battle like with the Dalki.

While trying to figure out what to do with it, Quinn had done something even he hadn't expected as he looked at Mona, who was sitting opposite him.

Giving it a tug, the Demon tier amulet chain broke. He placed it on the table, moving it over to Mona.

"Mona, you helped us out a lot on Blade island back there. You even brought Linda back, so I thought maybe you could do with this." Quinn said.

Looking at the Amulet and picking it up, she could instantly tell the item's level, and she was at a loss for words.

"Quinn, have you gone crazy?" She asked. "I know I have been helping out the Cursed faction, but I ultimately plan to bring back the Bree family at some point. If you give this to me and people found out…"

"What would they think?" Quinn asked. "That I'm just helping out someone that is helping me? Or were you going to say that I was favouring another faction? Tipping the scales of balance, or my own faction would be annoyed at me.

"Look, I don't see things that way. Maybe it's because all of these groups tried to hold power for themselves rather than share it with who was best to use them. We ended up in this situation in the first place. I keep thinking if the humans actually worked together. Instead of the originals keeping their abilities and such, maybe we could have had a better chance in the first war. Besides, it's still mine." Quinn smiled.

"Think of it as borrowing the item. That Amulet will suit you well, and when I need it back, I think you will realise that really you were doing me a favour."

Mona still couldn't quite believe that Quinn had just given her a Demon tier item of all things. It would have been unheard of from any of the leaders or the military to do something like this in the past, and yet Quinn had just done it on a whim while travelling on the ship.

'This boy…really is different from the others.' Mona thought.

After accepting the item, Quinn went into the details of explaining what it could do, rather than letting her figure out how to use it herself. She understood how much of an amazing item it was, and also had learnt how Quinn was able to take down the other Dalki mother ships.

However, she also understood why it would still benefit Quinn when he gave it back to him.

Quinn was often in tough situations, so he had to often drain those that he had marked, but after visiting Richard's place. If she went at her pace, she could gather many Marked essentially on behalf of Quinn, and when he needed it, he could use all of their power.

As long as Mona didn't use it, of course.

Although she didn't say it, just because of Quinn's gesture, she vowed that she would try to collect as many Marked as she could possible for him. Unless absolutely necessary, she wouldn't use the power, giving him the Amulet in the future.

During the rest of the time spent on the ship, Logan was tinkering with a few new gadgets of his, but once in a while, they would hear Logan fumble or mess up. With how often he was making mistakes, Quinn could tell he had something on his mind as well.

The only problem was, Quinn couldn't help with Logan's problem, but hopefully, wherever they were going and whatever they would find, Logan could find the answer to what was troubling him.

Not wasting time, Quinn was trying to focus on something else. His Qi still was vastly greater than the blood aura he had in his body at the moment. He had learnt to control himself so he could better use one or the other in certain situations. If he was going to the vampire world and possibly was having to go against Arthur, there was one thing Quinn needed to learn.

'The third stage of Qi. This is what Lucy and agent 2 were able to use against my shadow. My shadow was useless at blocking it. If I have to go up against Arthur again, this is what I can use against his shadow.' Quinn thought.

During the next couple of days, Quinn was trying his best on figuring it out. He had asked for pointers from Layla before leaving, but it turns out she wasn't the best of teachers either, only able to explain things as clearly as Fex could.

Eventually, the two days passed, and the group were wondering just where they were.

"It certainly is strange. We are now in unmarked space at the moment." Logan said. It meant that the group was currently in an area that humanity had yet to explore in the beast solar system. However, that was because they deemed there were no other planets in the nearby area.

They would have to travel as far as another solar system to find any planets of significance. Still, checking the coordinates, Logan was sure they had come to the right area.

"It could be a ship?" Quinn said, taking a guess. "Maybe he left everything on a big ship and left it out here. It's far enough to not be affected by the sun's gravity, right or is that impossible. Damn, I should have paid more attention in science class."

However, there was no need for guesses because they could eventually see something, and it was not what any of them had suspected.

It was a giant metallic ring that was larger than the Bertha ship. Next to the ring were almost two buildings attached to it. Letting them know what it was straight away.

"What is a space station doing all the way out here?" Quinn asked.

Checking the computer and scanning for information. Logan quickly accessed the military's databases, including all of the other groups.

"This space station. It's not registered. There are no records of it. It isn't one belonging to the military or any factions of the past." Logan answered.

"So that means…we don't even know where this space station goes," Mona replied. "It might not even go back to Earth's solar system."

The question after that was, where did it go then. Of course, Quinn and the others were going to find out.

******

# Chapter 1314 - The Unknown Space Station
Usually, they should have long since received a transmission from those inside, either asking them what they wanted or just to warn them against approaching any closer. Since there was no such thing, it was safe to assume that it was abandoned. If the group wanted to find out what Richard Eno had left them, they had no choice but to enter the space station itself.

It was unclear whether whatever they were supposed to find was on the space station, or it was wherever it led to. Either way, before just recklessly turning it on and jumping through it, the trio decided to explore it in hopes of finding some hint at just what they had in store.

The two large buildings were at either side of the giant floating ring, and the bridge was what connected all three parts together which would run underneath the ring. The ship landed on top of the building which was as large as a hotel. They weren't too sure if all equipment was working on the space station so all three of them had to wear specially designed military space suits.

The special suits were quite fitting to one's body, but they were designed so there was a minimal loss of movement. Still, there was noticeable loss on the user's end. There were also thrusters on the suites which would allow them temporarily fly through space, but not for any significant distance.

"I don't really know how to use this." Mona admitted.

Both Logan and Quinn looked at each other as they found it strange. Both of them had been forced to practice using something similar to the suites during their time at school. That was regular school, not even the military one.

"You guys should know that I'm older than you, I went to school before the first Dalki war." Mona understood what they were thinking. "Of course, the military did put us through some training when the war started, but since I created my own faction I never really had to bother with that stuff."

Because of this, Logan put a special backpack that he would normally use for himself. It was what the spider legs he used came out of, and Mona was now wearing it. When leaving the ship, the spider legs dug in the ground and moved along with her, and it made sure that she stayed more grounded even if anything was to accidentally hit her and she was to drift off.

It was a good thing they had done as well, because due to the whole space station seemingly being offline, it looked like none of the live support systems were online.

"Alright, so we'll go through this half of the building first and see if we can find anything. There should be a control centre here and another one on the other side as well." Logan explained. "The space stations are set up like that, so it requires two people at the same time at both ends to activate the space station simultaneously. However, with me here we don't really need that so there will be no need for us to split up."

Entering from the top, the group decided to tread carefully through the floors. The other two didn't have super speed like Quinn and he wanted to stay and protect them. The first floor seemed to be filled with nothing but empty beds.

It looked like none of them had been used for a while, and the pattern continued as the whole place felt a little soulless.

"So, what was it like, before the war I mean?" Quinn asked.

"I would love to say that everything was much better, but if I'm being honest, although a lot of things changed before and after, some things remained the same." Mona replied. "Have you ever heard of the 'No Lethal Weapons Act'?'"

Quinn shook his head, and so did Logan as he was interested in world history. They were only taught up to a certain point in time, and even across the internet it seemed like beyond a certain date all records just vanished. Perhaps a lot of it was destroyed during the first Dalki war, which was why Logan was unable to access it. 1000s of years of history lost in servers somewhere, unable to be recovered.

"I'm not surprised, if there are still any people from my grandfather's generation alive they might still remember it, though it got scrapped around my father's generation and the only way we have of learning of old history is stories passed down. Anyway, it was introduced at a time when the world was so scared that it would destroy itself that all of the countries at the time had to agree to no longer use lethal weapons. This included basic things like guns."

"On the surface level the world was peaceful for a long while, but even then there was still corruption in every country. Then of course, one of the countries broke this act, and war started as if the act never existed in the first place."

"When I was a kid, it honestly felt like the world was soon going to destroy each other. Everyone was predicting the end. Yet, what probably saved us from that fate was the attack from the Dalki. Humanity was suddenly forced to band together."

"The concept of countries was no longer important, it was just the human race against them. Honestly, it seems like whatever you do, you can't fix the whole world. History just repeats itself again and again. Which is why I made my own family. Although I can't control others, I am in control of myself. So I made sure that I could look after my family. I just never expected my family to grow so big." Mona replied.

Although Mona didn't seem too fond of the world before the war, Quinn still wondered what it was like before everyone had been made aware of abilities. Ray, his ancestor must have also fought through some crazy times.

'What about you Vincent, you were alive before the war, right?' Quinn asked.

'The vampires always tried to live a quiet life before the others. But you lived part of my life when I was on Earth, although there were bad times there were good times as well. I'm sure after this war is over you will be able to celebrate these good times with your friends and family, Quinn.' Vincent replied.

Just as expected, after going through every floor, they found no signs of life, but Quinn's nose did manage to find something a little strange. That was when they entered the kitchen. There was a storage room at the very back. Opening it, it was ice cold and it reminded Quinn of another place he had been to a long time ago.

However, there was no food inside. Searching he was trying to find if there was anything there, Quinn pulled some of the frozen draws that were frozen shut. The ice cracked from them and that's when Quinn could see it. There were blood packs. Hundreds and hundreds of blood packs.

Using his Inspect skill, Quinn found that the blood here, similar to the one in the Vampire World, all belonged to one person. They were cloning blood.

"This place was a space station for the vampires to use." Quinn declared quite confidently.

'I've never heard of such a thing. The vampires had the advanced technology to use teleporters.' Vincent commented. 'We had already figured out a way to use one teleporter to go wherever we wished so the use of space stations seems redundant.'

'Well the teleporters have their disadvantages, right?' Quinn countered. 'For one's ending a large group takes a long time, and you aren't able to send ships through either.'

Essentially, the perfect use for space stations was to send out a large group of ships, and there were only a few reasons why someone might have wanted to do that. The group eventually continued looking through the station but there was no other sign that vampires used to work in the place.

Seeing as they had come here following Richard's instructions, the likeliest scenario was that it had been used by him and his clones. Entering the command centre in one room, Logan placed one hand on the terminal activating his ability.

He was trying to find out any information he could, it didn't take long for him to take it off again.

"That's strange." Logan said. "The terminal works fine, and I can link up with the other one to open the space station, but it seems that whoever had been here, all the information about where it goes to, its logs, pretty much everything else has been cleared."

"Not just deleted but wiped to the point where I can't see, much less restore it. Everything but one thing. An input of a single destination, that doesn't exactly make sense. If I was to take a guess, its coordinates to go to once we get through this place."

Hearing these words, all three of them had goosebumps. Logan was the only one that would have been able to access certain information from a space station like so, the original coordinates to the space station was given to Mona.

Did this mean Richard knew from the beginning what they would do and who they would bring? Had he really been able to see that far ahead? It was almost as if the ancient vampire had the ability to predict the future.

After figuring this out, the group went to the other building through the bridge but they found that it only contained the same thing. So it was time for Logan to open up the space station. Activating it, it would take a few hours for the energy to start up and the space station to turn on so they decided to wait outside in the ship they had come in.

Eventually the space station was active and it was time for them to see what was on the other side. The group decided to keep the space suits on, just in case something happened to the ship on the other side.

Quinn, also made sure to have his Shadow ability ready to use at any point and time.

"Here we go." Logan said, activating the ship's thrusters and propelling them forward through the teleporter, in mere seconds they found themselves on the other side. In a new section of space.

In the distance they could see a large sun, and several planets that were floating about, Logan immediately went to the controls, to scan what was up ahead but it was as he thought.

"We have no information on any of these planets. They don't belong to the Beast solar system or Earth's. We are in a completely unknown area to humans at the moment, so where are we?"

As for Quinn he had an idea. The Vampire Planet that they would regularly visit, also wasn't part of the Beast planets solar system or Earth's.

"Maybe, we've just found a new way to the Vampire World?" He mused.

*****

# Chapter 1315 - The Sun Blocker
Each solar system was a little different, starting with the size of its respective sun, over the number of planets, their rotation speed, number of respective moons and a whole lot more. However, that was unique about the Beast planets solar system and Earth's was that they were the only known ones to have signs of life.

In the first place, the only reason humanity had been able to travel to the Beast solar system was due to the technology that had been created by Richard Eno. At the time, everyone had believed that the scientist had somehow managed to reverse engineer the teleporters the Dalki had on their ships. Of course, these days Quinn didn't know how much to believe in those stories and achievements of his ancestors.

"This is amazing! I wonder if the planets here also have signs of life. Could you imagine what it would mean for humanity if we found a solar system, away from all the Dalki?" Logan asked in excitement. He allowed their ship to continue going towards the destination that had been left at the space station, but if possible he would love nothing more than to land on one of the planets nearby and explore.

"If that was true, then there are resources here that are untapped by the Dalki and the humans. It could solve our crystal problem if we were able to hunt on these secretly." Mona also quickly grasped the strategic importance of such a place.

"You two seem to be forgetting something." Quinn found it odd that he had to be the one to point this out, but most likely his companions were just too excited at this revelation. "We didn't discover this place. We followed Eno's instructions to what we can only assume to have been his space station that led us here. What's more we came out of another space station, which means this place has already been discovered. Keep that in mind."

Through this realization the others were on guard now.

Eventually, the ship started to head towards one planet in particular, but there were no signs of a civilization that could be seen on this planet. Using his soul weapon. Logan decided to modify the upper part of the ship and create a new type of telescope device that could zoom to the point where they could see what was on the surface of the planet. This would link up with his monitor and record information for himself.

He then zoomed in on the planet to see if he could find anything, and that's when he could see it. On one of the dark purple coloured planets there were strange blob-like creatures. There were signs of life. Whether they were like beasts or not they did not know. Perhaps the crystals were a unique trait to the beasts that were found in the beasts solar system. After all, standard animals from earth did not have any crystals of energy inside their body.

Looking past a few planets, they eventually came across a strange one. The planet itself wasn't what was strange but it was what was next to it. A little far from the planet itself, they could see a large metallic object. It was a distance away from the planet, and stayed in front of the sun. What was strange about it was that it looked like the object wasn't orbiting around the planet and stayed in place.

'That…I have an idea what that is. It looks like your hypothesis was correct Quinn.' Vincent said. 'What you guys are looking at in front of you should be the Vampire World.'

Although Vincent himself had been on Earth when the vampires had decided to move planets, he recognized the device because it was something that the vampires had been trying to create for the longest time. The blueprints to such a device had already appeared during his time, but the finished version differed slightly to what he remembered. Nevertheless, it was clear enough that this device could block out the sunlight.

Vincent had found it strange that the vampires had found a planet that had allowed them to avoid the sunlight, while also not having it freeze over, eradicating all signs of life. It looked like they were successful but Vincent wasn't exactly pleased about this.

The only reason the device hadn't been constructed during his era, had been because they were afraid the vampires would use it to their advantage, for a way for them to block out the sunlight on Earth as well.

'Maybe it is a good thing that they moved.' Vincent thought.

"Logan, scan that planet over there, but do so from a distance. It will be for the best if they don't see us." Quinn requested. Moving the ship further away, Logan zoomed into the planet. On one side it looked to be completely dark and he could see forests and mountains, there didn't seem to be much.

They didn't see what Quinn was expecting but they were only able to look at part of the planet in the first place, and the settlement could have been anywhere, but just seeing the way the planet looked itself, it definitely reminded Quinn of the place.

"Is that our destination?" Quinn wondered if Richard had set up some base on the vampire planet. It would make sense for him to want to keep an eye on them.

"No it looks like it's quite far again, just like the space station we found it doesn't seem to be close to the other planets." Logan answered.

What this also meant, was another few days of travel. As more time passed Quinn was getting more anxious about the possible situation on the Cursed ship, the Cursed faction planets and Vampire World.

It might have only been days, but anything could have happened. However, the good news was, that even while in this section their communication devices back to the Cursed ship were still working, so they were happy to know that everything was still okay on their end.

Quinn continued to practice his third stage of Qi, while Mona was now using her spare time to test out the thrusters on the suit. It was something one had to get used to, but it was one of those things similar to swimming or riding a bike, that once you got the hang of the feeling it was easy to do. Becoming an expert or using it efficiently was of course a different story.

Finally it looked like they had reached their destination and once again they were in for a surprise. After discovering a whole solar system full of planets they thought their destination would be one of the planets. Instead it looked like they had come across a large stationery ship.

It was large in size, almost as big as the Bertha ships, but was flat like a giant saucer. However the center of it there was a large dome. Ship might have also been the wrong word to describe it, since it looked like it had no thrusters and wouldn't move in place, but it was definitely man made.

"Well it looks like this was Eno's secret little base. It's pretty big. I'm guessing he would have had a lab here as well. If we're lucky and the information hasn't been scrapped, I might even be able to find out the secret behind how he created those clones." Logan claimed.

If that was the case, perhaps they could create one for Vincent to use as well.

"I think it's safe to assume that Eno must have left something here. I don't believe he would lead us to this place if it didn't have anything that could help us in this war." Mona mused.

This was why Quinn wanted to come here as well, but more so he was hoping he would find out the reason for why Eno had done so much. "I want to know why Eno wanted to save the human race. Why did he have such a will and determination to risk his life, and is he even…dead."

Surrounding the strange giant saucer ship, they could see several large square containers as well. They looked like giant storage containers but were made of metal and were attached to the giant saucer like some type of tube.

"What do you think they are?" Logan asked.

It was at that moment that Logan received a message coming from the computer terminal.

"Unidentified ship has entered the area. Please state the password."

The voice was robotic, and Logan could tell this was bad news.

"Password? What password? Mona, did Eno mention anything about a password you forgot to mention?" Logan asked, looking over to the woman. The others looked at each other, because if they didn't figure out the password they were afraid that something could happen soon.

Logan quickly typed in the coordinates that he had been given both times into the machine, but both of them came up with a wrong answer.

"Quinn, this is your crazy grandpa do you have any ideas?" Logan asked.

His mind was drawing a blank. It wasn't as if he and Richard had shared a particularly intimate relationship, so how was he supposed to know? "Uhm, try his own name maybe?"

*Beep

"My name?"

*Beep

"I love humans?"

*Beep

"Equivalent exchange!"

Quinn and Mona kept throwing out suggestions and none of them worked eventually.

"Too many wrong attempts! Activating emergency defensive measures! "

*****

# Chapter 1316 - Space Battle
After coming all this way, what seemed to be the last hurdle that had stopped them from progressing…was a password.

'That senile old man, did he just forget, or is he playing with us!?' Quinn thought, but that didn't matter because they had to prepare for what was about to happen to them next.

A red light could be seen around the edge of the giant saucer ship, which indicated this was no joke.

"I'm preparing defences on the ship!" Logan placed both hands on the command centre and was prepared to use his ability to somehow get them out of this station. He was, after all, the best when it came to things like this.

Quinn strangely had his eyes closed because he could hear something. Due to it being muffled, he wasn't quite sure what it was. Tracking the strange noise led his eyes to the peculiar giant containers linked to the main ship, which were slowly opening up.

No laser blasts were being fired from the ship. Instead, the four containers attached to the ship were the only things moving. When the doors were fully opened, multiple tentacles immediately grabbed onto the outside of the container, gripping tightly. Soon it used the container to push itself off and leapt through the open space, catapulting and revealing its whole body.

It was a living creature, but not one like they had seen before. Usually, beasts on the beast planets had a resemblance to those animals that they had on earth. Although there could be those vastly different at times, there was always a base for the beasts.

This however, was something that looked to have come straight out of a nightmare. The tentacles on its body were the only thing remotely recognisable. It had several mouths all over its body, opening and closing, bearing its razor-sharp teeth while also emitting a strange slime that would fall from them.

Its head was an odd shape, almost hammer-like, and as for its eyes. It was anyone's best guess where they were.

[Inspect]

[A Demi-god tier beast known as the Galactic Worm]

"There are Demi-god tier beasts. They'll be powerful, so we have to be careful!" Quinn warned.

"Did you say Demi-god tier, but there's four of them!" Mona counted just to make sure.

Although Demi-god tier beasts were considered considerably weaker than Demon tier beasts. Usuelly it meant they only needed to deal with one beast, groups of people could work together, or in the worst case, they could run away.

However, fighting against four strong beasts at once. Even a powerful ability user would struggle, but Quinn, faced with this situation, smiled.

"This has to be a blessing. If we kill these beasts, we will obtain four powerful crystals we can use and create another item." Quinn was already running over to exit from the ship. Since he had his space suit on, he could easily go out to fight.

Leaping off from the ship, Quinn drifted into space and used the thrusters to propel him forward. In space, he was unable to rely on one thing, and that was his footwork and speed. He could still move his arms and legs just as fast to attack, but moving around the beast or getting in a good position would be difficult.

Because of this, Quinn soon found himself in front of only two of the Demi-god tier beasts. The worms were able to freely move in space somehow, and it was then that they avoided a confrontation with Quinn and decided to go straight for the ship.

"Mona! I can probably deal or hold one of them, but I'm gonna need you to try your best to handle another, or at least protect the ship!" Logan said.

Although Mona was reluctant to go out outside, she knew how dire the situation was and did so. She still had the spider legs with her, but she also decided that it would be best for her to stay on the ship, rather than trying to manoeuvre in space like a certain someone.

"So I can't fight the way I usually do. This might be quite difficult." Mona thought, for at the same time, Logan was widely moving the ship, trying to get away from the worm beasts. The only thing keeping her on at the moment was the spider legs.

Lazers fired out from the ship, hitting the strange worms once in a while, but eventually, one of the worms was able to latch onto the ship with its tentacle, sticking to it like glue. It pulled itself over and opened its largemouths, spitting out the strange green sludge.

Mona quickly avoided the attacks, jumping and moving out of the way, seeing the weird slime hit the ship.

"Oh, I thought it was acid, but it doesn't seem to have done anything to the ship?" Mona said.

She ran up to the beast avoiding all the green slime and attempted to punch it with her fist. When she did, she soon saw that where her fist was going to hit wasn't a hard part of the flesh, but it was just one of its several mouths on its body that was closed. It opened up wide, ready to chomp down at her, but Mona was fast and quickly spun her body, aiming to hit another area with a kick.

Before she could hit it, she found herself struck by the strange green slime. She tried to quickly wipe it off, but it just stuck to her other arm.

'This is annoying, it doesn't seem to do anything, but it looks like I can't get it off either. If I keep getting hit by this slime, it will keep adding up. What a pain in the ar- '

Out from the side, she had been whacked by the tentacle, it was a strong blow, stronger than what the spider legs could handle, and soon she could be seen drifting in space.

Activating the thrusters, she tried to correct her body position but overused them, spinning her top half forward looking like she was doing a front flip. She tried activating them again and started to spin back in the other direction. If she didn't get a hold of how to use this thing, then she would soon become food for the Demi-god tier beats

"I thought that something like this might happen." Logan moved the ship close to mona. Converting the top half into a claw, grabbing her in space.

It was an embarrassing situation for Mona ,but she was thankful and paid close attention to the whole situation. One of the Worms was still on the ship, while the other had been hit quite a few times by Logan's lasers. It was more hurt than the one she was fighting. In fact, she had done no damage at all to the beast.

Seeing this a plan came into her head.

"Hey, chuck me over to that one. You can do that right!" Mona shouted through the receiver.

"I can, but I don't think you'll reach that far," Logan replied.

"Don't worry, I can use the thrusters. I may not be good at this thing, but I know how to just go forward at least."

Even though Mona claimed she knew how to go forward, Logan wasn't too sure from what he had seen so far. He was worried that throwing her to the other beast would mean he took part in her death. Still, he listened as the ship charged forward and threw Mona. She activated her thrusters, giving her a boost, and she latched onto the strange hand on top of the beasts.

Immediately, several mouths all over its body started to bite Mona while also emptying the strange green sludge onto her body. Still, she had a smile on her face.

"I wasn't trying to kill you in the first place. If I couldn't do anything about an injured demi-god tier beast, it would be an embarrassment to say I was one of the big four!" Pressing her hand against the beast's head, it only took a few moments before she was in control.

Now she had her very own space beasts that could perfectly move well in space. "Now, let's get rid of your brother, or sister, or whatever relation you guys have."

After taking control of one of the beasts, it was easy for Mona and the beasts to take care of the one attached to the ship. First, the mouths that made the strange green slime could also eat it back up off of Mona's body, so she was free to move, and Logan had learned something else.

It could understand Mona's intentions. When fighting with her, the beast moved the way she wanted to. Logan was also able to aid with his blasters. Eventually, they successfully defeated the Worm, obtaining its crystal letting it float in space.

That's when the two of them finally had the time to see how much trouble Quinn was having.

Only there wasn't much for them to see. He had already defeated the two of them. The beasts were dead with gigantic holes in the centre of their body. He had two Demi-god tier crystals in his hand, but he just floated in place there.

'This is it, I finally did, I did it without the help of Leo or others. This is the power of the third stage of Qi.' Quinn smiled to himself, having finally made a breakthrough. These days spent on the ship didn't seem useless, and with the beasts dealt with, they could finally enter the ship and find out just what Eno had in store for them.

*****

# Chapter 1317 - The Rewards
Other than the four Demi-god tier beasts that had just been dealt with, it didn't look like anything else was appearing from the strange containers. However, for some reason the saucer ship hadn't stopped emitting a bright red light that would fade and brighten up like an alarm. Making them believe that maybe they weren't out of trouble just yet.

They had managed to obtain a new powerful ally, in the form of the Galactic Worm, who at the moment was stuck on the roof of the ship while everyone else was back inside. It was amazing seeing how once a creature was tamed it showed no hostility towards its user, but unlike the Marked it still had a mind of its own. The three Demi-god tier crystals that had been obtained were all given to Quinn to put in his system for the time being.

"Don't you want to keep this?" Quinn asked since Mona had immediately handed him the crystal she had earned. She looked at him for a few seconds. Although she knew she had some claim to it, seeing as she had had to struggle against the Demi-god tier beast due to her still not being that proficient in piloting her suit, it still wouldn't have been an easy job for her.

Nevertheless, Mona knew she had only succeeded because Logan had helped her. It also didn't seem right for her to keep it, seeing as she and Logan had dealt with two together, while Quinn had dealt with two on his own. She had already gotten another Demi-god tier pet out of this, which was more than enough for her.

However, Mona did kind of wish that she had been able to witness what exactly Quinn had done to create two giant holes in their body from the position he had been in.

"Don't you dare refuse to accept it." Mona replied. "You give me a Demon tier Amulet, and I can't even hand you this?" She shoved the crystal away, before Quinn could return it.

"I suggest that we be cautious about entering the place." Logan said as they drifted closer to the ship. "I don't like the fact that the ship is still showing signs of an alarm. It should be a sign that it is still in self defence mode. If nothing is coming at us, I can only assume that it must have activated something inside of it."

Honestly, Logan would very much like to inspect the tubes to see what was the need for them to be inside the containers. Perhaps it was a way to keep the beasts alive while it was trapped there. He also was very interested in finding out how Eno had set it up so it would attack the intruders rather than their own ship.

Nonetheless, it would be best to turn off the safety system first and then explore later, they wouldn't want to go into one of those strange containers and end up being trapped.

Moving around, the saucer ship didn't seem to react in any certain way, and Logan was now outside, as it approached one of the landing points on the ship. With his ability, even if the system didn't want to let them in, he should be able to override its directives.

Touching the door outside, steam left from the ship, as the door slid open. They landed inside the giant saucer ship.

"Carefull." Logan warned them as the whole group left the ship and were now on the metallic ground inside. "The door itself is a separate system to the whole ship so I was unable to turn off the whole system. Looks like Eno was prepared for someone like me to turn up. Still, if we find the main server, I can turn this thing off and maybe find what we're trying to look for."

The group looked around the first area they were in, but there was nothing special about it other than several standard ships inside the landing area. Given its size, they also decided that it was wiser to leave the Galactic Worm to guard the ship, just in case they had any more visitors. Although the pet was strong, now that Mona was on the ground she was confident in her skills again.

While walking around, there were several doors that they could go through. After all, the place was large in size and they had no clue what led to what, but then something unexpected happened. One of the doors suddenly opened up.

"Logan, I'm guessing you weren't the one that did that, right?" Quinn asked.

Logan shook his head, and found it interesting to say the least.

"My family created an AI system that we used to control the house. Wouldn't surprise me if Richard has something like that and it's leading us somewhere. That or he planned it this way."

"Well, should we check out where we're being led to, or should we pick our own route?" Mona asked.

Quinn thought about it for a while, maybe it wasn't even an AI system, maybe Richard was alive and still watching them.

"I think that this is Richard's doing, so let's just play his stupid little game." Quinn decided and the three walked through the just opened door. As soon as all of them had passed through, it immediately shut behind them.

It wasn't really a problem for Quinn, since he could just use Shadow travel to get out again. Nevertheless, it was annoying and just stressed the part that they were being forced to go a certain way.

The three of them were expecting to enter a large hall, but instead they were now in a corridor that could barely fit the three of them, only allowing for minimum movement. There was nothing but a long hallway.

"This reminds me of those trials." Logan commented.

Quinn was thinking the same thing. When they had entered the Vampire World for the first time, they had entered what they suspected to be Richard Eno's lab, where he had been running certain experiments.

The group remained on guard while walking through the hall and at the end they entered a large square room. Here there were three operating doors.

"Seriously, what is wrong with him? He was the one who wanted us here, so why the need for these games?" Quinn asked in frustration.

As if reacting to his little outburst, a screen came out from the ceiling. They waited for a few seconds until they heard a message.

[Face reorganization has been completed.]

[Welcome, Mona, Logan and Quinn.]

[Prerecorded video message will now play.]

"Welcome all to what I guess you could call my home, or more accurately speaking what has been my base of operations for the longest time." Richard Eno said as he appeared on the screen. "If you're seeing this particular message being played, it means that the ones who have arrived are Mona, Logan, and Quinn. However, you being here most likely means that my life has come to an end."

"Our relationship must have been close if I told you about this place, and for you to have trusted me enough to travel all this way here, so don't be saddened by my death."

Quinn almost let out a laugh after hearing this phrase, but just in time he realised how disrespectful that would be. Despite all his faults, it was undeniable that Richard had helped them.

"The fact that you're here must mean that you either have some unanswered questions, or, and I hope this won't be the case, that even after my death you are in need of my help. I have helped save the human race for the longest time now, yet I guess even after my death I won't be allowed to rest. To be honest, I worry what will happen without me."

'Man, the way he talks it's really hard to like this guy.' Quinn thought.

"This is why, I have prepared things for you and only you."

After saying these words, names appeared above each of the doors, each one corresponding to those in the room.

"I have prepared many things that should be able to help you out in your journey going forward, however, since I can't predict when exactly you will see this, I have prepared a test that will analyse your abilities and find the things most compatible with you. I hope you will be worthy of it, otherwise it might be best to save it for someone else that may be of more use in the future."

"Some of you may have powers that can cheat the system, or you might be thinking of taking more than just your own reward, but I advise against doing anything of the sort. If any one of you attempts to cheat my system, all three of you will receive nothing."

"Should all three of you pass the trials that are in front of you, you will also be granted access to the main ship's server, which will allow you to access all the information I have gathered over my lifetime."

"After all, this is knowledge that can not be lost. There is a need for this information and it must be passed on so we keep learning from our mistakes and improve. Now, it's time for you to start your trials." Richard declared with the largest smile on his face.

******

# Chapter 1318 - Passing The Test
The message from Richard had ended there, and just like that the three of them were left stunned in place.

"I just don't understand, can Eno really predict the future, to the point where our names appear above these doors. Maybe what you said was true?" Mona wondered looking towards Logan.

"Probably not he himself, but you did say that you saw him meeting with Bliss before. It could be possible for it all to be set up beforehand due to her visions, especially if the two of them were close like you stated." Logan theorised.

"There is also the chance that it's simply using advanced AI. As long as Richard has information on us, and the AI did say it recognised us because it had scanned our faces. It would be simple to match up faces and names and display them on top of the doors."

While Logan and Mona were busy speaking volumes about Richards' genius, Quinn was silent and left to his own thoughts.

'What kind of rewards could he have left that could help us in our current situation?' Quinn wondered. 'And if he really had something that could give us some sort of power boost, why didn't he bring it along to Blade Island? Why make it difficult on himself?'

'It's a hard question to answer Quinn. Perhaps, Richard is just doing the same thing I did when I first met you. Back when I was in the system I also kept testing you.' Vincent replied. 'Sometimes, when we realise that we aren't able to achieve something, we try to help the future by allowing them to learn from our mistakes.'

Quinn knew that the only one who might be able to answer these questions would have been Richard himself, but that wasn't going to happen now. Still, it would be a lie if the Vampire Lord would claim that he wasn't interested in the promised rewards. He walked up to the door with his name above and the other two stopped talking to look at Quinn.

"Let me be the first one to go in." Quinn said. "You should wait until I'm done, so I can give you an idea what happened to me. I have the Shadow ability, so in case there's something dangerous in there, I should have no problem getting out. Sure I might not get the reward but at least I'll still survive. It's a different story for you two."

"Do you really think that Richard would put something so dangerous that it could kill us?" Mona asked.

Quinn nodded, he didn't even have to think about it. Richard Eno was the type of guy who would do anything to achieve his goal. If he wanted to test their 'worthiness', the ancient vampire wouldn't shy away from using possibly fatal means.

Walking up to the door, Quinn pressed his hand against it to see if it would open.

Unfortunately, it only resulted in another AI announcement.

[One person has accepted the challenge.]

[All three must accept their challenge to proceed.]

"Of course, he wouldn't let us catch a break." Quinn chuckled to himself. He was wondering if he should take the test on his own, if he completed it, then he could always just come back and save the others if there was a need to, but it looked like all three of them would have to agree to take the test and do so at the same time for the door to open.

"I won't pressure you guys to do anything you don't want to do." Quinn said with a smile turning around, but the other two were no longer where they once were. Quinn could hear two beeping sounds almost instantly.

Turning to his left and right he could see both of them already with their hands against the door.

[All three participants have accepted the test.

Once all three enter their test room, the doors will be shut and the test will begin.

WARNING; The tests will have to be taken alone.

Any interruptions by other participants will result in immediate failure!

Passing the test will open up another door, leading to your respective rewards!]

With the doors open, Quinn lifted up both hands and gave a thumbs up to them both before walking in and now all three of them were in a pitch black room. They were separate from each other.

Quinn thought that perhaps with his heightened senses he would be able to hear the others in their rooms, but he was unable to hear anything.

Until the sound of some electronics were moving in his room, it sounded like a platform was appearing from underneath and he could see a person being lifted up into the room, one that looked identical to Richard himself.

"You're not Richard… at least not the real one, right?" Quinn asked.

"No." The person shook his head. "I am but a mere clone, who was woken up by your arrival. Although if you're here, it should mean the original has perished, so I might be as real as I can be. I should have all his memories, at least up to the moment he created me."

Hearing this, Quinn was looking forward to asking the clone some questions about Eno and his intentions, however he didn't get the chance.

"It's time for your test. If you succeed, you might get the answers you seek."

———

In the other rooms, both Logan and Mona had been placed in the same situation, each of them meeting with a clone of Eno.

"Mona, I'm elated that you were among those who have come here. Honestly, there was a good chance that you wouldn't have come." The clone spoke with a mild smile on his face. Given their age difference, they resembled a grandfather who was looking lovingly over his granddaughter.

"You're crucial to humanity's fate in your own way and I don't mean just because you created a force that allowed you rise to the position of one of the Big Four."

"The truth is, I didn't save your life, it was more of me hiding you. There is someone out there who is looking for your powers more than you might believe and I fear that if they obtain it, then it would mean the human race will once again create another problem for themselves."

"You already know them, it's the group known as Pure. They might not seem like that much of a threat with the war that is going on, but they are dabbling in cross breeding humans with beasts creating something that might even be worse than Dalki. I fear that they will succeed, as history has already seen it happen a long time ago.".

"The events that have played out have all been scratched and rewritten, but I've watched it happen. Your ancestors played a crucial part in helping save the world back then with their powers, which is why I returned the favour by protecting your family from the shadows."

"Whatever happens, you must not allow Pure to get their hands on you. I know you care for the people around you, so you will try your best to help them. There seems to be others that hold grudges against Pure as well. Perhaps some day they can aid you in their fight. With all the troubles you and the world will face, I have left you something that you will be able to use in the war."

Mona looked confused for a second, as she stared at Eno's clones. She had been listening carefully the whole time. She didn't know too much about her family, similar to Quinn's; they had ended up dying in the war, yet they had passed on next to nothing to her. She had heard the rumours that Pure had kidnapped some of her members but what she was concerned about was something else.

"What about my test? Don't I have to prove that I am worthy of the reward!" Mona asked.

"You have passed the test simply by coming here. Humans show a lot of discrimination to what they can't understand or those that are different to them. They have done this for centuries, but you… you found out what I was and still chose to trust me by coming here, and you have come here with another that is like myself."

It was then strangely, that the clone lifted both its hands up, covering them with red aura. Mona had a bad feeling of what was about to happen, and using both its arms Clone Eno killed himself on the spot.

As soon as the clone died and fell to the ground, the door on the other side opened up. Walking towards the door Mona stopped by the dead body which lay on the floor. She turned it over so she could see Richard's face.

"I never did get to say goodbye. You might have protected me for your own reasons, but that doesn't change the fact that you looked after me and for that you have my gratitude."

She gently placed her hands over his eyelids, shutting them before walking through the door and out of the black room. The door behind had closed, and she now was in some type of strange lab.

A giant glass tube container could be seen in front of her, and floating inside was a headless man.

"What is this, and who…who is that?" Mona thought.

Walking up to the glass tube, she could then see a digital name running across the top.

[Oscar White]

*****

# Chapter 1319 - The Other Tests
It was just a body without its head, floating inside the container. There was no visible wound on the body to indicate that someone had removed the head. It almost looked smooth as if there had never been a head there in the first place.

'My sources did tell me that our 'retired' Supreme Commander, had lost a fight against One Horn, and that his body seemed to have been mostly destroyed, aside from his head, but this… this makes no sense.' Mona thought as she walked up to the container trying to see if she could find the head. It didn't take her long to find what she was looking for.

Off to the side, a few meters away another glass container was seen. Inside It was filled with liquid and she could see a floating head. One that was without a doubt Oscar's. However, when making eye contact with such a thing, she felt her stomach churning, goosebumps appearing over her arms.

It looked like Oscar without a shadow of a doubt, but for whatever reason he now had a creepy smile spread across his face. It stretched from ear to ear, and it wouldn't stop. Getting closer to it, she placed her hand on the glass.

"Richard… how is this meant to help us win the war? What have you done to him?" Mona mumbled the question to herself. In that split second as she lifted her hand off of the glass container, the eyes inside moved and were now staring right at her, while the smile still hadn't faded.

"It's alive!" Mona let out a scream as she nearly fell over backwards. She quickly stabilised herself and was glad that she was the only one in the room. As she slowly regained some of her calm demeanor people knew her foe. She started to walk around the room and found that the eyes of Oscar continually followed her.

"Oscar, what has he done to you? Are you really still alive there? You can hear me, right?" Mona asked, but there was no reply, no blinking, only his eyes that followed her every step and that unsettling smile that wouldn't disappear.

'Now what do I do?' Mona thought as she waited in the room, there were four doors in total, the one she came from, one to her left, one to her right and another straight ahead, but only her own had opened up.

'I guess I have no other choice but to wait until the other two are done. Unfortunately, I doubt he will have made their tests as easy as mine. Hopefully Logan or Quinn can figure out what has happened to Oscar, and what exactly we should do with him.'

——

Logan was currently face to face with one of Richard's clones. However, unlike Quinn, he didn't give the other any chance to speak, instead he instantly took control over the situation.

"You told me that Jim was the one who killed my parents. That he was the one who had taken over the AI in my house, but for what?" Logan asked. "Judging from what we have learned from you, we have gathered that you are a person who is willing to do anything, and I mean ANYTHING for the sake of the human race."

"Now I don't know if you were telling the truth, or you simply allowed it to happen because you found that my skills would surpass my parents but only if you thought I needed something to give me that extra push to grow stronger, to give me a reason to fight our enemy. I just know that my parents are dead, Jim is dead and even the real you is dead, so what does that mean now?" Logan asked him with slinted eyes, his balled up hands shaking.

Clone Richard was silent for a while, he was patiently waiting for Logan to let out all of his anger.

"I deeply regret what has happened to your family, but I have told you the truth." The clone replied. "You saw it in your own family's logs, how there was a promise between our families. I promised that I would protect them, yet I failed to save your parents, and it was even at the hands of my own blood line."

"Whatever you want to do, you'll have to decide for yourself. The members of your Green family have always acted out of a desire to discover new things and to accumulate knowledge, not because of revenge, Logan. Seeing as their blood runs through your veins, I'm sure you'll do the right thing."

"Should you pass, and I pray that you do, the reward that awaits you will be all the knowledge I have amassed over my lifetime. The creation of clones, the world's REAL history and more. However, once you gain possession of that knowledge, there will be others like you who will come after you to seek it out."

"While the pursuit of knowledge might be a noble thing, certain things can't be allowed to fall into the wrong hands. Now that I can no longer protect you, you'll have to be able to protect yourself."

Stepping aside, a teleporter started to rise out from the ground. Logan didn't know what his test was, but it seemed like it would be one that was to test his strength. One of the areas that he was lacking in.

Logan understood that this was his last chance to refuse to take the test. If he went through, there was likely no way out for him, other than completing the task or die trying.

'Knowledge, is that what I want? All I've been thinking about all this time were my parents…but is Richard telling me to forget about all that, to just enjoy life as me?'

Not yet clear about his answer, Logan hoped that he might find it in the reward itself. After a bit of hesitation, he concluded that he had come too far to just abandon everything.

Once stepping through the teleporter, he experienced the usual feeling of getting transported somewhere else. Unsurprisingly, he didn't end up anywhere that he recognised.

Immediately, Logan put on his speed suit and started to scan the area. Since it was dark and night on the planet, night vision was a basic requirement. Looking around, he found himself in some sort of junkyard. There were several scraps of rubbish metals and more all over the place, but so far no signs of any beasts.

Carefully checking out the area, Logan was waiting for his AI to gather more information. It quickly became apparent that this planet wasn't one that was on his database.

'Could it be one of the planets of the sector we are currently in? Since the reward should be behind the door in that room I was just in, there has to be a way for me to return. Is that my test, to survive and find the teleporter back?' Logan wondered.

Figuring that this was a new planet, Logan decided to have a look at what exactly this rubbish was. There were things he had never seen before, and things that looked similar. Walking up to one of the large piles, he soon saw objects falling down from the top of the pile. Looking more closely, he discovered a single horn sticking out from the top.

Quickly, Logan jumped back, and readied his blasters.

Moving from the rubbish, it revealed a beast that looked similar to a muscular dog, only its jaws seemed to extend far wider than should be possible. Opening its mouth it revealed a tongue that would be as long as a frog and seemingly just as flexible.

Unfortunately, that creature wasn't alone. Logan noticed that other trash piles started moving and more and more of the dog-like beasts began to appear.

One of the beasts, opened its mouth wide growling at Logan, so he wasted no time using his blaster firing directly in its mouth.

"How do you like the power of a raw intermediate crystal?!" Logan shouted, confident that the beast wouldn't get up from it. He was right, but there were already ten of his buddies in the area around Logan, and if there were more of them, he began to worry how many his blaster could kill before running out of energy.

Quinn was ready to hear the details of his test and was waiting for Eno to explain, but instead. The clone stepped to the side, and there was a platform underneath him.

"For your test to begin, we first must make some preparations, please step on here." The clone instructed him.

On the ground, Quinn could see a strange circle with several different shapes and characters he was unable to read. He was worried that this could be something disastrous.

'Have you seen this before? Does it have something to do with the equivalent exchange ability?' Quinn asked.

'I have no clue what is about to happen. It's your call Quinn.' Vincent replied.

Quinn had already made up his mind, so he decided to not hesitate and step on the strange circle. The next message that had appeared he wasn't expecting.
