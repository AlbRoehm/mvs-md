# Chapter 1950 The Lock On Ability

Zero stood on one spot, with his eyes closed and his hand over the hilt of his weapon. His left foot was placed slightly forward as if he was in a position to strike at any moment.

Now, it was all up to Erin to hold off the celestial for the time being. She pointed her large great sword at the red being in the sky, and the first ring on her sword started to light up. The first skill activated, creating a large ice tunnel which shot out straight from her sword.

The attack was as powerful as it always was, freezing everything it touched, even turning parts of the moisture in the air around it into droplets of ice. Usually, whatever the ice touched it would freeze over, making it one of the deadliest skills in existence.

However, for Gorgath, he just flew straight ahead through the air, the orbs continued to spin all over his body, generating more energy. It was hard to believe how much power he had because even after already using so much of it in the fight so far, there were no signs at all of the celestial weakening.

He threw out his fist, and the instant it touched the ice tunnel, it started to form over, but moments later sparks of energy emitted from the skin, destroying the ice on the spot. This was the same for all over Gorgath's body, allowing him to dive right through the ice tunnel with no trouble at all.

It was breaking as his body was touching every bit of it. Seeing this, Erin didn't give up, not like how she would have done, and twisted the handle. The Demon tier attachment activated, turning the blade from one with powers of ice to one with powers of the flame.

The reset for the first skill had a separate cool down, and now instead of a tunnel of ice going out toward her opponent there was a tunnel of flames. After passing through the ice, gorgath could now feel the intense heat instead, his body was resistant to the flames, but his powers didn't seem to work as well in fending off the attack.

Even then, he decided to throw his fist out. Expanding out a large  amount of energy and force. The attack from a punch alone had covered the flames, putting them out. These weren't just ordinary flames either, but one form had a meon tier weapon making it even more impressive.

As soon as the flames had disappeared though, heading right towards his face, was the edge of the sword. Tilting his head down slightly, the broken part of his horn had hit Erin's blade.

Just like Zero, she was putting her Qi and dhampir energy into the attack, she also had large amounts but not to the level where she could injure the horn in the same way. It was clear that the celestial power would win out.

Her hands were feeling numb and her legs were losing their footing as they were pushed further away and into the ground.

'Just because I'll lose out in a battle of strength, doesn't mean that I will lose this fight.'

Keeping her sword in contact with the horn, Erin leapt up in the air, and pulled her sword away. The moment she did, Gorgath's body continued forward and crashed into the ground. He quickly turned around, bearing his teeth toward Erin, only to be met with a wave of yellow aura strikes.

Each one hit his body, causing him to flinch slightly, but causing him no harm as he continued to move forward, and threw out his fist again. Erin spun her body, avoiding the attack, and threw out her blade once more, smashing it into the back of Gorgath.

The sword had hit his right shoulder, freezing it slightly. The normal energy form Gorgath's skin would get rid of it, but before it did the orbs on his body started to spin producing the energy in sight.

Out of anger, Grogath slammed both of his hands on the ground. Creating a large blast of energy that had hit Erin, throwing her up in the air. She covered her body with Qi, but was still hurt as she eventually landed on the ground flat on her back.

'He…still has this much energy that is just as strong as his first hit. Even if I use my skills, my powers and everything I have, will I be able to take this monster down? This person with an endless amount of energy?' Erin thought.

Getting up off the ground she was contemplating using every little trick she had up her sleeve.

"I'm ready!" A voice shouted from behind, and the voice was a familiar one, the old man that didn't look very old was ready.

Opening his eyes, the colour of Zero's seemed to have changed. The outside of it was glowing white. A sign that his ability had been activated.

'Watching Erin's fight just then gave me a clue how this celestial works. I was a bit foolish and should have realised sooner. Perhaps then this fight wouldn't have been nearly as hard as it had to be.'

"Let's finish this!" Zero pulled out the sword from his sheet, and a large amount of energy was released at once.

Just like his sword , the energy came out with a pinkish tint of power.

"A 100,000 Qi strike!" Zero shouted.

This confused Erin, she could sense the energy was the same as before, the strike was no more powerful than his first one, so what had she been doing all this time for him to buy time?

Using her ability further though, she could see that there was still plenty of energy left in the sheath. Placing his sword back in again, Zero pulled it out.

"A 110,000 Qi Strike!" Zero shouted again.

He repeated this process a few more times, each time releasing different amounts of energy in his strikes.

"A 120,000 Qi strike!"

"A 130,000 Qi strike!"

"A 140,000 Qi strie!"

"A 150,000 Qi Strike!"

All of the lines of aura left his sword and were headed straight for Gorgath. Gorgath could tell that these strikes had celestial energy in them as well, and so far they were the only strikes that had hurt him.

So for him, it made more sense to avoid the attacks rather than take them head-on, or try to hit them. With the attacks being so far away, he had plenty of time to avoid them as well.

Moving, gorgath went to avoid the first strike, when he could see that it suddenly had turned towards him. He lifted his hand to block the attack, but the attack itself condensed and made itself smaller, as it slashed right against one of the orbs on his arms.

Several sparks went off as the two collided and the orb was no longer spinning in place,and eventually the orb cracked, exploding with energy and splitting into several pieces.

Looking at the destroyed orb in his arm, for the first time, Gorgath was frightened and with the other attacks coming his way. He started to move and was on the run. However, just like before, the attacks seemed to follow him.

"It's useless." Zero stated. "With my ability, once a target has been selected no matter what, my attack will hit them, with the same amount of energy as I put out, even if you ran for a 1000 years that attack would hit you."

Since what Zero said seemed to be somewhat true, Goragth stopped running through the air, and attempted to hit one, but as he did, the attack changed shape and size and once again had hit another orb on its arm breaking it to pieces and causing another explosion on Gorgath's body.

"I know you're scared." Zero smiled. "Those orbs on your body that's how you are able to produce your energy to fight us.As long as there spinning your able to produce as much energy as you want and need, endlessly, but the same can't be said if they were destroyed, and I have the power to get rid of them."

Closing his hands, all of the attacks move towards gorgath at once. He trutled up bracing himself, trying to cover at least the orbs on his chest and body from being destroyed.

Yet, just like before, through the cracks and gaps that would be made,the attacks reached their target, and each of them hit their target. Several explosions went off, red sparks of fire were covering the entire sky, and a limp body of Goragth could be seen falling through the air.

It landed on the ground, and Gorgath was hurt.

"Not yet…not all of my power is reliant on these things." Gorgath said as he lifted himself up. "I have more celestial energy than you.. Even if you take away part of my strength, I can still beat you!"

Slowly pulling himself up, a power seemed to be rising in Gorgath, until a loud thud was heard, and looking down he could see a hand through his chest.

Pulling it out, goragth felt a kick sending him to the floor, and his body soon was becoming nothing but particles.

"I'm sick and tired of waiting." The person said, standing over his body. "I no longer want to watch, it's time we get rid of you all, and Erin. I'm personally going to be the one that finishes you." Peter claimed.

# Chapter 1951 Fate Of The Universe




Filming the outcome there were multiple times where AJ was tempted to press the live button. A press of a single button and an alert would go out to all of his viewers, and from there the news would spread like fire.

Since this was something to do with the celestials, there was no doubt in his mind that every person that was able to tune in to the event would do so.

However, his will to keep his promise had kept him in line, and the fact that he was able to film everything in the first place was good enough.

'If I'm actually honest, I'm more scared of what Chris and the others would do to me if they ever found out.' AJ gulped.

The thing was, AJ wasn't the only one watching the event, because in the celestial space, there were many that had their eyes glued onto what was happening.

While watching the fight, there were many that thought Gorgath had the fight in the bag. After all, the target was the god slayer Erin. He had overwhelmed her in every way, the troublesome ones were the side ones that were getting involved in the fight.

There were quite a few that recognized the marking of Immortui. The older celestials knew his marking well and shivers were sent running through their body.

They thought that perhaps it wasn't such a good idea for Gorgath to continue fighting, especially if Immortui was involved. Regardless, the fight continued anyway, and in the end, Gorgath had lost, and it was mainly due to the dedicated follower.

There was silence for a few moments, as everyone was taking in what had happened. They were also waiting for some type of announcement as such but there was no such thing.

"What does this mean for us?" one of the celestials asked.

"What do you mean, what does this mean for us?"

"Mundus was the one that gave the order right? So the Ancient Ones were the ones that sent out the celestials to get rid of the god slayers. Not only did they fail the task, but not a single one of them survived.

"Does this now mean that the rest of the celestials will be mobilized, to take out the god slayers?"

It was a comment that many thought of, but it felt strange to them. They were beings that always oversaw multiple lives. Utilizing all of the celestials like so, made it feel more like they were going into a war.

If that was the case, it would have been the first of its kind. The celestials had fights with each other, because they were beings of the same level, but the god slayers were only meant to be a small problem. It just felt awkward going into a full out war with the lives they were overseeing.

"I'm not so concerned about that." another celestial added. "I'm more concerned with the dedicated follower getting involved. Did you see the marking on his head?

"This is twice now where a celestial has teamed up with a god slayer to fight against another celestial and this time it's not just any other celestial. I fear that the past may repeat itself, and the fact that we still have yet to hear from Mundus about this, makes me fear the worst."

There were only a few in the room that felt the gravity from the celestial's words, a few that had experience and made it out of what had occured in the past.

A repeat would be disastrous for the balance of the world again, and the time it would take to build a community of celestials once more like this would take another eternity.

The celestials stayed where they were, continuing to watch the outcome of what was to occur, because that was when Xox noticed something and couldn't help but speak out loud.

"That… the one that finished off the celestial, I'm sure of it, he is a dedicated follower as well. A dedicated follower of BB!"

Xox had been watching all of the fights carefully unlike the others, keeping updated with everything, and he had been trying to keep an eye on BB as much as possible as he moved from planet to planet.

In a sense he had put many of the clues together.

"What are you saying, that BB and Immortui are working together since both of their dedicated followers killed one of us?" One of them asked.

"Let me ask, does it really look that way to you?" Xox replied back. "If you see the look in his eyes, it looks like these guys are about to fight each other.

"Maybe you guys don't know as much about the Earthlings as I do, but there is a reason why Immortui has been able to gather a large amount of celestial energy without having to do much to get involved. Because if you leave humans be, there is a good chance that they might just get rid of each other anyway."

When looking at the two groups again, standing opposite each other, and the energy that was radiating off them, it certainly didn't look like they were friends. Making the celestials think, just what had happened for the situation to have turned this way anyway?

What was the relationship between the new troublesome celestial BB and Immortui?

"You don't have to be worried." a heavy vibrating voice spread throughout the area, and turning to where it was coming from they could see a physical form rather than an energy form in the celestial space, which was something that only the Ancient Ones and Mundus, the messenger, could do.

"I have come here to calm your worries." Mundus stated. "After witnessing the first few celestials falling to their demise. I had a feeling that this outcome would be possible.

"Which is why we made a deal. None of you need to worry about this matter. The new celestial BB, has been given the task, the task to eliminate the god slayers."

A lot of positive energy and talk were being spread in the space hearing this news, but Yongbu and Xox weren't so sure as they looked at each other.

Based on their meetings with BB, and his actions in the celestial space before, was he really the type of person that a deal could be struck with? BB seemed more like the stubborn type that would do what he wished to get his way.

If BB didn't listen to them before, why would there be a sudden change of heart, it just didn't make sense to them.

On top of that, if BB really was contacted and a deal had been made, then where even was BB in the first place? Either way, one thing was true in all of this, and it was the fact that BB's dedicated follower showed the highest resistance to the god slayer on the field so maybe it was true.

After delivering the message Mundus turned around and walked back to wherever it was he was going.

'Quinn, I have a feeling you will make the right choice. You had a hint of my power, and what the Ancient Ones can do is far more devastating. All you need to do is take out one person. To stop a war, to stop chaos from spreading everywhere.

'As long as one side is far more superior than the other, a war will never start. A balance of power is what causes wars, and your power is great enough to either balance the scales or completely tip them. So make the right decision.'

——

Right at that moment, Quinn, Fex, Minny and the soul of Alex were travelling towards the said planet in question, the one where chaos was starting to unfold.

"How long until we arrive?" Fex asked, the console at the front.

"Approximate time till destination, 30 minutes and counting." The ship replied.

"30 minutes." Quinn repeated as he sat in his chair and nervously tapped his finger on the side of his arm. "I know what Peter is like. I doubt that he would have waited for our arrival which means Chris would have been dragged along as well."

"Of course," Fex replied. "I think he will be able to hold out, I don't think you have to worry. Honestly, the one I worry about is you Quinn.

"You tell me you have made the resolution, but I fear you did not. I know you knew Erin before you even knew me. So you must have a stronger history there. So if it comes to it, and you really can't do it, but know it must be done, I will have the blood of her fall on my hands instead."

Quinn didn't reply, but he knew it was time for him to decide, in 30 minutes he had to make a choice.

'Which quest path is the best choice.'

# Chapter 1952 Don't Say His Name!




A little before Peter had entered the scene, he was busy dealing with another troublesome person.

After Flora had been whacked away by Gorgath the Celestial, she had been caught by none other than the great wight Peter. He had his hands on her shoulders, gripping on to them tightly with a great amount of pressure, at any second, if he wanted to he could squeeze and shatter the other's shoulders.

"You got away from me before, but don't think for a second that you'll get away from me this time." Peter smiled.

Figuring out who it was holding her, a sense of fear had entered the entirety of Flora's body. Without thinking, she started to swing the large sword in her hand.

Mid-swing, what she was seeing had suddenly changed, as she was seeing the ground and the sky, all of it was upside down. It was only then that she realized that she was currently in the air.

Before she knew it, Peter had lifted her entire body up, and then slammed it right into the ground. She coughed out a large chunk of blood, squinting her eyes as she was in pain.

It was hard for her to tell which blow had hurt her more, the one from the celestial or the one from Peter.

"You stupid girl, I already kicked your arse once, and you try swing that sword at me?" Peter asked, as he looked at her hand and lifted his foot. "This sword, it doesn't even belong to you, so let me get rid of it."

Peter slammed his foot down, right on Flora's fingers, her hand indented into the ground and for sure the bones had been smashed even with her using the second stage of Qi to protect them.

"Let go of the damned sword, it doesn't even belong to you." Peter shouted as he twisted his foot, causing more pain to run through the dhampir's body.

Eventually, her fingers no longer worked, they were completely crumpled, twisted, and almost like nothing but dust, even the skin on them looked to have been rubbed off from Peter.

Kicking the sword away, Peter looked back at Flora.

"You, and your friend, have caused us a lot of trouble. Unfortunately for you, Quinn won't care if you die, and I'm not letting you get away again!"

Peter made a fist, and powerd it up with celestial energy. Now that he had more of it, he was able to just transform part of his body rather than his whole body.

HIs right arm started to glow a bright red, and the strange black substance started to form over his arm, making a slight armour while lava like veins could still be seen running from his fist, up to his elbow.

It was clearly a blow to finish things off unlike the attack that Peter had used before. Moving it an inch, a furry hand moved out, stopping it in its tracks, and a shockwave of power was sent out.

"Stop!" Chris said, as the shape of his eyes had slightly changed. He was gritting his teeth and although was trying to hide it, stopping Peter's punch was a bit troublesome for him.

'He has a lot more power than I thought, but I should have known as much if he was able to beat that celestial from before. It makes sense.' Chris thought.

"What are you doing, she is the enemy, and if we let her live she will just cause more problems for us in the future… just like before." Peter claimed.

Chris gave out a big sigh.

"I understand, but I'm doing this for Quinn, and the rest of your damned gang. I know you might not care so much about what happend to Erin, and the cause of all of this, but I bet he and the others do.

"Quinn has the determination to finish off Erin, but after that, then what happens? Quinn would have to live with the guilt, and the mystery of never knowing why Erin has acted the way she has suddenly now, and trust me I want to kill Erin, without thinking about it just as much as the other guy.

"But Leo… and all the rest that she has hurt, they deserve to know an answer and one of the most likely people to have or know an answer is her, the dhampir that has been by her side since the beginning."

Having spent some time with Peter, Chris knew that he was the hardest to convince when it came to things like this, but there was one person he was willing to do things for, and that was Quinn.

If Peter thought it would be better for Quinn and could see that, it was most likely that he would listen and follow. From the looks of things, since Peter's arm was reverting back to what it was, it had gotten through.

"Fine." Peter said walking past Chris and standing direclty above Flora who hadn't moved from her postion, she felt like her life had just been saved and if she was to do anything stupid it would be taken in a second.

"If she really is that important, then that just means that we can't let her go, no matter what."

Kneeling down, Peter held onto both of Flora's legs, and with a smooth single motion, a loud snap was heard from them both, followed by a slight scream from Flora's mouth.

"My legs, you broke my legs!" Flora screamed at the top of her lungs.

"If we didn't need your mouth I would rip out your tongue and lips in a second, as well." Peter suggested, telling her in his own way for her to shut up. "If you think about using your powers or Qi to heal these legs of yours, I will snap them again, and break them in more places than one.

"Or maybe I should just keep breaking them over and over again until you no longer have the energy to heal."

The threat was enough for Flora to stay quiet and she wouldn't attempt to heal her body. She was already worn out from the fighting and the wounds she had gotten anyway.

"We will keep an eye on her as well." Jessica nervously said, not wanting to step on the toes of Peter after what she had seen.

Lucas had also gone ahead and picked up the sword from the ground as it looked like it was something important, he could feel its power but not really appreciate it for what it was, since he had no clue what a legendary item it was that he was holding.

They continued to watch the fight, and it looked like it was coming to its climax, which led to Peter saying a few words.

"About what you said earlier, well, why are we waiting. We can just ask the B*tch in question why she has gone mad!" Peter claimed as he ran off, and appeared directly behind Gorgath.

After finishing off Gorgath, it didn't take long for Chris to appear by Peter's side, and he did so in a partially transformed state.

Fur had appeared by the side of his face, making him look like he had a heavy set of side burns, and fur was partially on his chest and down the side of his arms.

Chris had already taken off his shirt revealing his body and abs, since he never really wore one when fighting in the first place.

"So you followed me all the way here, huh? Wow I didn't realise you guys were so desperate to get killed." Erin smirked, looking a bit drained, as she held up her sword.

Meanwhile Zero walked ahead, and looked straight at Chris.

"I knew this day would come, the day where you would be on the other side, rather than by mine." Zero said.

"The other side?" Chris replied. "You talk like I was the one that changed sides, when you are the one working with the very person that killed your so-called dear pupil.

"You Zero, have gone mad due to a promise with a god that you don't even know. A promise that you're not even sure would work."

Zero shook his head.

"You are now the one getting in the way of me bringing them back, my whole family, but don't worry. I shall finish you, and bring you back as well, and then you can understand."

In the end, it looked like Chris was unable to avoid a fight.

"Peter, are you ready?" Chris asked.

Peter was about to answer when he could see Erin open her mouth.

"I don't see your friend anywhere. Where is that despicable friend of yours?"

Peter was holding himself back, because he remembered what had happened last time.

"You know who I'm talking about, where is Quinn? I want to see him." Erin smiled.

"You…" Peter's entire body was shaking, and the energy was taking him over as he began his transformation into his celestial form. "DON'T HAVE PERMISSION TO SAY HIS NAME!"

*****

# Chapter 1953 Magic And Science




Peter was already in his fully transformed state as he burst forward and ran across the field to get to the other's side. Although Peter looked the same in his current form as he did before, it was clear to Chris that the energy surrounding him was certainly different.

When the two of them had fought against the celestial before, the last punch that Peter had delivered had a large amount of celestial points, given by Quinn in the final moments.

The only thing was Quinn had never returned those celestial points, and right now, Peter had well over a 100,000 celestial points. Giving him enough energy that would rival actual celestials.

As Peter ran, a radiating red aura was following him, looking almost like a copy of himself just delayed by a fraction of a second. When he got close to the others, Peter leapt in the air and threw a punch on his way down.

Erin swung her sword from below with a perfect measure of time. Although Peter was fast, Erin's actions and eyes could keep up with it. This was something she could always do due to the flow of energy she could see.

People's energy was more honest than they were, allowing her to recognize what someone was going to do before they would do it, allowing her to keep up with even those that were faster than her.

"I'll chop your arm right off!" Erin screamed, as the sword clashed against Peter's arm.

Rather than cutting through it like she expected though, the sword stopped as it hit the strange black outer-casing that Peter had on his arms.

"Die B*tch!" Peter shouted back as his special head tail twisted and went right for a stab. Quickly skimming her sword off from Peter's arm, she knocked the head tail away from piercing her armour.

The head tail continued to attempt to stab her, and stepping back a few steps, Erin would move the large sword's position slightly, stopping the stab attacks from reaching her in time, one after another.

'This woman, I thought she was struggling against the celestial before, so why is she doing well against me?' Peter thought. 'My attacks should be sending her to the moon, yet she is matching me back in strength, just like the time before.'

Blocking the head tail from attacking again, it was now moving considerably slower compared to what it was before. Peter tried to twist the tail and noticed that it was slightly frozen.

'The sword's power, she's been using it this whole time, bit by bit to freeze my head tail.'

"You might have gotten better at fighting, stronger in your hits, and faster, but still after all this time, you don't think when you're fighting!" Erin twisted the handle on the sword, and the first ring lit up.

Swinging it downward, a whole tunnel of flames had hit Peter, sending him back. An intense heat was felt all over his body, and Erin could hear yelling but was unable to see anything. Using her ability instead, she could see Peter's energy through the flames.

The tunnel was still swirling around his body, yet the flames were no longer pushing Peter back, and instead he was coming right towards her instead.

Jumping right through, Peter had thrown out a fist again, and it had hit Eirn right on the chest. Sending her crashing back and bouncing off the ground, until she had flipped herself in the air from a bounce and landed on her feet holding her chest.

The armour wasn't damaged, but the blow was still felt having gone through it slightly.

"So what!" Peter shouted. "It's worked for me so far, and it will work for me now as well."

——

Not too far away from where Peter and Erin had started their fight, Chris and Zero were standing opposite each other around ten metres away. Neither of them had made the first move yet.

"What's wrong?" Zero eventually spoke. "You managed to summon up the will to go against me, but when reality sinks in, and push comes to shove, you can't attack me?"

Chris didn't know what to say, he was still in his partially transformed Werewolf like state. His breathing was slightly heavier in this form.

"You should know you won't succeed." Chris spoke. "There is no need for us to fight, if your task is already going to fail."

Zero laughed as he kept his sword in his sheath and took a step forward. It was the same stance that he had taken when he was ready to fight out against Gorgath.

"And who is going to stop me, that crazy undead man? You? I was the one that made you as strong as you are today, do you really think that I would willingly make you stronger than me?

"I had a hunch that you might turn on me one day, to disagree with my methods. There is a saying that if you want things done, then you need to do them yourself, but please feel free to stay and do nothing, because right about now, Agent 4 will be completing the long and awaited task that had been given to me by him, then finally I will get my wish."

Hearing these words, Chris knew he had to act, he had to stop Agent 4 from doing whatever it was he was doing. His claws elongated, his legs bulged and grew in size as Chris launched from his position, reaching Zero, who pulled out the sword from his sheath.

"150,000 soul Qi strike!"

At the same time Chris swung his hand.

'I know his ability, even if I dodge this attack, it will hit me regardless, so the best thing to do, when fighting against Zero, is to go head to head, and in this body, that's the best thing for me!'

The large furry arm struck right against the sword, and a glow appeared between the two strikes of power. Both of them using immense amounts of Qi.

Zero's strike had more Qi due to all of those that he had absorbed over the years, while Chris had his physical strength and his Werewolf form to back him up.

The two strikes of power created a large ball of energy that engulfed the two of them inside. Not allowing for the bystanders that were watching, anything to see about what was going on.

"The amount of power in these fights." Jessica commented. "If they were fighting on Earth, I fear that the whole planet would have been destroyed."

The others knew what she meant, most of the time, these great energies in their attacks were just hitting each other, their own bodies, so it was hard to tell how much power was behind each strike.

But if these attacks were directed towards the planet, towards destruction of the planet, it would be a simple thing for these people to do.

It was a good thing they were on this planet as well, since the ground was harder. This planet certainly was a special place, to harbour so many demon tier beasts and still have land that had survived.

——

In a different location, but on the same planet, Agent 4 had finally reached his destination. The strange device that he had brought with him showed that the energy readings in this particular area were going drastically up and then settling back down.

Currently, he was on a peak of a relatively small mountain. The spire at the top didn't pierce the clouds or anything like that, but instead it was a special point.

Standing at the top, looking towards one area of the planet, lightning could be seen striking the ground constantly. In another section, large amounts of lava were spewing from the floor, heavy rain in the next and so on.

The planet was a strange one, but at this point, it was calmer than ever, yet one could see all of the chaos that was going on everywhere else.

'This is it, the point where it connects with the other realms of the celestials. I can feel it, even the red heart is radiating in and out with power.' Agent 4 thought.

'There was a reason why we chose this planet in the first place, and this is the location where Immortui told us to put the red heart.'

On the top of the mountain there was quite the flat surface, and carrying the red heart, Agent 4 placed it down. After that he pulled out a piece of white chalk.

"Look at me, a man of science dabbling in magic. Although Zero passed on the secret of immortality to me. He has allowed me to stay in this world for as long as I wish through the Qi drain.

"So, I will do as he asks, and return the favour."

Smiling, Agent 4 began to draw a circle around the red heart, and started to draw the shapes and symbols that he had been told to memorize.

# Chapter 1954 Stolen Power




Now that there were two fights going on at once, AJ was trying his best to film both of them without getting his equipment destroyed, Even though the drones had gone through improvements, allowing them to survive through storms, a high degree of heat and so on, there was always a chance for them to break.

In the past, they had broken and they had been improved upon, but a single direct hit from any of these four fighting and he knew he would lose his precious footage.

'It's a good thing that all of the recorded footage automatically backs up onto a server so I will never lose it, but these drones cost an arm and a leg. I guess I just have to be careful.'

Most of the drones that were being used were covering Peter's and Erin's fight, but the direct camera that AJ was using, he was focusing on Chirs and Zero.

Using his ability, he was running around getting the perfect shots and getting in and out of the range of their fighting. Shockwaves from the attacks from before would hit him now and then, but he just had to suck it up and continue on.

The large ball of energy that was covering the two of them had started to disappear, yet strong shock waves were still coming out from the area, and several loud bangs afterwards.

Now that he could see, AJ could tell that the fight was still going on between the two of them. Sword was clashing against claws, and a display like no other of physical and sword mastery was being put on.

A swing from Chris's claw went right for Zero's face, before it was knocked away and hit to the side. Although it looked like there was nothing on Chris's hands and it was just a normal swing, five large lines appeared in the ground not too far away from where they were fighting.

Seeing another strike, Zero swirled around to the side of Chris trying to move away, but knew it wouldn't be quite enough. With his other hand free, he threw it out.

A strong invisible force was felt that had pushed Chris slightly away. It didn't hurt him in any way, but just moved him slightly out of position.

'The third stage of Qi… Zero is probably the most skilled person in the world, and the one with the most amount of Qi right now. I have to think of all the possibilities he can do when fighting with Qi!'

Just as Chris turned back around to face Zero, he could see a large slash of Qi heading his way.

"100,000 Soul Qi strike!"

The attack had hit Chris's chest, piercing him slightly, before the attack could go any deeper, he let out a large howl, and used both of his hands, almost ripping the strike apart.

Chris's face started to transform even more, elongating and looking less like a human and more like a Werewolf. The next moment, the attack was shattered.

"I see now that you have no problems with killing me, and that I should be the same!" Chris shouted in anger.

Bracing himself, Zero quickly threw out two strikes behind him with his sword. It looked almost like he was displaying some type of move set, as he swung his sword here and there, and other places, while shooting out the aura of Qi yet none of them were directed at Chris.

Holding his sword steady, it lit up pink now compared to before and he stood there waiting for the other to attack.

Out of anger, with another howl, Chris started to swing his arms, in the air several lines of energy, like a large scratch mark appeared in the air, and were heading straight for Zero.

Condensing the energy, to only be used in his sword, Zero swung it, breaking right through the energy claw marks. Swinging again and again, Zero broke one after another with his sword.

However, the attacks were strong, as each time the attack hit, even though he was breaking them, he was being moved back, further and further.

Although Zero's sword and Qi were doing well against the attacks, his arms were feeling a bit heavy and numb from the attacks.

When the barrage of attacks were finally over, Zero looked forward and noticed Chris was no longer there.

"Turn around!" Chris shouted, as he pulled Zero's shoulder so the front of his body was facing him, and before Zero could react, Chris delivered a strong large fist right to his stomach hitting him in the air.

Before Zero could get away from Chris, he leapt up, now above him. Zero had spun around desperately throwing out sword strikes of Qi here and there, but with a slight tilt of his head, Chris was able to avoid it.

With both of his hands held together, Chris then slammed it down, right on top of Zero's body, sending him crashing into the ground.

"I know your Qi is strong, I know your second stage and first stage will protect from all of that. There is a lot more that I need to do to finish you off!"

Swinging his arms again, the claws of energy went straight to where Zero crashed into,. They started to rip into the ground, and were shaking the whole floor around them each time the attacks hit.

'I know he has a lot of Qi, but he just got off from fighting the celestial. If I keep attacking him, eventually his second stage Qi barrier should be down.

'The smart thing to do after that, is leave the first stage of Qi to empower the body and heal the wounds, once all of that Qi is gone as well, he won't be able to attack anymore.

'I will make this a fight about who will last longer, and if that is the case then my Werewolf body will win!'

AJ, who continued to film it all, couldn't believe the display of powers that were being put on right now. The reason why he had personally been filming Chris's and Zero's fight was because he thought it made a better headline at the end of the day.

The two top leaders of Pure going head to head, a display of Pure powers, it was a pun headline, but sometimes it needed to be done.

The attacks were relentless from Chris as he continued to swing his arms in the air, each time chucking out a claw of energy. At first there was quite a bit of dust from the original set of attacks.

Something strange then started to occur, the ground was no longer shaking, even though Chris was still attacking even at this moment. The dust around the area was starting to settle, which was allowing them to see what was going on.

As it did, a sight that no one expected had occurred, even Chris had a sweat on the side of his face but continued to swing his arms as he watched this.

Standing in the crater, Zero had his hand held up, and around a metre away from his body, all of the strikes that Chris were throwing were just hitting into a type of invisible wall.

It looked like there was a type of barrier that was around Zero, one that didn't allow any of Chris's attacks to touch him.

"You have a superhuman body that can heal nearly anything, you have great strength, speed, and a ridiculous amount of Qi. These things are even things that I wish I had.

"However, I would have never subjected myself to become something like you. I would feel less like myself. I wish to do everything with my own strength." Zero claimed.

"Own strength!'' Chris shouted as he gave out a bigger swing than before, and a large claw strike went straight towards Zero.

It hit the strange barrier just like before, but this time there was a slight squint in Zero's eyes and a bend in his knees.

"Your own power? You mean all your power that you stole from others. Have you really sunk so far that you don't even realise that?" Chris shouted.

"Do you see anyone by my side right now?" Zero replied. "This is my own power!" Moving his hand away, Zero started to run, moving away from Chris's claw strikes.

While running he was swinging his blade once again, not aiming for Chris, but just aiming in his general direction as he swung and swung.

Chris landed on the ground, and was ready to go toe to toe with Zero once again, but that's when of all people, AJ noticed something.

'No… why didn't I notice it sooner… what Zero was trying to do?' AJ thought.

*****

# Chapter 1955 A Powerful Wolf




AJ was so engrossed in the fight that he was unable to notice what had been happening so far, the subtle things that a particular person was doing so far. It was only now that he was watching the fight through the camera that he was able to see things from a much wider perspective.

'If only I noticed sooner, if I told Chris, then he might have been able to come out of this one top.' AJ told himself.

Although, thinking about it more, would it really have been much help, how would AJ even communicate the trouble that he could see from so far away, without disturbing or distracting Chris?

'All I can do now is pray that you get through this, you are the hope of this group in the end.' AJ thought.

Landing on the ground, Chris was still confident, the fact that Zero had created a barrier of what he could only suspect was Qi, meant that he was draining Zero out, bit by bit.

'This is good, there is no need for me to use the fourth stage, nor is there the need for me to transform completely into a wolf. This body uses the least amount of energy allowing me to be at my strongest, and is the best at healing itself.

'This fight, I can win this one.'

Zero continued to run around the place swinging his sword, bit by bit, and that's when Chris went directly towards him once again. Two large strikes of energy, went toward Chris but had missed him as Chris moved from side to side, easily avoiding the attacks.

He jumped one way, then the other, and with the third jump, headed straight toward Zero.

"Where are you trying to hit!" Chris yelled, as he bashed Zero with both his hands, but had hit nothing but the blade, sending him back.

"I thought I mentored you better than this, in all honesty, I never thought that, out of everything, that this would be your downfall!" Zero stated. "Be aware of your surroundings!"

Zero had placed his sword in the sheath again, which meant he would be storing up power for a large attack. However, if that was the case, then it meant Zero had to be confident that Chris was unable to attack or touch him. Seeing this was ringing alarm bells in his head, and made him not step forward for a second.

Instead, Chris started to look around, to see if there was any kind of trap that had been set up.

"A little too slow, don't you think?" Zero chuckled.

"This… what do I do?" Chris thought

Now, when looking around in the air, there were several Qi strikes all over in the air. They were there just hovering in place and floating about. This was all due to Zero's ability.

His ability, which allowed him to hit his target no matter what, but it also allowed him to control his attacks, a bit like how vampires could use blood control.

His Qi attacks were floating in place, just waiting for Zero's ability to be activated on Chris, and at any moment, no matter what, these fifty or so powerful Qi strikes would all come toward Chris at once, hitting him no matter what.

"You… fine, bring it on!" Chris shouted.

Stretching his arms out by his side and spreading his legs, Chris had seen Zero's ability and he knew that there was no chance for him to run away. The best thing to do was to face them head on.

"Let's see, how you do." Zero stated, as his ability was activated and all of the strikes now were moving towards Chris, from every possible angle.

Some of the attacks were a little behind others, so they wouldn't be hitting him at the same time, and that was what Chris needed to rely on. As the aura came in and struck him, he swung his arms at two of them, as hard as he could, aiming to equal out the attack.

He had done a good job but it was pointless, at the same time several slashes had hit his legs, hit his back, hit the other parts of his body. The slashes were piercing his tough hide, going through the Qi that he had.

'I have to… I have to fight this!' Chris thought, as he looked up into the sky, and let out a large howl of energy.

"WHOOOOO!" Chris shouted, trying to activate all of the Qi in his body to reinforce it. In his werewolf form, it was better to use the first stage of Qi, to improve his body capabilities rather than the second stage as a barrier.

All he could hope for was to minimise the damage of the attacks and increase the healing of his body.

However, the slashes of energy continued, there wasn't just one wave, but there seemed to be several more waves of attacks. They were piercing through his skin, pushing him back, his body trying to heal as the slashes of power hit the inside of him.

"ARGHHHH!!!" Chris continued to scream. "I can't lose here, I can't die here. Not when I have finally just started to live."

Chris began to swing his hand, trying to destroy the Qi attacks coming towards him, he was taking a step forward as more slashes were hitting him, still piercing his body and his blood was dripping on the floor.

"Come on Chris!" AJ shouted. "The whole world is counting on you, take out this damned fake!"

Chirs swung his hand, but got hit by ten more slashes that were just directed toward his arm as well. He was sure by now the attacks had to be over, only a few more seconds at least.

"Just starting to live?" Zero repeated. "Don't worry, after I am done with you here. I promise I will bring you back, and then you will see the light, and see how right I was!"

Unleashing his sword out from his sheath, Zero threw out a devastating attack.

"160,000 soul Qi strike!" Zero shouted.

The line of aura that came out was larger, more condensed and powerful compared to before. On top of that, straight after, Zero swung his sword a few more times, throwing more of the Qi strikes, but with lesser energy, out towards Chris.

The attacks were still hitting Chris non stop, but he could see the large attack coming his way.

'I have to focus on stopping this, if I don't stop this one, it will be a real problem. I have to.'

Chris thought, as he readied both of his hands, he concentrated his Qi moving it to his hands, but in doing so, the other attacks were able to pierce his body deeper than they would have done.

Regardless, Chris didn't flinch, he didn't run, because any of these types of thoughts would just make things worse.

"If I'm going to that damned place, then I will at least take you with me!" Chris shouted, throwing both of his fists together hitting the attack from Zero at the right time.

It stopped it in its tracks, breaking the attack. Showing that Chris was no weaker in terms of power. However, the following attacks had hit Chris, right on his chest and following that, with his energy low, he was chucked onto the ground and fell over backwards.

The attacks had stopped, but with all of the cuts, covering nearly every inch of Chris's body, it was hard to believe he was still alive, yet he still got up off the ground with blood dripping from his wounds.

"Chirs…" AJ couldn't help but call out, and an overwhelming amount of emotions were coming over him. "You can… stop Chris, you don't have to get up again, you have done enough, you have already fought so hard."

"Look at us." Zero said. "There is still not a single wound on my body. I know what your plan was. With your strength you were planning to outlast me. After the last fight, you probably thought I was low on Qi.

"If I just ran out of Qi, and you were able to land a few hits on me the fight would be over right? Although that was a good train of thought to have.

"As you can tell I still have plenty of power."

Chris coughed, and a large chunk of thick blood and mucus came out onto the floor.

"How many, how many more lives did you take behind my back to have this much power?" Chris said. "I can't believe, for so long I worked for a monster like you. I was wrong about you… and I was wrong about trying to out last you. So it's time to just go all out."

A ball of energy looked to be summoning out of Chris's chest. His wounds weren't healing fast anymore, and he was still in his werewolf form, but something strange was starting to happen as the energy from his chest spread out through his entire body.

HIs skin, no, not only his skin, but the grey fur all over his body, was starting to turn red.

"Stage 4 Qi, with my werewolf form, using both of my powers at its maximum potential. It might take every last single drop of energy from my body… but now I can see that's what it will take to beat you!"

Seeing this, AJ had never seen such a beautiful sight before, a red werewolf.

# Chapter 1956 Flying The Distance




Peter and Erin's fight was in no way a comfortable one for either of them. Although Peter now had a lot more celestial energy than last time, which powered him up in a certain way, it didn't do much against Erin. Even though he had landed a full-blown hit right on her, it was clear that she was fine, and he would have to try harder if he wished to get the upper hand in this battle.

However, if there was one thing that Peter was, it was relentless, as he didn't give her a second to recover and had already resumed raining down his fists upon her, throwing them one after another before she could even react.

"Your body probably still hasn't even fully healed yet, and yet you are trying to attack me!" Keeping the sword in its flame state, Erin felt the need to do more damage.

While the ice sword would perhaps slow down the intensity of Peter's attacks, she knew it wouldn't do much in terms of dealing actual damage to him. Thus swinging her sword, she tried to hit the skin of Peter's knuckles.

It was still impossible for her sword to cut through the strange black substance that Peter had covering his knuckles with for some reason, but the flames coming from each strike would do something as they twirled from the sword and were directed right towards Peter's chest, pushing him back slightly every time.

'The sword only emits flames when swung, but if I use the third stage of Qi, I can redirect the flames to more vital points and continue to hurt Peter in this way,' Erin quickly thought of a plan.

However, just like before, Peter didn't seem to care about the flames that were burning on his body, and he threw out two fists at the same time, firing them off like a shotgun--full of power and might.

There was only one way Erin could think of to block this attack. Therefore, while swinging her sword again to skim both of Peter's arms, she herself leapt up into the air through the momentum of the sword.

'Damn it. This undead can use Qi as well. Even if I had blocked the attack, the power and shockwave would have still hit me. Since when did he get so smart?'

The thing was, Peter wasn't thinking about what he was doing at all, he had only one thought on his mind, and that was the fuel behind his aggression.

'Kill.. kill... kill... I need to kill her. That way, Quinn won't have to. If I get rid of her here, then he won't have any guilt for doing so. I have to do this, I must take her down!'

While in the air, Erin had forgotten about a small detail. The head-tail raised up and whacked her right on the side of her armour where her ribs would be.

The strike from the head-tail was just as strong as if Peter himself was swinging a sword. Before her body could be flung off to the side, he grabbed her by the foot and swung her by her ankle, slamming her right onto the ground, creating a sizable crater from the impact.

"I'm not done yet!" Peter shouted as he lifted her by the foot again, ready to slam her into another area of the ground. But suddenly, Peter felt like he was no longer holding anything, and as he finished his motion, there was nothing in his hands.

"Where did she go?" Peter thought as he looked around.

Looking at his hand, he still didn't understand. He had a tight grip and was sure she hadn't gotten out of it, and yet she had somehow managed to slip through.

"You people are annoying. In fact, it seems like you and Chris are the only annoying ones that are currently here, so I guess it won't be that big of a problem," Erin said, "You are strong, but I can tell this is the limit to your strength. You have no trump card and nothing through which you can use to turn the situation around. Whereas for me, it's different. You haven't even forced me to the limit."

Right now, Erin was sitting on top of a large black horse with a strange greenish-blue glow coming out from its body and its nostrils. Aj and the other vampires were wondering where it had come from, they had no clue what this Horse was, but that wasn't the case for Peter. He knew.

"I was wondering when you were going to use them," Peter gritted his teeth as he curled his hand into his fist.

Without a doubt, this was one of the four kings that he had seen before, and Erin had control of all four of them. There was still a lot more that Peter needed to do in this fight if he wanted to win.

For Erin, the four kings were something that she had refused to use in the fight against the celestial. She had learned multiple times that she always needed something to protect her.

If the past was anything to go by, she had seen time and time again how people would die, so she would never fully overexert herself and leave herself open if she had to.

If it came to it, she would even try and run away from a fight before using all of her energy. With Peter in front of her though, Erin had concluded if she wanted to get rid of him, she only needed to use a bit more strength. She would still have room and power to get rid of the rest of them safely.

As for Peter, he knew Erin was right. He didn't have any trump cards. He just had his fist that he needed to rely on. There was one thing that could help him, but they had left it back on the ship.

Laxmus, in the end, was a lesser Wight, but he was someone who still carried his vampire energy. It was a debate beforehand about whether to bring him into the battle or not, and in the end, Peter decided against it.

This was due to who they were going up against: Erin. She was someone who gained power from fighting vampires. He was unsure if Laxmus's dead body would do the same thing, but it wasn't worth the risk, which meant that he would have to fight this battle on his own to win.

"You should have just stayed in whatever hole you were hiding in for the last thousand years!" Erin shouted.

The Horse started to run towards Peter. It was moving its legs swiftly and would almost turn invisible once in a while.

Peter had locked his eyes on its movement, but not just the Horse, but Erin herself was disappearing in and out as well.

'Can that Horse make her invisible too? But I don't remember her using this power before.'

When thinking back, the Horse hardly did much of anything, apart from fighting with Oscar with its full force and strength. The full capabilities of its powers weren't really revealed, and who knew if the King's strength from the families grew with time? If this was the case, then this certainly would be a tough battle.

Right then, Peter threw a fist, aiming right for the Horse, but it disappeared the next second, making him hit nothing but the air, and before he knew it, a large cut was made across his back.

"Peter!" Vanessa cried. She had been watching everything carefully so far.

----

Inside the ship, there were Chris, Peter, and the others who had landed not long ago. Laxmus was still in a room, his eyes open. To a degree, Peter could control his Lesser Wights and give them orders and such.

However, it was clear that Laxmus was different from the other Lesser Wights that he created. For one, it still could use vampire aura, nearly just as strong as it could before.

On top of that, Peter never did have to give it many commands or directions on how to fight. All of those things it just tended to do itself, which was why, now of all times, Laxmus had strangely made a move.

It turned its head toward a certain direction, and its eyes glowed slightly red. The next second it opened its wide mouth, gathering the red energy, and let out a small blast breaking right through the ship's walls.

Flapping its wings, it started to take off, going through the whole it had just made. It stayed still in its place in the air for a few seconds. Once again, its head had turned in a certain direction as if it was searching for something or someone.

Moments later, Laxmus flew away into the distance.

*****

# Chapter 1957 Heal No More




A large black object with horrifying wings and a mauled face with a large hole in its chest, was flying through the air. The movement of its heavy wings showed how strong such a creature this was.

It was hard for anyone who hadn't seen Laxmus's true form to believe it was him, but since Peter had resurrected him, this form was a permanent one for him.

Currently, without any order from Peter, it was flying through the air, heading toward a certain destination. Right now, it was flying with a mind of its own as something had triggered for it to act.

Suddenly, as it got closer to its destination, its wings flapped harder making it breeze through the air at a great speed, past the lightning strikes, through the great winds, until the area had calmed down again, and Laxmus had reached its destination.

It hovered in the air, looking down, and Laxmus could see it, a red object that was on the peak of the mountain, shining and radiating with power.

However, the object wasn't alone, and due to Laxmus's presence being quite a large one, with the sound of its wings flapping, it caused Agent 4 to look up.

'That… what is that, is it a beast?' Agent 4 guessed.

Opening its mouth, a red aura started to gather, and regardless of whether it was a beast or not, it looked like it was ready to attack.

'I haven't finished drawing the magic circle yet.' Agent 4 still had chalk in his hand, it was nearly done, there were only a few more steps to be completed. If the attack destroyed the peak of the mountain then it would destroy the circle as well.

Without hesitation, Agent 4 stood up, and placed both of his hands in front of him, and just as he thought, a large red beam came straight from the creature's mouth, shooting directly at him.

The crown on top of Agent 4's head started to light up. The attack didn't go past his hands as the red ripples started to be seen in the air.

'This attack, it looks like vampire aura. That's the ugliest vampire I have ever seen, but why has it come here, is it because of the Red heart?'

Agent 4 had never witnessed Laxmus in his true form, so he had no idea who he was, and quite frankly there was another problem he needed to deal with.

Using the blood armour with the crown was easy, and he had an unlimited amount of usage, but this was mainly due to the red heart.

The special blood armour was created for use by kings and high ranking vampires, without something to supplement its powers in some way, it was almost impossible for a human to use it.

The red beam of energy attack had stopped and Agent 4 placed his hands down back by his side.

"I guess it's my fault, being portrayed as the scientist of the Pure faction, many must have thought that I was weak, but there is a reason why Zero trusted me with this task, and I will complete it."

———

While this was going on, Vanessa had just witnessed a large slash on Peter's back, blood had splattered in the air, and it looked to be quite the bad wound.

Having witnessed both Peter and Chris fight on the Graylash planet, she thought that nothing could best the two. After all, they had defeated the fighting and powerful celestial that could have easily killed everyone on the planet.

Yet here they were, still finding those that they were struggling against.

With her familiar, Erin continued onward after striking Peter. She knew his strength and wasn't going to stick around for him to attack back, especially a headstrong person like Peter, who even if he did feel pain would do anything to get a hit in, and she was right.

Immediately, Peter swung his arms backward, with a strong force and amount of energy that the rocks in the area had been kicked up and were flying but had hit nothing.

"I know of your healing capabilities but that wound isn't such a simple wound, it has my Qi infused in it, making it a lot harder to simply just heal." Erin said, still riding on the horse who was moving its hooves ready to charge in once again.

"I am not the same as I was before!" Peter shouted.

Peter had learnt a bit about Qi, he had practiced after Quinn had tried to teach him, but in the end, Peter was too furious to think of the training he had done back then.

Instead he was summoning up massive amounts of celestial energy in his body, and it was burning around him like a giant flame. Expanding the energy in such a way, he wasn't doing anything specific with it, but the celestial energy had started to expel the Qi energy that was in his body that was allowing him to heal. Soon there was no wound on his back at all.

"Fine… it just means this is going to take a little longer!" Erin shouted as the horse was on the move again.

Just like before, as the horse moved it started to glide on the surface, moving at an incredibly fast speed and once in a while it would disappear from sight and then be in a completely different location.

Seeing how he had been hit the last time, he was trying to find the horse, so he dug his fingers into the ground, cracking part of it. Then lifting a large chunk of it, He threw it, and ran forward smashing it up with his fists.

As he hit the large piece of the ground, smaller pieces were going off everywhere in the direction of the horse. Even if the two of them were invisible, as soon as a piece of land hit the horse, Peter was going to get ready to strike again.

He carefully looked, using his eyesight trying to see anything, until right in front of his eyes, Erin and the Horse appeared, and the sword had already stabbed right through Peter's chest.

He held onto the sword, but felt his entire body lifted into the air. While on the sword as well, the first ring of the demon tier weapon activated and a tornado of flames erupted from the sword.

The horse was seen continuing to move but Peter was no longer on the Blade. AJ watching the thing was wondering where the body had gone.

Worried that it might have been burned into nothing but ashes, until hitting the ground and landing back down was Peter.

"Is he dead?" AJ mumbled and gulped, but there was movement.

Peter used both of his hands to get up from the floor, his skin burned, the wound on his chest bleeding slightly. For such a wound, more blood should have been spilling from it, but there was very little.

Once again expending his celestial energy in an explosive way, Peter was getting rid of the Qi from his body, ready to heal.

"I'll keep doing this, until I find a way… a way to stop your little trick. Let's see who tires out first." Peter smiled.

Erin smiled back, welcoming the challenge, and continued forward rather than running straight towards Peter with the horse, she decided to go around in circles this time, disappearing, and when she reappeared the horse was running the opposite direction.

Now, the routes and the ways that she could come toward Peter were endless. Peter threw out loaded fists with bursts of energy and Qi. It uprooted pieces of the ground, and made it look like a train had crashed through the area, yet he was unsuccessful again, as Erin had stabbed him right through the thigh this time.

Due to the celestial energy and hard skin Peter had, Erin realised that she was unable to slash through her opponent, but concentrating her power and Qi, to a single point she was able to stab, and stab was what she would do.

Peter continued to throw out his fists, his legs even, randomly hitting the air, but each time, Erin would find a way to avoid all that, appearing seemingly out of nowhere and stabbing Peter again, again and again.

While Peter repeated, healing himself again, again and again, until… Peter started to feel a hunger. The Qi was removed from his body, but a wound that had been made in his stomach was no longer healing.

Erin hadn't attacked again, she stayed a distance away as she had noticed he was slowing down.

"I knew this would happen, because of my ability I know you better than you know yourself. I can see all of the different energies inside you. You've lost this fight Peter."

Peter tried to muster the strength to stand, but the energy in his entire body was depleted, his form reverted back to normal and he fell to his knees, holding the wound on his stomach.

"I hope you burn in hell, bitch!" Peter said as he collapsed on the floor.

****

# Chapter 1958 The Red Wolf




At the same time as Peter was having the fight of his life, there was another battle to the death that was going on at the same time. The beautiful camera work from AJ was capturing everything on the mystic red Wolf.

Chris was large in size, around 9 feet, he was already tall for a human but in his werewolf form he looked even larger than before. His fur was overflowing, floating in place as it wiggled about in the air. Rather than the light grey colour it was before, it was red as if it had been soaked in blood.

The eyes of Chris were intense, narrow like, and glowing a bright red and unlike before, his face was elongated more like that of a wolf's. During the fight he would make sure his face didn't change too much, making it easier for him to speak, but he was done with speaking, he needed everything he could get.

"So you have decided to use up all the gas in your tank, so you can burn brightly once more. I guess it's the only choice you have!" Zero said as he placed his sword in his sheath, charging up another attack.

Chris lifted his head up to the sky, both of his hands out by his side, which dangled a little below his waist, as they were longer in this form. The hairs on his body were still floating even though there seemed to be no expended energy outside of his body.

It was strange, sometimes when those were summoning the great energy in their body, it would leak out. Effects on the ground beneath their feet, or strange phenomenon would occur such as one's hair standing up on their ends, similar to Chris's hair now.

Yet there was no energy leakage coming out from him, and his hair was still floating about as if it was the case. Suddenly, all of the hairs stopped floating randomly in place as if in water, and started it to move upright, as if they were all pointing towards his head.

Swinging his head down, and swinging his arms out, Chris opened his mouth and let out the biggest howl of his life.

"AHWOOOOOO!"

Just like with the energy in his body, the energy coming out of Chris's mouth was directed straight at a certain individual. The ground was breaking as the howl left Chris's mouth in one direction.

Before Zero could even do anything, it slammed right into him. His clothes ruffled due to the sheer power that was being chucked out toward him.

'This attack is not damaging… my Qi barrier isn't being affected, so what's the point of the howl?' Zero thought.

When Chris had stopped, he pointed both of his clawed hands toward Zero, and ten of his nails shot out from his hands. Condensed forms of energy as fast as bullets.

'This attack might be too strong for my Qi barrier to stop it, so I will just have to strike it down.' Zero thought as he went to pull out his sword, but his hand was stuck.

In fact, that was when he noticed it wasn't just his hand, his whole body was frozen still. No matter how hard he tried, he was unable to move his body, it wasn't listening to him at all.

'Is this because of the howl from earlier? How can this have an effect, is it some sort of human instinct, am I scared?'

It was strange, Zero had never experienced such a thing before and at the same time, Chris had no idea what was happening, because right now, he was just fighting based on pure instinct.

The nails carried on forward and just as Zero had expected, pierced through his 2nd Qi barrier, breaking through the skin and entering his body.

'I can't move my body, but I can move my Qi… These nails, they are aiming right for my chest and heart, if they continue, I will die. I have to focus on the first stage of Qi, and the third stage from within, and push these out.'

All of this was having to be done in milliseconds, otherwise the nails already inside Zero's body would reach his heart. Focusing and swirling the Qi around, finding the points where his body had been pierced, Zero successfully used his Qi to push the nails out of his body.

Still not being able to move, all of the nails rushed out in a random direction hitting the ground, going to the sky and more.

'If I can still use my Qi, then I should be able to use it to command myself. Use the Qi command to get rid of whatever is happening to me right now.'

And that was exactly what Zero did allowing him to move in place, taking his sword out of his sheath. Only haven taken it out a little, the sword was glowing a slight pink but there was nothing Zero could do because Chris was already directly in front of him.

Lifting both of his hands, the claws clashed against the blade of Zero and his whole body was lifted in the sky, causing him to reach the clouds above.

Jumping from his position, Chris continued to chase after Zero. He reached him quickly and with one of his hands swung it as hard as he could aiming directly for the sword.

As it hit, the sword was flung out of Zero's hands breaking the bones in his fingers as the sword fell to the floor. Then without holding back it was time for Chris to go on his rampage.

Swinging his arms, his nails dug through Zero's skin and clothing as if there was no Qi protecting him at all. Deep cuts were made on his body, one after the other.

The only thing Zero could attempt to do was move his arms in the way of his vitals and focus his Qi there, but each time he did this, Chris would simply grab the arm and move it away.

In terms of strength even with the powered up Qi, there was no chance for Zero to out power him.

'I can't die here, not when I was so close, not when I was so close to getting them back!'

Thinking these thoughts, Zero was left with no choice to do the one thing he never wanted to do. The mark on his forehead started to glow brightly.

When Chris swung his clawed hand again, and it hit Zero's body, a clang was heard, he was no longer hitting flesh. The entirety of Zero's body started to be covered in a strange black substance.

"Just like that undead friend of yours with his marking, I can change my form. As I said before to you, I hate using borrowed power. I guess in the end you were right, I am a hypocrite." Zero shouted.

The fight between Peter and Erin had come to an end, with Peter laying on the ground, but just then a large light of energy had appeared in the sky, and a giant shockwave was felt.

AJ moved his camera to the sky to see, due to the energy, the clouds had disappeared and the black clear sky could be seen. Zooming in closely there were two objects falling out of the sky.

Then with a slam, a large spiral of pink energy, like a ring, had been shot out, and one of the objects was slammed into the ground. A wave of dust came out, hitting AJ and blocking the view of the camera.

Zooming into the scene, that's when Chris, no longer in his werewolf form, could be seen lying there, while Zero landed not too far after him, the strange black substance going back into his forehead, with cuts all over his chest, and landing on his two feet.

AJ wasn't the only one that could see this, the two vampires that were with him could as well.

"Does this mean both of them lost… they're not moving right, right?" Vanessa said in a panic. She was still holding onto the special sword, but more so she was worried about what would now happen to them.

"I think… I can hear Chris breathing, so at least he is still alive." Lucas answered. "But I think that both of them are unable to fight, that's for sure."

Although both of them probably had expended a lot of energy fighting the two, there wasn't a bone in Lucas's body that thought he could defeat these two, even in a weakened state.

Looking at the sight and still filming everything, AJ could only do one thing. On his system he had hit the live button, and titled the story, "The final moments of AJ, and the great unknown heroes that tried to save us".

"I don't know what will happen from here… but the world will see everything the two of you do!" AJ shouted.

# Chapter 1959 The World Is Live




When AJ had pressed the button to go live, there was a little more to it than that. As AJ had stated, he wished to write a book, one that could be passed on through the times, about the life of Quinn and those that followed him.

AJ didn't want the world, the whole universe, to go on not knowing what these people were doing for the humans, the vampires, and all of those that originated from earth. How much sacrifice and pain they had suffered, all for it to be forgotten.

The truth was AJ knew that this would be a dangerous task, ever since he had run into this group at the Chained wedding. He felt like his life was on the line then, and then there were the celestials.

Which was why he knew when he broke the promise to the others, it most likely meant that it too would be the end of his life. Videos uploaded of what had been seen so far were placed on AJ's personal channel.

Links, as to where to watch them were going on, and also a documented journal of what these people had done so far. As for the live video itself, where most of the people were watching, a brief description of who these people were and what they were doing here was scrolling on the side.

——

AJ was one of the most followed news channels, streaming channels, and video uploading sites with his own personal reporting videos. After the Chained event, his followership just went up even more.

So it was safe to say, the second he had hit that live button, that two thirds of the Earthlings had received a notification on their devices. Vampires and humans.

Due to the drastic title of the video, it was turned on in the middle of the streets, restaurants, bars and all sorts of places. Those that didn't know about the live feed received messages from their friends telling them to tune in.

It was then, that the whole world had stopped what they were doing. Stopped eating, drinking, and walking the streets to have a look at what had just happened.

"None of you know about the secret heros who have been fighting behind the scenes your entire life." AJ commented as he filmed a close up of Chris on the floor, and then soon to Peter.

At the same time, an edited clip of their battle was being shown on the same live feed in the corner of the screens.

"The people I have in front of me are the dhampir queen known as Erin and the leader of Pure, Zero. I don't have much time to explain, but I hope my uploaded videos can give you context.

"Zero, a heartless man who has killed 100,000's of people just so he can get stronger, and the dhampir who kills her own friends without a second thought, and now both of them are working together to try and summon a celestial into our world."

From the conversations that AJ had with Chris and the others, he had learnt a lot of what had actually happened. The only thing was, the people would find a lot of it hard to believe.

What AJ said was the truth, but there was no need for them to know much of the context. At this moment, the whole world thought of celestials as those trying to invade our place.

On top of that, there were many from Pure who cared for Chris and didn't understand why he had done what he had done. This gave them reason for his actions, and also someone to point the finger towards.

"Zero and that dhampir are trying to summon celestials but why, why would they do that!"

"Well, that dhampir always wanted to kill the vampires, maybe they are calling them to just get rid of the vampires?"

"But what about Chris, he worked for Pure, do you really think he would fight against his own leader if it didn't have some harm to do against humans, and we all saw those celestials. They attacked humans and vampires."

It was hard for those that were in support of the dhampirs and Pure to make an excuse for what they were hearing, and they had seen the heroic actions of both Peter and Chris before.

"As you can see, the ones that defeated the celestials before, attempted to stop both of these two, but they have failed. Which is why I am delivering this message to you all.

"These are the ones that are responsible for the chaos that have been going on in our world, and they have always been. Think about it, who were the ones causing trouble with the vampire corps, the ones messing with the Greens?

"We were always told and shown that it was a push and pull from both sides, but that has never been the case!" AJ shouted.

As a reporter, AJ was meant to always remain neutral, most of the public were fifty fifty with their views, and at some point they leaned more towards Pure.

Yet, he had thrown all that away. He could clearly see who was in the wrong. Who were the genuine ones in all of this? Peter and Chris, the two of them, never had to come to this planet.

They could have turned around at any point and time. During the fight with the celestial, they could have turned back, yet they fought until the very end.

It was too much for AJ to keep quiet about anymore. What he himself didn't realise was that AJ had a large amount of influence over the people, and they trusted him, more so than he thought.

"He's right, the vampire corps always helped us, they were even fighting against the red vampires at the time. It was just easy to say all vampires were bad."

"What does that have to do with what is going on now? I still don't understand what that has to do with bringing those celestials to our planet."

While he was making his report, Zero was checking on Chris. He was still alive, although his energy was somewhat faint. Most likely it was his werewolf body that had saved him once again.

After that, he looked up at the drone that was floating in the sky, and Zero could guess what was happening as he looked at AJ on the other side.

"I guess lasting a 1000 years is an impressive feat, not being called out for this long." Zero smiled at the camera. "But I don't care, I have only one thing on my mind."

Clenching his hand in and out, Zero noticed that he wasn't at full strength. Whether he liked it or not, he had used a substantial amount of energy in that fight.

Running at a quick pace, Zero went to his sword and stepped on the hilt flipping it in the air before catching it. Now that he had his weapon in his hand, AJ thought this was the end, they all did.

Looking to his right though, he noticed Erin had finished her fight. She was no longer on her horse, and instead of going after others as such, she was actually sitting on the floor with crossed legs.

'She must be trying to regain her Qi. It looks like her fight wasn't so easy either.' Zero thought.

Turning back, AJ jolted back a bit. With his superspeed, he was wondering how long he could last, for a second he thought he might even be able to outrun the person in front of him.

The comments were pouring in telling AJ to get out of there, but he knew it was useless. He had seen the speeds that these people could produce. The only reason why they weren't dead right now was because they could be dealt with at any moment and at any time.

Zero took in a deep breath.

'Two fights, against that celestial and then these two. I thought I was the only one that was holding back, but it looks like that wasn't the case at all.'

The mark on Zero's head lit up slightly once again, and the happy smile on Zero's face had disappeared quite quickly.

"I know, you don't need to remind me." Zero mumbled.

Walking over to Erin was Zero.

"Although that one looks dead it's hard to tell. The best thing to do would be to destroy its head."

"That's what I will be doing," Erin replied. "I can see his energy is down for the count but there is a small flicker. I need to make sure this one never gets up, so I am recovering my energy."

"There's no need." Zero pulled out the sword which started to light up pink. "I will do it myself."

Erin wasn't too far from where Peter was and she had her sword in the ground in front of her, ready to pick it up the second Peter moved, but she was confident that her ability would tell her if he did.

Now Zero stood in front of the two of them, ready to slash Peter's head off.

"Goodbye," Zero said, as he took a strike, but not toward Peter in front of him, instead, he turned around swinging it right at Erin's neck.
