# Chapter 1740: Over to the other side.

Standing right next to Laxmus were some of the most feared people presently in the world, bearing the title of Guardians. There had only been a few instances throughout history where the Guardians had appeared, and when they did, there was chaos that followed.

Their involvement completely destroyed towns, cities, and prominent establishments. It was because of this strong group of people who protected and operated the red vampires no faction could eradicate the red vampires completely.

Now they were all here in one place, the only thing that could make it worse was if the other leader of the red vampires were present as well.

"We did say we wanted to find the red vampires. I guess we won't have to do any work since they have come on their own." Lucia gulped and tightly held onto her spear.

The Guardians quickly started to move after stepping out of the shadow vortex. Their bodies shifted as if they were made of shadow themselves and went to the ground. This was a move called Shadow travel.

Now, on the floor of the arena, circular shadows could be seen moving everywhere, and they were fast, extremely fast. When the shadows reached their position, the guardian came back out of the ground and confronted the people in the arena.

Vicky, Jake, Isac, Peter, Vincent, Mitchell, Muka, Lucia, Jessica, Hannah, and Minny. Sadly, even with the others jumping in to help, they were outnumbered by the ten guardians, five strange beasts, and lastly, Laxmus himself.

Logan was watching everything while typing away as fast as he could on his keyboard.

"This... it's too much. They need to get out of there, even if I help... but why did the red vampires appear to show up?"

"Especially Laxmus, why did he decide to show himself here? There has to be a reason, and they won't leave until that reason comes into play."

Finally, all of the crowd had left the arena, and Logan knew he had no choice but to seal off the place, so no one else could enter. Then, a large dome began to appear over the arena, slowly enclosing it.

Laxmus and the others didn't seem bothered by it, and rightly so since they had the shadow powers that would allow them to come out anytime they wished, but it was also to stop others from coming in.

Logan didn't want to lose anyone, and he had a special plan for stopping the others if they were going to attempt to get out. All of the AI robots throughout Green City were gathering and standing by just outside of the dome.

"I will support you guys as much as I can from here." Logan thought. "Just try to get out of there as soon as you can."

He reported this over to his dear wife, who knew the plan but unfortunately, she herself was dealing with one of the guardians and one of the large beasts.

"I can't go easy. Otherwise, it would cost me my life, and I feel like my job, my place on this planet is still not over yet." Vicky pulled out her blade, which looked to be made of a hard dark substance, and it slowly started to turn into what looked like mud. She had activated her demon tier weapon.

Not too far from where Vicky was fighting, another member of the same family was having his own problems.

"Mom can handle herself, but Dad told me to protect the others if they got in trouble."

"So that's exactly what I'm going to do, and it's a chance to take out the big bad wolf now that he's here in front of me!"

Jake ran across the field, activating a super-speed ability, and went up to the large two-headed snake he was fighting against.

These beasts all use the shadow differently. For the snake, it looks like it's mainly concentrated in the mouth. So I just won't hit the mouth then.

A guardian looked to get in the way of Jake and the beast in front of him. He was pretty much surrounded and was one of the most guarded figures. Soon, there were two guardians and one beast just for him, but he was unfazed by this.

Jake was already running fast, and seeing the Guardian, he jumped. At the same time, the Guardian had unleashed a shadow from his back. It looked like it was starting to form into a large hand, ready to grab Jake. But before it was fully formed though, Jake spun his body and encased himself in lightning.

Like a lightning bolt, he zapped himself even faster, past the shadow hand before it could touch him.

"Training those lighting powers with Zinon really came in handy. I must believe in myself that I'm the strongest human! With my father's intelligence and the strongest power of my mother, I can beat anyone who gets in my way!"

Slamming into one of the serpent's heads, Jake had almost knocked it off its feet, but it had a hefty base. Either way, Jake wasn't planning to defeat the beast with that attack alone. When the lightning died down, the beast's body appeared in everyone's vision, and they could see he was bleeding black blood heavily.

By then, Jake had transformed one of his hands into metallic spikes at the last second and using the power of his speed ability and the lightning, he had managed to pierce the rugged hide of the beast.

"It's time to turn up the heat here as I melt you from inside out!" Jake shouted.

Part of his hand had transformed and was stuck in the beast. Now, he was raising the temperature of his body and activating his hightning powers from within.

The serpent's other head hissed and came towards him, and it looked like it was trying to get Jake off its body. It opened its mouth wide, revealing a set of fangs and the endless shadows inside, but it suddenly stopped before reaching Jake.

After a moment, black blood poured out of its mouth while making a sizzling noise as it evaporated into a cloud of black mist. It didn't take long for both heads to fall to the ground, and its body slumped down. Then, pulling his hand out of the beast's body, Jake transformed it back to normal.

"That's one of those beasts down. Now it's time I deal with the rest of you. I'll happily take you out one at a time if I have to." Jake smiled.

Still, he knew that the Guardians would be harder to deal with than the shadow beasts.

On the other side of the arena, Peter, who was originally next to Vincent, was now being blocked by a Guardian and shadow beasts.

The bear beast Peter was fighting against before seemed to be going up against Vincent, who was also fighting a guardian.

While Guardians also surrounded his friends who had jumped into the arena, however, they had to fight them off on their own because Peter couldn't help them right now.

A guardian stood behind Peter, and a strange black beast stood before him. It looked like a giant turtle but had a head of a dragon and also had several spikes on its hard shell.

"Get out of the way! I want to fight that damned Laxmus!" Peter charged in, and strange shadows not far from the turtle appeared in front of its two hands, and a large one appeared behind its back.

Long sharp hard-spike-sized bristles began to come out from its back, and then, the beast sent them into the shadow behind its back. In the next instant, they suddenly appeared out of the shadow vortex in front of its hands. They were incoming faster than a bullet from a gun, heading straight towards Peter.

"This is all starting to piss me off!" Peter yelled as his head-tail moved faster, striking all the bristles and cutting them in half. It allowed Peter to run forward without decreasing his pace as he was sure he wouldn't get hurt.

And when he was close enough, Peter jumped, and he reached the same height as the giant beast. At that moment, he allowed two of the bristles to pass through the tail defence dome he had created and caught them in both of his hands.

"I warned you, you damned hedgehog dragon!" Peter shouted.

His head-tail sliced the two arms off the giant beast as if they were made of butter. They fell to the floor, and now with nothing to stop him, Peter slammed both the bristles in his hands straight into the beast's head.

With his strength and the sharpness of the bristles, they went in with ease, killing another one of the strong shadow beasts. When the shadow beast's body slammed into the ground, Peter landed on top of it.

But to his surprise, the person on the other side wasn't Laxmus but the Guardian who had been standing behind him.

Peter clenched his fists and was about to make a move when he suddenly hesitated for a moment and frowned at the Guardian in front of him.

Raising his hand, Peter then pointed his finger at the Guardian and said in a surprised tone. "Wait... I recognize you!"

***

# Chapter 1741: Betrayed.

There was a pause from Peter as he looked at the Guardian in front of him. A lot of the built-up energy he had disappeared, and the skin on his body was still somewhat hurting. However, it wasn't to the point where it had an adverse effect on him, and because the rage overran his thoughts, he hadn't even thought about what would have happened if he was hit again by the strange shadow.

"I know you, don't I?" Peter asked, and quickly he started to cancel his transformation, so more of his usual appearance started to show.

It was easy for Peter now to turn his celestial form on and off, so he didn't think it would be a problem, but knowing this person and not being able to put his finger on who it was, was seriously bugging him.

"It's you!" The Guardian finally responded, "I... didn't think you would still be alive, and unlike you, my appearance has changed greatly from before."

"But, you're right, we once did know each other. I am Ashley."

At first, the name didn't click in Peter's head, but soon he started to remember. Ashley was Paul's right-hand man. He was the leader of the vampire soldiers, who had eventually turned into the vampire Corps Unit.

Ashley in front of Peter looked older and more rugged but still had a strong, powerful body and an air of confidence around him. Only his eyes seemed much dull compared to before.

"Yes, I remember now...Quinn saved you guys." Peter slowly spoke, "He saved you when the vampires were going to kill you."

"You know, that bastard of a boss of yours tried killing Quinn? So what the hell are you doing on the other side?"

Peter started to gather his celestial energy again, changing his form again, ready for a fight. The others seemed to be fairing alright against the Guardians and beasts, but honestly, Peter didn't know if they could win this. In his head, the way for them to win this battle was to take out Laxmus.

Peter began to charge forward, but when he did, his foot touched the ground, and he tried to push off, but it felt slightly lighter. That's when he noticed it was touching the shadow, slowing down his movements.

Looking back up, Peter saw a blood slash heading his way. He covered his head by crossing his arms. The attack had hit, and it was quite powerful, pushing Peter somewhat, but it did not harm him.

"If all the guardians are as weak as you, we have nothing to worry about!" Peter roared.

Peter tried to move his tail head, but it was already encased by even more shadow which wrapped around his tail head like it was an arm holding onto it.

"This shadow is strange. I can feel him holding on to it, and I can't move my tail head!" Peter thought.

The shadow seemed to contain some traits similar to Quinn's, while at the same time, there were apparent differences. It was the same as when Peter had punched the shadow Laxmus had created.

And the form of the shadow felt more solid than Quinn's, and there was a limit to Quinn's. Because for him, each hit would consume a large amount of MC cells.

Peter somewhat understood when Laxmus had blocked his attack, but now one of the guardians was also able to jam his head-tail.

Ashley was already on top of him, throwing out his fist towards Peter. A red aura covered his arm, making it look like a blade. Moving his hand, Peter grabbed the fist, holding it in place. The red aura had pierced through his hand, and it was bleeding, but Peter didn't care.

"I think you guys have gotten a bit too confident thinking that there is no one out there who can beat you. I need to show you your place!" Peter shouted, throwing out his fist. Then, taking the shadow off the head-tail, Ashley tried to move it to block the attack.

The shadow could move at a fast speed, faster than when Quinn used it, but it wasn't fast enough as Peter's fist pounded Ashley's chest, causing a crack on the best armour he was wearing and sending him flying back through the air.

While in midair, Ashley used the shadow to create small wings while also infusing his blood aura. The shadow blood wings looked somewhat horrifying! and it didn't help when Ashley flapped them to slow himself down and went on one knee, holding his chest.

Curling his lip air, he hissed at Peter baring his fangs. "You don't understand anything!" Ashley shouted with a bit of blood dripping from his mouth.

"You think I'm on the wrong side? I just realised what the right side was. You are the one in the wrong!" Ashley shouted, standing up. "If Paul were alive, he would understand our choice! You are trying to save the humans, why?!"

"Are you forgetting something, you idiot?" Peter raised his eyebrows, "You were a human as well. Maybe because you have been a vampire for so long, you have forgotten that."

"No, I haven't, and they are not like me," Ashley replied. "They... they kill their own, they killed my family. My family members were humans as well, but just because I was a vampire, they murdered them. Do you understand? Do you understand the pain I went through!?"

"And as for Quinn. He promised us that he would find a way to turn us back into a human, but he never did, and I'm not the only one that has experienced things like this happen to them!"

"This is why if Quinn can't turn us back, there is another solution to solve the problem. Turn everyone into a vampire. Let them suffer through what we have experienced!"

They were strong emotions coming from Ashley, and Peter could somewhat understand it, but none of this was their fault. A few immoral people were running it for everyone, and while they were away, they had managed to go down the wrong end.

Gathering all the strength in his leg, Peter ran forward and then pushed off using his head-tail from the ground, kicking it up and giving him extra strength to move forward. It was so fast Ashley had no time to react at all, and his chest was still hurting from the pain before.

Before he knew it. Peter had grabbed his mouth. And then lifted his whole body into the air.

"Because you once knew Quinn and helped him out, I will spare you. So get out of my way!" Peter threw Ashley away like a rag doll, crashing it into the floor. This created a large crater underneath, and the attack was so strong it caused the others to look over at what was happening.

Letting go, it looked like Ashley was almost dead because he wasn't moving, but Peter didn't care. Instead, he turned his gaze towards Laxmus.

"You're next."

*** *** ***

Meanwhile, Vincent wasn't going on the offensive against the bear or the Guardian. His speed was fast, but not on the level of Jake Green or Peter. Instead, he had stronger blood powers he could use to finish them in a single blow.

However, he was worried that if he went after one of them, the other would be able to attack him, and without knowing the full strength of these guardians, this was a risky plan. Finally though, the guardian fighting against Vincent, who had a mask covering his face, charged in.

So far, he had just been making blood attacks, which confused Vincent because they weren't as strong as he had expected. In fact, they were a little too weak.

Now as the Guardian came with his fists, Vincent was on guard, assuming the enemy's hand-to-hand combat skills would be better, but something unexpected happened.

"Just pretend to fight." A voice suddenly entered his ears. It was the Guardian who he was fighting against.

Blocking the first punch, Vincent could tell that the Guardian had receded all the energy at the last moment, significantly lowering the attack power.

"I'm on your side. I promise you that, Vincent. This is why I need you to listen to me."

"If you want the others to live, it would be best to leave with me and let Laxmus take you. Otherwise, everyone will die."

***

# Chapter 1742: A missing piece.

Should he trust the vampire or not? So was the question going through Vincent's mind when he heard the Guardian's words. He knew the vampire in front of him wasn't attacking at full strength while still making their fight look somewhat flashy.

So it was clear he didn't want to fight, but the thing was, they still wanted Vincent to come along with them. What was the guarantee that this was not an elaborate trap for him to surrender in order to save the others?

"Let's see how he deals with this! As he increased the blood aura in his strike," Vincent thought and sent out a powerful strike. Seeing this, the Guardian jumped back, covered his fist in a red aura, and punched the incoming attack, shattering it to pieces.

"That answered one question. At least I know he does have the strength to do something." Vincent thought.

It was then that Vincent charged in and went back to hand-to-hand combat because there were multiple vampires around them. If they shouted, there was a good chance the others could hear. A clash of fake fist punches hit each other, and now the two were blocking and attacking simultaneously.

"Who are you? Why would I even trust what you say? If you want me to at least listen to you, then tell me who you are?" Vincent asked and suddenly increased his strength a little, giving a hard kick on the Guardian's guts.

"Damn you." The Guardian replied.

"Can't you see, Laxmus is just playing with you all? He hasn't even used the extent of his shadow powers, and neither has he joined the fight. And trust me, he can do things that none of you can even imagine."

Looking at the field, Vincent saw how the others were fairing, and it looked like they were struggling against the Guardians alone.

Still, at the same time, Vincent had a feeling that those that had gathered around Quinn wouldn't lose out so quickly either.

It was then that he saw Jake Green, along with Peter, kill two of the shadow beasts that Laxmus summoned.

"They aren't as weak as you think, and if they are really friends of him, then Laxmus is a fool if he thinks he can just do what he wants and get away." Vincent replied.

"Laxmus is after you, Vincent. He only wants you! So you can save everyone!" The person charged in, punching harder and faster as he got frustrated. "And also don't want anyone to get hurt!"

Vincent parried away the hit and, at that moment, saw the look in the Guardian's eyes. They were fierce, and Vincent believed he had seen them before, but they were incredibly hard to recall as they couldn't have been someone he had seen often.

"I work with Layla." The man finally replied.

"And I promise that the two of us will do anything in our power to make sure you are safe. So if you don't believe me, then at least believe in her!"

*** *** ***

With Peter being the only one taking out the Guardian and beast in front of him, the other guardians weren't so quick to stop him, and Laxmus welcomed the person in front of him.

"I can tell you have the power of a god inside you," Laxmus said as he walked forward, the shadow covering his body, mainly his back. Over his shoulders, it looked almost like there were two large spikes formed from shadows and had the image of horrifying faces inside as well.

"The others are no match for you." Laxmus continued. "Unfortunately, my God is a strong one and has been quite generous to me, so you are no match for me either."

The two of them were about ten metres apart, but even then, Laxmus threw out his hand as if he was reaching out to grab Peter. At that moment, the shadow left his hand in the form of a huge claw.

And when Laxmus closed his hand, it closed on Peter and grabbed him. The next second, Laxmus lifted him into the air.

"My shadow is faster and stronger than before, and no amount of Qi, celestial energy, or vampire energy can break it!" Laxmus replied in a smug tone.

These words seemed quite true as Peter swung his head-tail into the shadow. But, when it came in contact with the shadow, it slowed down again. It was the same for Peter's body himself. He struggled and tried to move and break free, but it seemed that he was unable to do anything even with all of the new celestial points he gained.

"It looks like you are the strongest that your little group has to offer. I haven't even used my energy to transform my body, and I can defeat you simply like this."

"I guess your god must not care about you so much." Lexmus smirked.

Then, lifting Peter with the shadow hand, he slammed the former to the ground at a frightening speed and force. It sank the whole arena a little bit, sending shockwaves through the pillars attached to the arena connected to the sea underneath.

Everyone paused as the arena shook for a few seconds as they felt the power in the slam of the shadow arm. And as Laxmus lifted Peter off the ground once again, Peter coughed out a load of blood, but he was still alive, his body transformed.

"You... would never be able to amount to him," Peter gritted his teeth. The rage inside him had reached a tipping point.

Laxmus narrowed his eyes and then used the shadow hand to pull Peter towards him while clenching the fist, ready to punch the life out of the latter. And at the same time, power was rising through his hand, and it started to grow slightly in size, the outer skin began to change to a solid black and strange white lines were running up and down where the veins would be.

His fingers elongated, and the tip of them turned solid white. It was clear that Laxmus was using his celestial energy now to change his body parts, but it looked different from before. Now, he had changed, and he had gotten stronger.

"Laxmus, he had a 1000 years to gather his strength, he truly is dangerous... and Peter is far beyond the power I can rise within me unless I have to resort to some serious methods, should I trust this person?"

"Maybe it's the only choice I have." Vincent started to think as he reconsidered the Guardian's offer.

Being dragged through the air, Peter thought of the words Laxmus had said.

"I need to protect Quinn... it's my job to protect and help him. I owe him everything, even my whole life, and I can't even take out one person for him?"

Desperate, Peter started to focus his celestial energy on his two fists. His hands had never let him down. He didn't know if it would do anything because activating the celestial energy was usually something that would just change his whole body Still, of course, he was in a desperate situation and would use any means within his limits.

Just like he would normally focus his Qi, he was doing the same, putting all the energy into his fists. The black outer casing with the red lines running up to Peter's fingertips had a red brilliance as they got brighter.

At the same time, the rest of Peter's body was starting to change, his head-tail was disappearing, and his old appearance was coming back. Looking at his fists, they were now twice the size they were before.

"Get your f*cking hand off of me!" Peter shouted as he slammed both his fists down on the wrist of the shadow, trying to force Laxmus to let go. A large explosion pierced the sky, shaking the clouds and the air above the arena.

A shockwave that appeared out of nowhere shocked the others, pushing them a few inches back, and for the first time, Laxmus's smug expression had faltered, and the smile on his face had receded.

That was because Peter had destroyed half of the shadow hand with just one punch.

It was the first experience for Laxmus, but the shadow was slowly coming back and was still holding onto Peter. So he wasn't able to completely destroy it as he wished.

"You just need a little help!" A voice suddenly called out from above Peter's head.

And when he looked up, Peter thought he imagined things for a second as he could see Quinn, but that was because he quickly remembered that there was another on the battlefield that looked like him.

Swinging his arms down, Vincent looked like he was punching the air, but he was actually moving a piece of string, and attached to its other end was a sword. And as this extraordinary sword struck down and touched the shadow hand, large explosions went off one after another.

It had hit Peter, but he had moved away, and that's when he noticed he was free. Now in front of him, there was Vincent.

"You saved me and I returned the favour" Vincent said as he pulled the string, retracting the sword back into his hand.

As soon as Peter saw the sword, only one thought flashed in his mind

"This is Arthur's sword!"

***

# Chapter 1743: No More Luck.

After the group saw Muka regaining her composure and jumping down to the arena floor where the fighting was going, the rest followed her. They didn't know why, but with Quinn gone, there was always someone who would naturally next take charge, and all of them seemed to follow her.

Even if she was flustered at this moment, there would usually be a sense of air around her. A leader wasn't just who was strongest. Peter could have taken that role, but he wasn't one to order others or help them out, yet Muka felt more like one.

Maybe it was the fact that Muka was already a leader before. The group had done little to help so far though, when the shadow beast had come, the group was waiting for some order from her, but she said only a few words.

"They are dangerous, and now is not the time. It is best if we wait." Although she said this, Muka still felt slightly nervous, and Mithcell, who was standing closest to her, could hear her say a couple more words quietly under her breath. "I think..."

Hearing this, Mitchell wondered if they were doing the right thing. He had heard about her ability, but no one truly knew how it worked. If she weren't in the right mindset, perhaps it would affect her ability as well.

Either way, it was too late to act, as the Guardians had arrived, and four of them had surrounded them -each of them with the power of the shadow seen hovering behind their backs.

The first thing the group did was try and get out of their situation. They threw out blood swipes from all directions. Lightning strikes also came from Lucia on top of that. However, the group of guardians was able to do something they didn't expect.

Seeing the attack, they moved their shadow and placed it in front of them. It was then that each of their shadows had linked up and grew larger, nearly creating a dome over the group. When their attacks hit the shadow, they had done next to nothing.

Slowly, the shadow dome was growing larger, and soon it looked like it would trap all of them. The group just continued to attack, but all attempts were turning futile.

"Use your heads, don't just try the same thing over and over again!" Mitchell shouted.

His body started to change and transform as the casing on his eye increased, and it began to glow red. Soon his hand grew in size and narrowed out, turning into a rifle, giving him a chance to fire a powerful blood rifle.

He aimed at the top and fired into the air. The shadow looked like it was just about to close, but when the strong blood aura hit, mixed with the celestial energy, it pushed the shadow away slightly.

Shaking her head, Muka realized how stupid she had been.

"Let's get out of here."

She easily picked up a couple of the others around her and started to jump in the air. Unfortunately, the dome created was quite the large one, so she could not clear the dome in a single jump. Furthermore, she neither had the power of flight, so it looked like she would soon just fall back down.

That's when a solid form of blood aura appeared under her feet and made it easier and quicker for her to jump. Once again, before the shadow dome was about to close up, Mitchell shot another blood aura from the rifle, breaking the shadow.

"Don't worry about us," Mithcell said as he was on the ground with Lucia and Hannah. The two Muka had taken, Jessica and Minny, were the closest at the time. "Make your ability work and get us out of here so we can help you."

Muka, with the other two, had successfully gone out of the shadow dome created, while the others were now stuck in complete darkness. Again, in an attempt to break out, Mitchell fired out his blood rifle towards the side this time.

It had hit the shadow and cleared some of them away, causing them to move, and show gaps on the outside but quickly reformed over, trapping them within the dome.

"Even the new celestial energy won't work. This shadow power is incredibly strong. We might not survive this one," Hannah said, staring at the space around her.

Lucia had grabbed onto the blood amulet that Quinn had given to her after using the new ability upon leveling up as a celestial. The amulet had continued to gather energy ever since the event commenced and was gathering even more so now.

"I still think we have a chance," Lucia said, clenching the amulet.

*** *** ***

Landing outside of the dome, the first thing Muka saw was the four guardians using both their hands to supply their shadow powers into the dome. Seeing this was the case, she thought it was her chance.

Charging in, she pulled a weapon out from her rope, it was as large as a short sword, but the top was spiked and thick. It was a mace.

In truth, Muka was one of the few vampires and vampire leaders that actually fought with a weapon. As she used her red aura and control, blood began to move up the mace and enveloped the spikes, making the weapon even more powerful.

Then, she threw out her weapon toward one of the Guardians, aiming it right for their head. It was the perfect shot until the Guardian turned around and lifted his hand. Then, taking some of the shadows from the dome and stopping the mace in the air.

"That doesn't matter!" Muka thought as she went in now with her nails covered in small parts of aura and thrust it forward, aiming right for the man's chest.

The guardian didn't move, but when Muka's hand had hit the other's chest, instead of feeling flesh or blood falling, there was nothing but a shadow that moved.

"Is his whole body made of shadows? What is going on here?"

Muka froze in shock, and before she could react, she suddenly saw a fist coming toward her and hitting her right in the face, sending her back to where she was. Standing behind her, Jessica and Minny had managed to stop Muka from falling over.

"These guys have all sorts of tricks, I see," Jessica said, wondering if she should use her dhampir power.

Whether or not it would make a difference was another thing, but with so many vampires around her, she would certainly get a boost in abilities compared to usual.

"That punch, it was a strong one as well." Muka wiped the blood away from her mouth.

"Their blood aura, strength, and speed are as good as a vampire leader, and my ability isn't working in this situation."

"With their shadow stronger than Arthur's and Quinn's, I don't know what to do." Muka admitted.

These words didn't really give confidence to others until the little girl was also shaking, but unlike others, she was shaking with anger.

"You want to be Daddy's wife, right?!" Minny gritted her teeth as Muka.

"Then you need to show all your strength, and you need to be stronger than that. Or else how can you be worthy?"

Minny then turned to the other guardians, who still hadn't moved from their position.

"You idiots, how dare you hurt my dad's future wife!" Minny yelled at them and erupted with energy. This time, it wasn't vampire energy. Instead, it was celestial energy.

And as she erupted, a red flame covered her entire body, as large as a standard person. It was then that Minny's body started to transform, and the first thing that was visibly noticeable about her was something growing out from the top of her head, through her hair.

Pushing through her curly hair, there were two pointy things, orange in colour, with a shade of dark red, that had started to appear, and right at the tip, they curled upwards.

It was clear they were a set of horns, and with her red eyes, Minny almost looked like a demon from hell.

***

# Chapter 1744: The Markings glow.

Minny had activated her celestial energy, and she wasn't shy about the anger that had risen in her. But, in truth, when Quinn had given her the celestial energy, he had told her it would be best if she did not use it to avoid attracting unnecessary attention.

However, there was one condition to this, and that was if Quinn, for some reason, wasn't around to protect her, she shouldn't hesitate. In this case, Minny knew the others were in trouble, especially since Muka was also injured. She decided to use the energy, irrespective of the consequences. Two large horns had appeared on her head, but that wasn't the only change on her.

Minny's eyes not only grew red, but there seemed to be red tears streaming down her cheek. Some would think it was blood if it wasn't for its emitting glow. It ran down her face, stopping just shy of rolling off her cheeks.

At the same time, her arms were also transforming. A rigid outer scale clad her legs and arm, going up to the elbow and knees. It looked like melted lava was forming around her body. Eventually, when it stopped, Minny had dark scaled hands that were twice the size they had before, and it was the same with her legs.

Her main body looked the same size, but it was still a frightening figure for the others to look at.

"AHHHH!" Minny screamed and was already on the move, but she was too fast to catch even for Jessica, who was also outside of the shadow dome. All she could see was a red mist where Minny once was.

Muka could just keep an eye on her and saw Minny was in the air, already towards one of the guardians. She looked like a wild beast in the air, and she had locked her eyes on her opponent. Her arm swung out above her head slightly to the side.

While in the palm of her hand was a ball of red aura. The Guardian was able to confront this in the last few seconds, and the shadow from the dome had risen in time, But Minny shoved the blood aura ball right into the shadow,

A large explosion of energy had collided with the shadows, causing it to disperse. The attack had hit and destroyed the shadow but could not carry on and hurt the Guardian, but that didn't matter.

When the Guardian looked in front of him, Minny was nowhere to be seen. That was because she had already landed on the ground and pushed off, using her other hand, swinging another ball of red energy right towards his back.

As she pushed the ball of raw energy into the Guardian's back, he was sent flying in the air, and a particular part of the dome's shadow was now dispersing.

"I thought that little brat was a nobody!" Another Guardian shouted.

Seeing how fast the small vampire was and how strong she was, they wondered if they should give up on the shadow dome and perhaps focus their attention elsewhere.

That was, however, when a particular person appeared behind them.

"I was being a bit foolish!" A female voice spoke.

Turning around, the Guardian saw a beauty right in front of him. Never in his life could he even imagine a person of this calibre, and yet here she was in front of him. Even when looking at her, it appeared like there was a majestic red glow around her.

Because of the celestial energy, Muka's hair had grown in size, going down to her waist, but that wasn't the only thing. Her hair colour was now a dark red and was floating in the air. It appeared as if each strand of her hair was being controlled.

When one looked closer, it almost looked as if there were little snakes at its end. These little snakes all opened their mouths, hissing towards the guardians, summoning up their energy.

The Guardian would have had to use his shadow if he had any chance of blocking this attack, and maybe even then, it would have stood no chance, but something was stopping him from doing so.

When looking straight into Muka's eyes, it felt like his whole body was frozen, and never in his wildest dreams could bear to hurt such a beauty.

"Will you marry m..." The Guardian tried to say, but Muka blasted him with her hair strands before he could finish his words.

Multiple red lasers had torn through his body, head, and heart. It looked like a machine gun had shot him, and eventually, the Guardian fell to the floor.

With only two of the remaining Guardians keeping up the shadow dome, it had weakened and felt like it would be useless for them to do such a thing, but before they even let go, they felt a burst of energy from the inside.

The shadow was breaking bit by bit, and something was hitting every part of the dome from the inside. There wasn't enough time for the shadow to repair itself as it had done before. As more and more of the shadow started to disappear, the others could see clearly what was happening.

Sparks of red lighting were firing off in all sorts of different directions. It was constantly hitting the shadow, and eventually, it had disappeared entirely.

Then, standing in the centre of where the shadow dome once was, they saw Lucia, her amulet around her neck lighting up and the spear in her hand, with the tip emitting a small amount of lightning.

"This amulet... gave me so much power... it fused with my lightning skills perfectly, and it also isn't using as many MC cells as expected." Lucia was amazed by the power of the Celestial marked amulet.

"I haven't even used the other skill that the amulet holds."

It was then, for the first time in a while, that Lucia had a smile on her face. She felt empowered, and most of all, she felt like she could help her new friends.

Soon after, Minny jumped towards the others and crashed right into Lucia, knocking her onto the ground. She was still transformed, but her expression was that of a lost baby.

"I'm so happy that everyone... everyone is okay." Minny sniffled.

Not far behind were Jessica and Muka, who had landed in the centre and the group was once again reunited. Although it was how they got trapped the first time, now with their full strength realised and activated, they no longer feared the shadow that contained them.

The guardians gathered around their dead one, including the one Minny had injured.

"Many of them seem to carry a power similar to ours. He instructed us not to use it unless necessary." One of the guardians stated.

"I think, now that one of us has died, this has become a critical situation. However, I am sure Laxmus will not hurt us because of this." The other replied.

The three of them moved back away from the group, just far enough so they wouldn't be interrupted by what they were about to do next. Then, less than a second later, parts of their body started to glow. And as it happened, the others could see a marking on them.

"They're... they're the same." Muka pointed out.

"They are just like us. Someone gave them similar power as what Quinn gave us."

The group was already having trouble with the guardians before they used their celestial energy and transformed, and just when they were getting an edge, it seemed like the others were able to one up them.

"We have a chance!" Lucia stated. "We outnumbered them, and Quinn gave us the things we needed. He has given us enough power to get rid of these guys!"

Hearing Lucia, the only human in the group, shout these words encouraged them, and some in the group had yet to show everything they had. Just as they took their fighting stance, a dark shadow began filling the entire floor.

This pitch-black shadow continued to spread through the arena and soon reached the very edge of the arena. It then started to rise, creating a dome over them.

Upon turning their heads, they could see this was all the work of a single person, Laxmus.

***

# Chapter 1745: Afraid.

Laxmus had yet to use his power in battle, and Peter knew this. Nevertheless, he hadn't moved from his position, and there was a confident smug look on his face even after Peter had defeated one of the guardians and the shadow beast.

In all honesty, Laxmus had only shown the power of his shadow, and it was enough to make them struggle, which was why Peter couldn't imagine the strength in his transformed arm if he was to be hit by it. Thankfully though, Vincent was there, and Peter noticed the special sword in his hand.

Watching the fight go on, Logan was tense up till this moment, almost biting off his fingernails.

"Arthur's sword... It was with Vincent? I always assumed it could have disintegrated into the red heart, but if Vincent has it, it's getting more and more that he has the Red Heart."

It was then that a thought had clicked in his head.

"Wait, why is Laxmus here in the first place? What have the red vampires been after all this time, the Red Heart? Then that means they were after Vincent. but how would they know that he was here."

A particular face of a celestial appeared in his head, the same celestial whom they had run in at the top of the Green City before the event began.

"Bliss, that damned god can see the future. She made Quinn go away on purpose. She must have told Laxmus all of this. It's clear, we definitely can't trust her anymore."

The question was, without Quinn would they be able to stop Laxmus? Logan knew that perhaps there would be some of them on their side who thought that Quinn would return in time to prevent the situation from taking any worse turn, just like he had done the times before.

However, living a thousand years without Quinn's presence, Logan knew they had to act themselves. Otherwise, something terrible would occur.

"Someone used that sword on me once before; I remember it quite well," Laxmus remarked as his arm transformed to what it once was, but the shadow continued over his back, mainly over his shoulders, forming the two shadow spikes.

"Back then, they couldn't defeat me, and I didn't even have my shadow power. Since then, a long time has passed, and I am now stronger than before."

"This sword of yours won't change today's outcome." Laxmus said, looking at the person in front of him.

He was talking to Peter but rather continued to stare at Vincent.

"Your words," Vincent replied. "It sounds like you are trying to make me give up."

This was what Vincent had to assume after hearing what one of the Guardians had said.

"I remember the event you are talking about, and it really has been a long time, and I can't help but wonder why even after a 1000 years do you still remember something so insignificant?"

"You keep staring at me. Is it this face? Was it because this person was nearly the cause of your death."

Lifting the sword, Vincent held it with a single hand by the hilt. It looked too large for someone to do such a thing, but of course, with a vampire's strength, it was possible.

"I want to tell you something, I'm not him, but you should fear me as much as you do him."

Vincent threw his hand forward, pushing it out by the rounded bottom, and just as it left his hand, a strong force of blood could be seen pushing out the sword.

The whole sword began to light up, and went through the air like a rocket. The trail of strong blood followed it, and it was Vincent's aura that was being used. Behind the sword, the red aura was so large that it looked like a giant blood tidal wave was coming out of the sword's hilt.

Seeing this, the smug smile on Laxmus's face slowly disappeared. And, powerful energy started to gather inside him. This time, both of his arms had transformed black and had grown twice their size. Again, it would have looked strange, but Laxmus already had a large body.

White streaks were running through his black hands and were pulsating. Unlike before though, this pulsing feeling could be felt and seen through the air. Laxmus was just standing there, and each pulse from his arms made ripples in the air.

The next second, he moved from where he was and began to run forward, heading straight towards the sword. On his way there though, he wasn't stopped directly.

But from the sky itself, several large metal balls were raining down. Large shadows were cast and crashed into the ground. Laxmus had avoided them, but they weren't few.

They looked like small asteroids were falling into the arena ground as the whole place shook. As for the one who was behind this attack, he could be seen standing on a pillar up in the air, aiming the attack right down at Laxmus, he was none other than Jake Green.

"Dad told me to do whatever I can to stop Laxmus, and that's what I'll do. I don't have to fight those other guys. I just needed to get them out of the battle!" Jake thought.

During his fight, Jake had an idea from what he had seen on the battlefield elsewhere. That was to trap the Guardians in a solid hardened metallic ball and then send them underground.

He followed the place, but it wasn't a permanent solution to the problem because he knew they would eventually get out, and there was also no way for him to attack them while they were in the solid ball of metal. Nevertheless, he had made it so thick and heavy that it would be troublesome to get out. even for someone with similar strength.

However, there was also their shadow. With their shadow, the Guardians could phase through materialistic things, which was why Logan, using the power of his third ability, was able to do something: he injected a portion of his electrical power into the metal ball before it formed. As a result, he constantly created lightning currents, and they would rebound inside the metal ball.

After all, the lighting inside the ball wasn't meant to defeat them. He wouldn't be able to continuously supply it with his MC cells, but it was just to somewhat paralyse their body to make it so they could not use their shadow power.

During this time, Jake was ready to do battle with Laxmus and was heading his way until he got a message from his father.

"Although I said to do everything you can to stop them from getting Vincent, that doesn't mean you have to put your own life on the line. You understand that, right?"

Hearing his father say these words for the first time. to him, the one that the world dubbed the made him a little nervous. For one, the Blade family relied on using other abilities for their powers.

It was their weakness, which was why the strength of the blade varied depending on those around them. There was only one that had overcome that weakness, and there had never been a Blade like that person since then.

Still, Jake thought he could make a difference with his soul weapon, and he needed to use his head more in battle, combining his multiple powers to create the most decisive attack.

It looked like Jake could not hit Laxmus a single time despite all of this. In his frustration, he raised both hands above his head and created a huge solid object.

At first, he used the Earth ability to mould the large piece of land, and then he hardened it with his Hardening ability, and lastly, he used his Lightning powers to give it an electrifying edge.

Hurling it with his strength and pushing it with his telekinesis, it looked like the moon itself was being hurled straight towards Laxmus, but for Laxmus, there was still the sword to deal with.

Now upon him, he had dodged the sword by bending his back, not using any of his shadow powers, and then grabbed onto the weapon's hilt with both hands. However, the enormous blood energy made it hard for him to use his hands, and the sword's momentum pulled him back in the direction he came from.

Powering more energy into the sword and the large planet-like structure moving towards Laxmus, it looked like any second it would hit him as the shadow had covered his entire body.

Suddenly, Laxmus opened his mouth wide, and a large red beam came out of his mouth and hit the large object created by Jake green. This attack of his held the solid object in place, and at that moment, he closed his mouth and spun his body with the sword in his hand, swinging it at the large object.

It cut right through the solid object and let off a series of explosions as the red aura spread throughout the arena.

It looked like Laxmus had used his own energy, as well as diverted Vincent's energy on it, and now, the large object was seen crumbling to pieces and falling to the ground. As for the sword, it was now in Laxmus's hands.

"The sword is in my hand now, and you three have annoyed me," Laxmus took a deep breath as the shadow left his body and instantly shrouded the whole arena.

***

# Chapter 1746: Unbeatable.

The shadow had quickly spread across the whole arena floor, which wasn't a small area by any means. It had disrupted what the others were doing, and even the guardians slowed down with their own attacks.

Eventually, all of the guardians, including those who were injured, were picked up by their fellow teammates and were soon standing behind Laxmus. With their speed, it didn't take long for them to regroup, and at the same time, the others who were in the shadow realised something.

"This shadow slows our movements down... this is worse than that dome the Guardians trapped us in earlier." Lucia thought.

This thought was going through everyone trapped in the shadow, and they knew it was useless to chase after the enemies they were fighting against a few moments ago.

Instead, some had tried to attack the shadow under them, Lucia even stabbed her spear, summoning her new lightning powers. The shadow stirred, but unlike the shadow dome, it didn't disappear.

For a second, it caused Lucia's heart to thump louder. "This is getting really dangerous... just how strong is the Red Vampire leader?"

On the 'Graylash' side, there wasn't much information about the Red Vampires. However, the Green group and Pure would often talk about getting rid of the Red Vampires with ease, as long as they knew where they were.

Lucia believed these things as well, but after witnessing Laxmus's strength, it didn't seem to be the case at all. Perhaps, they were just declaring these things to make the people not worry.

"This power is a waste on you all," Laxmus said, lifting up the sword and giving it a swing as if he was testing it out.

It cut through the air cleanly, and the single swing caused a shockwave to appear through the air, hitting the edge of the arena. An explosion shook the arena in the next moment, and a large crack reaching up to the upper deck of seats appeared from that edge of the arena.

"This sword seems to be wasted on all of you. All of these weapons, all of these different powers, yet none of you can even step in front of me."

Hearing this, Minny, who was still in her transformed state, was the first one to move. She ran forward, and although a little slower now because of the shadow, her movement was still incredibly fast.

At the same time, not far behind her, Muka had run after her, using her blood aura to create hardened platforms, allowing her to look like she was running through the air, not far behind Minny. The others were too slow to act.

Laxmus, seeing this, just laughed and moved his foot slightly. Shooting up from the shadow was a large hand, catching Minny mid-air. The shadow fingers tightened their grip over her body and restrained her.

She struggled, trying to move her arms and legs, and just like Peter before, she was unable to break out with her strength. Muka, who wasn't too far behind, had brandished her mace. She was ready to hit the shadow away, charging up her attack, but another hand appeared out of the shadowed floor in front of her, bigger than her own body and the one that had grabbed Minny.

It did the same to Muka. But, Muka could use her snake-like hair even if her limbs were tied. The snake heads looked downwards, and then, opening their mouth wide, they attacked the shadow with the red aura ray.

It was a powerful attack, but when Muka had stopped, it failed to damage the shadow. Just like the outcome of Lucia's attack, the shadow moved a little but was unaffected by her attack.

"This is bad. Dad, what do we do?" Jake frowned.

Unfortunately though, Logan didn't have an answer as he found himself speechless. Everything they knew about the shadow, from Quinn and Arthur, all of the information they had, seemed like it was useless now.

It was clear from the beginning that Laxmus's shadow was different from Quinn's. Logan knew it was, but he just didn't know to what extent. And he was hoping it wouldn't be this powerful, but it was, and he had a strong intuition that this was not the limit.

More big shadow hands with pointed dangly fingers began to sprout from the ground. They had grabbed everyone one by one and held them tight, just like with Minny and Muka, and no matter how much the others struggled, they couldn't break free from the powerful, shadow hands.

The last person to face the shadow was Peter. He stared at the ground in front of him and saw the ripples appearing on the shadowed ground beneath him. Then, he did the same as he had done before - concentrating his energy directly on his fists.

The moment Peter saw the hand start to appear, he punched his fist down into the ground as hard as possible. A large wave of energy blasted the shadow hand, and the force instantly obliterated it. He looked around and noticed that he wasn't one of the only ones who wasn't trapped by the strange shadow power.

There was someone else who had managed to avoid the grasps of the shadow hands. And that was vincent. Strangely, there was no big attack from him or some type of trick or even any special technique.

Instead, just like Peter, when seeing the shadow underneath his feet start to shift, he quickly knelt and placed his palm on top of it, and in the end, the shadow hand had never appeared.

The two of them looked towards Laxmus again, and Vincent could see the guardian he was up against earlier was standing behind the former but was directly staring at him.

"I know what you want me to do... you want me to give up and accept your offer but... I haven't used everything I have yet, and I'm not the type to trust others so easily." Vincent thought.

"Well, it looks like not all of you are useless," Laxmus smiled.

"However, I have lost my patience a little. I know my presence here will bring more of you to me soon, and I am not in the mood to deal with that."

"And since we're meeting after a long time, I will be keeping this weapon as a gift."

It was then that Vincent himself was the one that started to laugh.

"Thank you for holding onto that weapon. Indeed, it is my final gift to you."

Then holding out his hands, Vincent twisted both of them in a circle shape. The second he did that, the sword began to glow bright red, and a red thread appeared that linked directly to Vincent's hand. In the next second, the sword had sprouted multiple lines out. They were so dense that they looked like a pair of wings ready to grab Laxmus, and that was what they did.

The red threads didn't stop shooting out from the sword and had wrapped around every part of Laxmus's body. And when Laxmus tried to break out of the strings he was tied in, it didn't go as easy as he had expected.

"I had that sword for a long time, and I too have been able to figure out the multiple different things that it can do."

On top of that, there was something else that Vincent was able to do with the sword that only he could do, perhaps there was someone else who could do it as well, ut he was one of the few.

Summoning the red aura in his hand, Vincent then created two orbs of red aura. Reacting to this, the sword was also growing redder, still tied to Laxmus's hand, which was exactly what Vincent wanted. Then as he threw both of his arms forward, the red aura headed straight for Laxmus.

In the next instant, it blasted on Laxmus, and the explosions of red aura went off from the sword, covering the entire arena.

The explosions were so intense that Laxmus's whole body was enveloped in them, vanishing him from everyone's sight.

***

# Chapter 1747: Pass it on.

Blood aura could be used in several ways, and over the years, vampires have discovered many uses for it. Hardening the aura to use as armour over their bodies or using it as a pure form of energy to create temporary weapons.

The normal blood attacks can be used, such as the blood slash, which allows them to release the blood energy their bodies created. Some vampires could then use their blood control to move the blood aura or enhance it somehow.

However, the energy while out would dissipate as it hit objects or was in the air, and unless used to take a specific shape, it would just damage the other like a blast. What the others were witnessing was some of the most considerable amounts of blood aura they had seen.

It exploded in one place, where Laxmus once stood. Those that were close moved away but could still feel their skin burning from the energy in front of them, and it was making their stomachs feel a little queasy.

The energy had gone upward and looked like a giant flame ready to pierce the sky. Then, finally, it reached the top of the arena. The people who were outside, seeing this were a little panicked.

"Green City... was meant to be safe. How could something like this happen?" One of them quivered, falling to his knees. The robots that were stationed around wouldn't let anyone enter the arena and stood strong in their position.

"Looking at the report, the only ones that have died were the ones that Laxmus used his shadow on." Logan analysed.

"And from what I can see in the replays, his skill looks and acts similar to Quinn's shadow eater skill."

"So did Laxmus modify the shadow eater skill that also works on humans and has the same effect as it has on the vampires?"

"If that's the case, how many human lives had he made to suffer over the last millennia to get his shadow this strong?"

It was a worrying thought, but seeing that Vincent still had some tricks up his sleeve, he was hopeful that this would be the end of Laxmus, but of course, no matter what, he couldn't let him get to the people.

*** *** ***

The energy started to dissipate and die down, slowly fading away. It was a tense moment for them. All the shadows on the ground had already begun to retract as soon as Vincent started his attack.

The shadow hands binding them had long disappeared, and the shadow was reneging into Laxmus. So whether it vanished because of Laxmus death or not, they weren't so sure. Finally, the dust cleared, and they found nothing in the spot where Laxmus stood earlier, not even his body.

Instead, there was a large hole in the floor of the arena. The hole was deep enough to pass through the vast city platform, and one could look down and see the sea waves cruising.

"He's gone," Jessica said. "That fake Quinn guy... he actually managed to defeat the Red vampire leader. I thought... I thought we were all going to die."

The look on the other's faces showed that they felt the same. Everyone at that moment, when being grabbed by the shadow, something had overcome them. Knowing that no matter what they did, they couldn't escape was a suffocating feeling for them all.

Now there was a sigh of relief on their faces, and they had room to breathe.

"Now... all that's left are those damned Guardians, and the Red Vampires will be done for," Jake said, his hands shaking with anger. Because he, too, had felt the helplessness against Laxmus's shadow.

Meanwhile, Peter was staring at Vincent, who stood upright even after letting out that much blood energy.

"The sword was strong before, but it was never that strong. There is something different and strange about him."

"A vampire using that much energy... even the leaders didn't have this power in the past, and Vincent definitely didn't." Peter thought.

However, Vincent, unlike the others, didn't have a face of relief. Instead, there was a bead of sweat dripping down from the side of his face, and opening his mouth, he suddenly spoke a few words the others never thought they would hear.

"I give up," Vincent coughed.

He spoke seemingly to no one. He wasn't even looking at the guardians that were lined up on the other side.

"I'm the reason you came here, right. So I will leave with you, as long as you cause no harm to the others and this city."

"Otherwise, I won't go down without a fight. Or I will ensure it won't be as easy as you think."

"What are you saying?!" Jessica couldn't help but shout out. "If you're worried about the guardians, we can fight against them. We aren't that weak!"

She couldn't remain calm after hearing Vincent's words. Even though she didn't know why the Red Vampires were here or what they were doing, she knew that they were the ones that had attacked. After seeing this vampire display such resistance against them in the first place and seemingly defeating the biggest threat, she didn't understand what was going on.

That was until a shadow began to appear above the hole that was created a few moments ago. It was dark in colour, almost a solid black like the shadow of the others. Then stepping out from it was Laxmus, who flapped his large wings on his back a few times, hovering in place.

He held the sword in his hand, which was still transformed and was surging with the white energy. but the rest of Laxmus's body was just fine.

"He used the shadow lock to avoid the attack." Vincent had realised this before.

"I was hoping he would be confident in his skills to try and take it head-on... but Laxmus is much more cautious than I thought. With the shadow and his strength, there is too much risk."

Flying over the large hole, Laxmus landed on the arena and retracted his wings back into his body while twisting his head from side to side.

"I will take you up on your offer," Laxmus said with a smile. "Besides, you have given me a nice gift to take back."

Vincent started walking over to where Laxmus was, but of course, others began to move. For one, Peter had taken a step, and the rest were ready to follow.

"Don't be an idiot," Vincent suddenly said.

"I know you have been reckless for most of your lives, and all of you want to act with your feelings, but you should use your heads for once. This is the right choice... the only one to make."

"And do you all want to die here? Then imagine what would happen next." Vincent added without turning back, not looking at the others.

But it sounded like his words had gotten through because not a single one of them moved forward.

The shadow on Laxmus's back was still active till this point, but seeing how they were listening to Vincent, he decided to put it away. Behind them, on the row of guardians who had earlier fought against Vincent.

A mask obscured his face, but underneath it, there was a sigh of relief from him as well.

"Thank you for doing the right thing, Vincent. I promise that Layla and I will do everything we can when you are back to protect you."

"No matter what, we can't let Laxmus get his hands on the Red Heart."

Eventually, Vincent stopped and looked up to Laxmus. "I hope you are a man of your word."

"Don't worry, I am," Laxmus replied. "In return for you, I will not harm them or the people in this city. You are the only person I need in the first place, anyway."

Suddenly, Laxmus thrusted his black hand that was still active at that moment. It moved at lightning speed, faster than the others had seen Laxmus move before, and even Vincent failed to react in time as his eyes were wide open.

Blood suddenly spilled out of his mouth, and he coughed up. In the next instant, everyone found that Laxmus's hand had gone right through Vincent's chest, and on the other side was a red crystal in Laxmus's hand.

"My time is over now!" Vincent struggled to say, he knew it was already too late, but a smile appeared on his face.

"I'm sorry I couldn't pass it on to you, and I'm sorry I couldn't apologise for everything that happened, but it's all up to you now, Quinn."

***

# Chapter 1748: Less than 1 percent.

Logan continued to monitor everything from his main base, his research laboratory. But, honestly, even while watching the whole event take part, he was working on other things. Due to his ability, he was just able to split his attention and multitask.

So he could see the events taking place and give orders to the robots outside the event, all while coding and writing information for new inventions and projects, but for the first time in a while, he was no longer using his ability. Instead, his mind and body froze as his fingers hovered over the keyboard.

That was because he had just seen what had happened to Vincent. He was in disbelief but perhaps not for the reasons others thought. Although Logan did care for Vincent somewhat, the two of them were never close, and it was also because of what was in Laxmus's hand, which had gone through Vincent's body. It was the Red Heart they had been looking for.

"Vincent had it all along, as I thought. It was strange that he could use such strong blood powers, but I didn't think he was hiding it inside himself."

"What kind of experiments was he doing with the red heart?" Logan thought.

Quickly, he rewinded the whole video of the incident and played it in slow motion. He could see Laxmus with his hand pierce through Vincent's body with ease, but there was something unexpected. After hitting Vincent's chest, Laxmus's hand hit a Nest crystal.

It had an outer casing that looked like the universe and space itself. Then, before anyone else could see, Laxmus had closed his hands slightly. The crystal had smashed like glass, only to reveal the red crystal.

"How could he hide the red crystal in the Nest crystal... Vincent, how many experiments did you do during this time?"

"You were trying your best not to let them get the crystal. You were also always fighting in your way." Logan clenched his fists hard and lifted them in the air.

"Why! Has! This! Happened! In my own city! I can't even protect my own people!" Logan slammed his hands down on his desk, breaking his keyboard off the hinge and smashing it onto the floor.

"Everyone, do whatever you can to ensure Laxmus doesn't leave this place! Use everything we have!"

Immediately, he sent out the message to those in Green city, and all the factions had already decided to get to work. At the same time, the Travellers received news of a bounty, an enormous bounty, on the person who was the Leader of the Red Vampires, Laxmus.

Now confirmed, and with a clear video and picture, Logan could put out the request officially. All the robots protecting the people and stopping others from entering started to use their energy to fly in the air and were heading to regroup at one location: the arena.

Meanwhile, at the same time, Logan wasn't just doing nothing. So far, he had been keeping an eye on things, not acting himself, because, truth be told, Logan could see no way, even with his help, even with his technology and strength, of defeating Laxmus.

Running the simulations repeatedly, the chances of him changing their circumstances were less than one percent, which was why he thought he could help in other ways, but now he had opened a particular room in his lab.

"I'm sorry, Quinn, I was wrong. If you were here, you wouldn't have listened to the percentages and chances of winning. I have to do something."

*** *** ***

On the arena ground itself, Laxmus could see the people entering through the stage where the crowd had been overlooking the event. The robots flying in the air surrounding them all.

"I guess that is my time to leave. I have what I wanted, and as promised, I am a man of my word." Lemus started, pulling his hand out from Vincent's body, letting the latter drop to the ground.

He fell on the arena, putting up nearly no resistance, and the back of his body just hit the floor, and his hands fell to the side. Blood was pouring slowly from his back.

In the next second and the shadow shrouded Laxmus and the other Guardians. It enveloped them like flames, and before anyone could react, the shadow disappeared, leaving no one on the spot. They were gone.

"We have to help the fake Quinn!" Minny shouted.

Everyone decided and ran over to where Vincent was, including Peter. Not knowing what they could do, but in the end, the one that had reached him first was someone else.

Crashing down in a white suit of armour was what looked like another AI robot. Only it was different from all the others. It had several gold details and a golden mask that was made of one piece covering its face.

Opening up though, to everyone's surprise, including Jake Green, it was his father, Logan Green.

"I'm sorry...I didn't come soon enough." Logan then opened up his arm and fired out a strange object. It was small to start with but started to spread out and looked somewhat like a large mechanical spider.

It hit Vincent right in his chest and had wrapped around it, covering the hole on his chest.

"Logan... how did he manage to get here so fast... is it the suit?" Peter thought as he also reached Vincent.

However, Peter was more annoyed that Logan hadn't chosen to help them and came when it was too late. But he knew it wasn't the time for them to be fighting against each other because they needed to focus on Vincent and save him anyhow.

"What is that thing?" Jake asked about the spider.

"It creates nano machines that will try and repair the damage to his body. It also will give him a supply of blood, but I'll be honest, I don't think it will be enough." Logan replied.

"It would be good if you could find anyone with any healing ability and do what you can to save him."

Jake didn't need to be asked twice as he already had gone off.

"What do you mean?" Hannah asked, now that the others had surrounded Vincent, who was on the floor. "I know it's a bad wound but with blood and all this help, won't he be okay?"

"No." Logan shook his head. "He isn't the same as the rest of you. There is a reason why he looks like Quinn."

"Truth be told, his body should have deteriorated, and he should have died long ago. We don't have Shiro right now, either."

"Without the nest crystal, there is a good chance that even with all this help, we could just be helping out an empty shell."

The others didn't quite know what Logan was talking about. After all, he was just answering what had come to his head without thinking about those around him. Still, they understood that it was a difficult situation and the chances of Vincent's survival were almost negligible.

The little robot that Logan had used started to imitate a heartbeat. It shook Vincent's whole body on its own, giving him chest compressions. Yet, there was still no response.

Walking over, Logan knelt down in his armour and was by Vincent's side.

"Can I still save you... if I give you mine?" Logan said out loud, but without context, they didn't know what he was talking about.

"After all, I have gone past my time. I hit my limit long ago. In fact, you have done more for the people than I have by hiding the red heart for so long."

"Don't be ridiculous!" Vicky cried immediately upon hearing these words, "Are you just going to leave me then?"

"Do you think that he didn't know what he was getting into? Don't sacrifice your life for his, not when you don't even know if it will work."

Just as she had finished, a shadow suddenly appeared in front of the group, putting everyone at.

And as the shadow subsided, they were even more shocked to see one of the Red Vampire Guardians stepping out. It was the same guardian who had fought against Vincent earlier. Before anyone could react, he opened his mouth and revealed his intentions.

"Please, let me take him with me... I can take him somewhere that might be able to help him."

# Chapter 1749: Remember me.

"You're confident coming back here without the rest of your bunch and that damned Vampire!" Peter shouted.

His body was already transforming, and his legs had already kicked off the ground while he readied his fist to throw a punch at the Guardian's face.

After all, Peter and the others were somewhat restricted from concentrating because of these Guardians. However, even without Laxmus, the individuals proved strong due to their shadow power. Getting rid of them now would solve some of their future troubles.

But when Peter's fist got closer, he noticed something. The air around his fist was becoming denser, and the image of the Guardian was starting to distort in front of his eyes, looking like it was forming into waves.

That's when the vision around him started to disappear, as everything was becoming some type of mist. Peter no longer had a target and was lost, not knowing where to strike. He wasn't the only one, though. The others in the arena could not find the Guardian either.

As they stood in thick mist, the most they could see were the hands if they put out in front of them. As for the others beside them, they couldn't see anyone in the dense mist.

"You seriously don't believe I would blow this damn fog away?!" Peter shouted as the aura gathered around his fist.

"Please, I am not here to fight but only to help! I know you care for Vincent, and so do I. Peter, I know we didn't communicate much but don't you recognize me of all people?" The Guardian asked.

Peter was moving his head, trying to pinpoint where the voice was coming from, but as if he were in a large tunnel, the sound was echoing from all directions, making it impossible for him to pinpoint where it was coming from. At the same time, sensing the guardians' energy didn't seem to work either.

"This doesn't make sense," Hannah said, loud enough for the others to hear.

"Is this person really a Guardian? This fog must be an ability, but all Guardians know how to use the shadow."

It certainly was strange, and Logan had caught on quite quickly. When the Guardian first appeared, instead of going on the aggression as Peter had, Logan used his specially designed speed suit to boost himself to Vincent's side and grabbed one of his limbs.

His grip was still tight as he wondered what this Guardian wanted.

"He has come on his own and is not with the others, so maybe he was telling the truth? If there was just some way to confirm it." Logan thought.

"Because the longer we do nothing, the worse it is for Vincent."

While Peter was frantically swinging his head and his fist around, finally, he could see something forming from the mist.

"You have to recognise me!" The Guardian said, taking off the mask and revealing his face.

For a second, Peter had stopped to observe, but it had only taken him a second to decide.

"I don't know you, so you can just disappear!" Peter shouted.

A short pause saw him go through the mist right up to the Guardian's face. The only thing was Peter wasn't holding back, and he was far too annoyed about too many things, Laxmus had gotten away, they were about to lose Vincent, and the burning sensation still left on his skin constantly made him feel itchy.

With his celestial energy, the fist slammed the Guardian's face, and in an instant, a strange look appeared on Peter's. He could tell something was wrong.

"I don't feel any weight... that's not him." Peter thought.

Either way, the punch was still one that Peter didn't hold back with, and as it finished, everyone heard a loud bang, as if a cannon had gone off. It had created a circle in the mist, and less than a second later, the mist blew away, out of the arena as if it was never there.

That's when everyone has a clear look at the Guardian in front of them. "Damn it! I thought everyone here would at least recognise me." The Guardian complained about his as everyone stared at his face.

"I can't believe you would rely on him to recognise you instead of me," Logan said, walking forward.

"Although he was always around Quinn's side, don't you know that his memory is like that of a goldfish?"

Stopping for a second, Peter looked at the person again. Even while trying to imagine what everyone in his memory bank would look like after a thousand years, he still couldn't pinpoint who the person in front of them was.

"I know you as well. You originally belonged to the first family and then moved up your ranks in the tenth family." Muka said, walking forward. "You are Xander."

There was a sigh of relief from Xander that quite a few people had recognized him. He still looked close to his age before, around fifteen, only slightly older. Skilled vampires could, as long as it wasn't too long in their life, control what age they wished to look like well.

Why Xander had chosen this age was his choice, either way, it had worked out for him.

"You were part of the tenth family and helped run the place frequently with Timmy. Is that why you wish to help Vincent?" Logan asked.

This, in reality, was a trap because Logan knew that Xander wasn't part of the tenth family when Vincent was in charge. Right now, someone could be using a name and appearance to trick them. Logan was cautious after all these years, and he had to ensure the right person was in front of him.

"Look, there really isn't time for me to explain all of this if you want Vincent to live!" Xander replied.

"I don't really care for him that much, but I will listen to whatever Layla says, and if she wants me to save Vincent, then that's just what I'll do."

The others were ready to act at any second. They had their weapons drawn. After going through what they had been through, they would never trust anyone who was linked to the Red Vampires or the Guardians again.

"I'm not stupid. I know you can forcefully beat me." Xander replied.

"And, I know you might not like me, Peter, because we got on the wrong foot, but believe in us. Believe in Layla"

Ultimately, it came down to Logan to make the decision. He was holding Vincent, and his little spider-like device was active on the latter's body.

"If I'm by his side, then there will be even more chance of his survival, so take me with you," Logan asked.

This surprised the others, and whether they thought it was the right thing to do or not would be saved for another time, and it didn't matter anyway due to Xander's answer.

"No, I can't do that, We can't just bring people to the Red Vampires base. If people were to find out... that would be a disaster for us all, and we already have enough on our plate to deal with anyway."

It looked like Logan had made his decisions as his grip weakened, and he slowly placed Vincent on the floor.

"Do whatever it takes to keep him alive." Logan stepped away, and the others did nothing.

They knew they had no chance if Logan couldn't save him, so it was most likely the best thing to do for Vincent himself.

Quickly, Xander walked up to Vincent's body and grabbed onto him. In the next moment, shadows began shrouding both of them, and his head was the last part to obscure.

"I hope we will meet again." Xander was gone.

Some of the others fell to their knees in exhaustion, believing it was over and had to be over. Yet, at the same time, some felt defeated by what happened.

"What are you planning to do now?" Muka asked. "What's your next step? The Red Vampires just left in front of us."

That was when Muka could see a smile appear on Logan's face. "That device that was on Vincent's chest, Xander took it with him."

"The device just revealed its location to me. So we will return the favour they have done to us tenfold."

Looking over to Vicky, Logan nodded before saying. "Contact the Blades and tell them to call Sil"
