# Chapter 1500 - This Is Our King?
It took a few hours for them to finally reach the planet, and honestly Quinn was quite pleased by the fact for more reasons than one. He had felt really uncomfortable around all the vampires. Whenever he would walk past, they would give him glares here and there.

At the same time, others would get out of his way or leave the room when he entered. Not that Quinn was the talkative type or anything, but it was clear they were treating him differently, and the thing was he knew it wasn't because they were being rude, it was the opposite.

"I guess that's what it's like to be King? I'm happy that everyone on the Cursed faction treats me well, and surprisingly, I'm happy that he's here as well." Quinn said, looking up at Jesk.

The ship was landing, and Quinn was waiting to get off by the back of the ship where the ramp would descend. By his side was Jesk, who felt like the only person he could talk to.

'Wait, I just realised, have I just been replacing the voices in my head with Jesk?' Quinn started to think back to how everyone was treating him on the ship. Quinn had often talked to the gorilla when he had troubles, but the gorilla had done and would only grunt at times.

"I think I am going crazy with all these past voices in my head, huh, Jesk?" Quinn asked out loud, looking at the gorilla again. He wasn't even aware how this comment made him look to the other vampires, starting to worry about him.

Getting off the ship, Quinn could see that the world's air here wasn't exactly pleasant. Everything seemed to be covered in a slight green smog, and the planet smelt like wet mud. It was then that Quinn noticed that the ship had landed on what looked like one of the few pieces of land.

When staring out far, he could hardly see any land anywhere, and even his feet were now sinking slightly into the soft mud. That was because almost the entire planet was similar to a large swamp. It was covered in water, but it looked even dirtier than the ones on Earth and ts the water looked to be made of a thicker substance.

"Sorry that we couldn't bring you closer." Ronsten apologised, seeing the look on Quinn's face. "As you know, the beasts are far more frequent near the Nest Crystal, and we can't risk them damaging the ship.

"We had initially set up the teleporter and tried to retrieve the crystal, but since it proved too difficult, we retreated. Upon returning, the teleporter had been destroyed. If we had more people, we might have left some to guard the teleporter, but given our force splitting them seemed like a bad idea."

"I understand." Quinn cut them off. "I'm guessing the ship can't go through the water too well either."

The Vampire King watched everyone get into action. Viscount Norvic led a group of four vampire, whereas Viscount Nian led a group of five, while the Earl stayed quite close to Quinn. It seemed like he was taking his duty quite seriously to protect the King.

Although they had split into two groups, they weren't far away. It was just how they had been trained to fight, covering each other's back and so on.

When Quinn stepped into the swamp area, the water came just below his knees, and the substance he could tell was quite thick. It slowed down his movements in his legs ever so slightly, although Jesk was dealing with it with relative ease.

He even offered to let Quinn ride on his back, but he had refused as he wanted to get used to the strange water.

"Ah crap, do we really have to do this again!" Moe complained as he stared left and right. There were quite a lot of swamp trees in the area that would have vines in them. Sometimes there were few vines allowing them to see quite far off into the land, while others there were too many trees with the vines making it hard for them to see anything.

"Come on, is it really that scary fighting against yourself? Besides this time I'm going to beat her!" Joy cheerfully proclaimed, pumping her fist. The other vampires following from behind found it quite cute.

The next second though, they could see the vines moving apart, and what looked like a mix between a frog and a giant hippo swimming through. Its body was large, but its face had puffed out its cheeks.

"Beasts, prepare for attack!" Norvic shouted out.

Quinn had been warned beforehand that the closer they came to the crystal, the more beasts they would encounter, so he was sure that this wouldn't be the only one.

"Your Majesty, let us deal with this, so you can save your strength for the-'' Before Ronsten could finish his sentence a tongue wrapped around his face while he was distracted. Using his hands though, he was able to rip it off, but there were plenty of beasts, and it looked like no one had time to be worrying about the other.

Soon, another frog had tried to latch its tongue towards Quinn, but before it reached his head, Jesk had thrown one of its arm out to intercept the tongue, causing it to wrap around its forearm. With another hands it held onto the tongue and pulled it forward causing the creature's fat body to fly in the air and the next second it hammered it down with its fist punching it and causing water to gush up.

"I will be fine, focus on yourself." Quinn advised, as he began to observe everyone around him. He wanted to see their strength for more reasons than one. Right now, they were just guiding him to the place, but if they couldn't hold their own, then perhaps it would be safer for Quinn to place them in his Shadow space and just leave them be for now.

The beasts were at the Emperor tier level, but there were a lot of them. Seeing how everyone seemed to be doing fine on their own, Quinn wanted to test something, and he soon sprinted towards two of the hippo frogs that were in front of him.

Although they had large bodies, somehow they could sink into the ground even though it wasn't so deep, and when doing so, he could tell that they moved quite fast. Some of the others weren't really paying attention to their own fight, instead having chosen to watch their King's action.

The frogs began their attack, popping up like moles from the water and would shoot out their tongues. Here Quinn would avoid them, but only just. He was doing this constantly, not getting hit once.

Then after some time had passed he ran up to one of the beasts, it opened its mouth wide and attempted to bite Quinn. Despite their bulky size, the beast was quick, and its jaw had chomped down, biting the vampire's arm.

He had his gauntlet on, and it was unable to pierce it, even with its strong jaws.

'Now that I know your strength, let's test a few things.' Quinn thought to himself, placing his other gauntlet on the frog. Then he started to absorb the energy.

After that, Quinn went to the other frog that was attacking him and gave it the energy he had just collected, just like he had done with Jesk when he had fought the grey gorilla. He then allowed himself to be hit by the tongue.

The others watching this were surprised. They had no clue what Quinn was doing. He was still testing the limits of his gauntlet and just how much power he could give them, and take away. What effect it would have in the end.

He intended to test out the capabilities of his improved equipment, but for those watching, they could just see someone getting hit by low level beasts, unable to comprehend his action.

"Was it really borrowed power?" Moe asked out loud.

"No, he hasn't used any of his blood powers, this must be some sort of training!" Rick argued back, while slashing the face off another frog.

"Yeah, but he still sucks!" Joy shouted, as she dodged another frog.

Eventually all the beasts had been defeated and in the end, for some reason, Jesk had been the one who had killed the two frogs Quinn had been fighting.

This was because after his little test, Quinn had given the leftover energy to Jesk since he no longer needed it. He was curious to find out if he could help his new friend evolve once again, by continuously feeding him energy. Of course, he would keep in mind not to overdo it, he himself knew better than anyone what an imbalance of power could do to one's body.

To the others, though, they were starting to think the rumours were really true. Even the Viscounts and the Earl were concerned. Continuing their travels, Quinn noticed that this time not only was the Earl by his side, but so were the two Viscounts.

"I have a question to ask, can the doppelgangers copy abilities?" Quinn wondered, unaware of what was happening.

The surrounding area had become clear, almost void of trees. They were just walking in the strange sludge when a plop was heard. A very loud plop.

The water itself rose, and it looked like it was forming into something. Straight away, Ronsten stood in front of Quinn, and a few seconds later a copy of him appeared in front of him, blocking their path.

"I guess I'm about to find out." Quinn smiled.

*****

# Chapter 1501 - Progressive Beasts
There was something about this planet which was different to the other beast planets that Quinn had been to in the past and the beasts that he had encountered. For one, the strange sludge that he was in was making it difficult for him to use his ears to dictate where the beasts were coming from.

At the same time, when he tried to use his Qi to sense energy it was as if there was a constant energy running through the sludge itself, but it wasn't enough for Quinn to bother using his gauntlet on either. Now of all things, the dangerous beast that they all were afraid of, and that he had been warned about, had suddenly appeared in front of them.

Out from the strange water, its body had formed in seconds, creating an identical copy of Ronsten. What shocked Quinn even more was that it was impossible to tell the difference between the two. It was an identical copy down to the last hair strand, and somehow they were even able to emulate the smell that the vampires emitted.

[Inspect]

[Progressive beast discovered]

[Your system has made a new discovery!]

[10,000 exp points received]

'Progressive beast? I've never heard of such a thing before. What does that even mean?' Quinn wondered. The system was breaking down the knowledge that Quinn had obtained in school, the knowledge they had been taught in their military academy.

At the end of the day, Quinn realised that these beast planets in this solar system aren't exactly the same as the ones in the beast solar system. At the same time, beast planets were a new discovery, and just like the crystals, beasts themselves seemed to be things they were learning more about every day.

The system didn't seem like it was able to answer Quinn's questions, and he had suddenly turned to his gorilla friend, as if he was going to ask it a question like he would do Ray or Vincent, but he knew there would be no such luck as he slapped his forehead.

'What am I thinking?'

When what was about to occur, Quinn was wondering why the others hadn't stepped forward yet, and had decided to stay a few feet back. For now, he decided to do the same as he watched carefully.

Ronsten decided to strike at the doppelganger, aming for its throat. It was a deathly blow aimed to kill it in one strike, but it was soon blocked, and the doppelganger had done the same in return.

Blocking the sma attack, Ronsten this time grabbed it by the wrist and threw the other over its shoulder only to perfectly land in the water unharmed. The two continued a high speed battle, just mainly using their fists. No blood attacks or abilities seemed to be used, and both of them were even in battle.

'So the beast can match up to the Earl's strength, and speed. Otherwise, it wouldn't be able to stop the attacks, but why isn't he using any abilities?'

Watching carefully, it looked like the two Viscounts were getting ready to make a move, then at the same time they charged in.

"Now!" The Earl shouted as he jumped back and both of them went for the strike. They pierced the doppelganger's chest, and now Ronsten went forward, striking its throat once more and killing it this time.

There was no blood from its wounds, but it looked like a fatal blow would make the doppelganger look like it was melting as it fell into the water. Ronsten looked a bit panicked as he went back to the others.

"From here on out, we have to tread carefully, Your Majesty." Ronsten explained. "We have found no way to tell where the doppelgangers appear from, and we were very lucky that this time there was only a single one. As we move through the swamp, more will appear. As you can see, fighting one of my own was difficult enough if I was to come face to face with two or three of me…"

Now Quinn understood why everyone was a little cautious to move forward. It was in case they had entered the nest area. Logan had explained to Quinn that there was a radius the beasts seemed to operate in, when protecting the nest.

They wouldn't move out from this area, and it looked like they had just crossed the borderline. Stepping in could have summoned more.

"But why didn't you use your ability, is it for the same reason?" Quinn asked.

"Not quite. Unfortunately, using Blood energy or abilities seems to attract those buggers to us." Norvic answered. "Last time, they suddenly surrounded us. They can't copy our abilities, but the second we use them, more and more start to appear.

"We were lucky to have managed to get out alive."

There was another thing that Quinn noticed after the beast had been defeated, it had dropped no crystal. Quinn pondered if those things might actually be something similar to how the Demon tier Tree has used the Marked.

Still, if Quinn could grab onto one of these progressive beasts, then maybe a copy of him would have a large amount of energy he could steal from it. The excitement was growing in Quinn already.

Worst case, he believed his gauntlet might be the perfect weapon against this type of enemy. He could just share his energy with the others to make it, so they could beat their counterparts. As long as the beast's energy didn't increase as well, of course.

"We don't know why, but as long as we don't use our abilities, at most a clone is created for each of us who enters." Nian explained. "When we got close, a clone was created of each of us, and we believe the same thing will occur again. It was only after we used our abilities more arrived. So past this point we should avoid using our abilities and try to work together during our own fights to help each other.

"The Earl is one of the strongest so he might need the most help, but we will try to swap opponents midway before the beast can notice and adapt and kill each other's counterparts."

Looking at the others, Quinn noticed that none of them were wearing beast gear either. Although the beast were able to match their strength and speed for some reason, the Vampire King couldn't imagine that they would be able to copy the abilities of beast gear as well. It only reassured him in his belief that he would be able to beat his own counterpart.

Yet, for some reason, he felt like if he were to use any of these things, he would be cheating himself.

The group walked forward, and now the groups were making a little more sense to Quinn. He imagined that many of them had been practising each other's fighting styles, so they could kill the other clones rather than themselves.

'That's a problem… if my copy really will be as strong as me, even if it will just be my base stats… I doubt anyone here could beat it.' Quinn thought. At the same time, the Earl was staying close to him because he had a similar yet different thought.

'I don't know how strong His Majesty's clone will be, but if he were to fight mine, he could be in for some trouble. We will have to try to finish him off first and the others later if we are to stand a chance of winning this.'

It wasn't long until the sound of several loud drops was heard again, more than one this time. From the water, more doppelgangers were emerging. Just like what had been explained, a copy of each person had been created, there was even a version of the giant gorilla standing opposite Jesk.

The fighting between all of them had begun, yet a clone hadn't appeared in front of Quinn for some reason. Ronsten, noticing this, had no choice but to abort his plan and try to face him for a while for the time being.

'Huh, I was actually looking forward to fighting myself?' Quinn sighed. 'I wonder what happened? Am I too strong for them to copy?'

While watching the others fight, Quinn was ready to initiate his plan until he noticed something. He hadn't really been paying attention, but due to how close the doppelgangers looked between one another… Quinn had no idea which one was the real or fake one.

[Inspect]

'What…my inspect skill, it's bringing up the same person for both of them now…' Realising this, Quinn also realised using this shadow lock wouldn't help in this situation either, because he didn't know which one was the fake…

Finally, in front of Quinn, he could see himself merging out of the water, and a smile appeared in front of the clone's face. The next second, a fist was thrown out so fast, hitting him right in the stomach.

He was sent through the air and fell back crashing into the water.

"What the hell!" Moe shouted, noticing who had just flown by. "Is he that weak that he can't even beat himself?"

Ironically, it was quite the opposite, the clone was strong… just as strong as their King.

# Chapter 1502 - Quinn Vs Quinn
Just like last time, everyone seemed to be having a tough time against their counterpart. Although their plan was to help out each other by switching opponents for a short time, it was almost like their enemies were prepared for this and made it impossible to find an opening. At times they would even move so they could block their way. Not only were their movesets the same but so were their thoughts. Making them worry that their plan might not work out as they intended.

Meanwhile, Jesk and his doppelganger didn't rely on any particular strategy, instead opting to use brute strength. Their fight wasn't too different from the gorilla having fought the grey member of his species back on the Vampire Planet, only that he and his counterpart had three pairs of hands each. Unable to overwhelm the other, they had entered a dogfight, exchanging their fists and at this rate, both the beasts would end up falling eventually.

Quinn, who had been whacked away from where the others had been fighting, quickly got up from the ground, only to find his own doppelganger rushing towards him.

'Well, at least now I won't have to worry about it going for any of the others.' Quinn thought, as he readied himself to do combat. The first thing the doppelganger did, now that it had reached the Vampire King, was a thigh kick. Seeing this, Quinn was in the middle of deciding what to do. Whether he should block it or not, but his natural reaction in seeing this was to send out a kick himself.

Both of the legs clashed, shin on shin, hitting each other and sending out a shockwave of strength. The sludge that they were standing in had created a small wave that was being sent outward.

'Damn, the first hit he got on me was because I was distracted but that kick just now proves it. He didn't just copy my base stats, but seems to have copied my strength with the best gear on!' Quinn shockingly realised, as he continued to attack his doppelganger counterpart.

Quinn wasn't holding back when using his speed or strength, though he wasn't using his Qi energy either. He was afraid that this might attract the other beasts towards their location. Their group was having a tough time dealing with one doppelganger each, no need to add to their numbers.

At the moment, he hadn't seen the Nest crystal yet, and until he did. He doesn't want to risk attracting them all.

'Besides… let's see if there is a way I can beat myself.' Quinn decided.

With his palm in a claw-like shape, Quinn was attempting to grab the beast and absorb the energy. He wanted to test his theory to see if the beast also had the same energy as himself. When he threw out his hand, though, the Quinn in front of him had disappeared with a flash step.

The next second, the doppelganger reappeared behind him. Quinn quickly turned around and whacked the fists of the opponent away, attempting to kick him in the stomach, but this move was avoided as well. It was going to be a tough fight.

——

Meanwhile, a little away from where Quinn was, the others were struggling, but they needed to initiate their plan soon.

"Damn this ugly bastard!" Moe cursed.

"Have you never taken a look in a mirror, that's exactly what you look like in real life!" Joy shouted back as she backflipped, avoiding a punch, and charged right in, throwing a fury of punches herself. Her doppelganger did the same, and their fists were colliding with each other head on.

"Don't we have to try to see if His Majesty is okay? The fog has gotten thick around here, and it's hard to see. I'm a little worried." Rick voiced his concerns to the others. Unlike the others, he wasn't attacking so much and just avoiding the blow until the order was given.

"The King will have to help himself, if we break formation we'll all die!" Norvic shouted in frustration. A few moments later, Earl Ronston finally gave the signal.

"Switch!" Norvic shouted. It was time to put the plan into action.

———

Quinn had been fighting his doppelganger only for a short while but during that time he had tried out a number of different things to get the advantage, his Muay Baron skills, the vampire fighting skills, and even the military training he had received.

Unfortunately, it looked like the doppelganger knew everything that he did, meaning that they clashed without a real winner. The fight felt like it could go on forever, and it didn't look like Quinn could outsmart the beast.

"I really wanted to play and try to find some way to beat you fairly, but I'm afraid the others really need my help." Quinn sighed, as he charged in once again. However, this time he aimed for the body, the largest part of Doppelganger Quinn.

When attacking, he didn't slow down, ignoring the possible retaliation. The doppelganger aimed at the same region as the Vampire King. It was at that moment that two powerful blows struck their stomachs at the same time.

'So this is what it feels like to take a punch from myself.' Quinn grunted with a bit of blood trickling from his mouth, but the doppelganger was clearly hurt as well. Smiling, Quinn threw another punch holding on, and they were both hit once again.

'Alright, let's back it up a little.' Quinn thought as he stepped back and pulled the flask out from his side. Of all things, he had never imagined that this would come in handy now of all times.

If Blood skills attracted attention, Quinn was worried about the blood armour as well, but he knew the flask that had nothing but blood in it wouldn't be the same, and there was one thing that the doppelganger looked like it couldn't do and that was heal.

'Alright, time to finish this.' Quinn thought.

——

Following the command, just like they had practised, each one of them broke off, and went to attack the doppelganger of another vampire. The two Viscounts were going to help the Earl quickly, helping him face the toughest opponent. Meanwhile, the group went on the defensive but switched opponents.

"Haha, I'm so happy I got to smash your ugly face in!" Joy shouted as she continued to punch Moe, again and again.

Each of the group had revealed their weaknesses to each other. Maybe they couldn't beat themselves in a fight, but their plan seemed to be working. Of course, with the Viscounts gone they were struggling and unable to deal with them but defending and just holding on was a different story.

In the end, the two Viscounts along with the Earl were able to deal with his doppelganger once again, and quickly rushed back to help out the rest. Now outnumbering the beasts, they were easily able to get rid of the rest of the doppelgangers including the one Jesk had been fighting to a standstill.

Finally, the group had defeated all the beasts, and they just needed a moment to catch their breath. Some of them were hurt but not nearly as bad as the previous time.

"Is everyone okay, where is his Majesty?" Ronsten asked.

They all nodded and looked off in the direction Quinn had flown off to. The fog behind them had gotten thick that they were unable to see. Walking through the mist, though, eventually they could see Quinn walking through and waving at them all. He had a little blood on his armour, but mostly looked uninjured.

"He must have gotten lucky if he managed to take care of his beast." Moe commented.

Meeting up with the others, Quinn was happy to see that their plan worked, but he was wondering how they should progress next. In the middle of this thought, a sound was heard.

*Plop *Plop *Plop

Each of them looked at each other in horror, for it sounded like they were about to go for another round against the doppelgangers.

"It's okay!" Nian shouted. "We went against them once, we can do it again. We have a plan now!"

A metre away, the beasts started to form in front of them, but this time something was different. As they began to take shape, a lot of them noticed that it no longer looked like them. Instead, they all had taken the form of Earl Ronsten.

"What is this?" Joy asked, her hands shaking in fear. "This didn't happen before."

"They must have taken the form of the strongest one of us? Were they just playing games before? If we all have to fight the Earl, none of us will win against him."

*BANG*

A loud slapping sound was heard, as if something had smacked into water. When tilting their heads to see what had just happened, they could see the King, Quinn, standing in front of a headless Earl.

"This is much easier than fighting myself." Quinn announced with a large grin.

The others couldn't believe it, but Rick had seen it. He had been watching the King, and so had the Earl. It was a single punch. Faster than the Ronston would be able to move or react, and based on the strength, it had the power to kill him in one hit.


"Remind me which one of you said the king was weak again? I think we're about to see a massacre." Rick smiled.

*****

# Chapter 1503 - Invincible Army
Even though the others hadn't seen what Quinn had done, the fact that there was now one less doppelganger of the Earl in front of them, they had no choice but to believe it was their King's doing. At the same time, they had their own fights to worry about.

The doppelgangers immediately started to strike at the person in front of them. Those that were less skilful, all they could do was block while making sure to protect their more vulnerable places.

They were getting hurt, and if they didn't do something soon, they would be in serious trouble. Some were getting desperate and thinking of attacking, but before they could the Viscount gave them words of encouragement.

"Just keep defending for now!" Norvic shouted. "We will find a way to deal with them!"

It was at that moment, the Viscount splitting his attention off of the Ronston doppelganger, that his opponent had hit him in the stomach. It was a powerful hit that nearly made him kneel to the ground, but tensing his stomach at the last moment, he somewhat managed to lighten the blow.

"I guess having a large belly isn't always a bad thing." Norvic commented, as he grabbed the Earl's wrist and twisted the skin together, trying to rip it apart. Although it did some damage in retaliation, it looked like the doppelganger of the Earl was ready to strike the Viscount's head.

'If I don't use my abilities…then I'll be dead. We have to use it and refocus.'

"Not just yet." A voice warned as it grabbed the hand of the doppelganger. Looking at whom it was, Norvic could see that it was His Majesty. Quinn was holding onto it tightly, and it wasn't budging an inch, either.

With its other hand, it looked like the doppelganger was attempting to hit him again, but it moved ever so slightly before Quinn grabbed hold of that one as well.

"Go on, I'm letting you punch this one. It hit you, so give it your best shot." Quinn said. The doppelganger tried to struggle free, but with one kick his legs were broken. The bodies that they transformed into, although lacking any blood, still behaved like the bodies they copied.

Not wasting time and wanting to help the others, Norvic was more than happy to deliver a finishing blow, striking the Earl in the head with both his fists.

"You help your group, whileI'll go help Nian." Quinn ordered. Heading over that way, Norvic couldn't help but think about what he had just seen, and he smiled to himself.

'I was an idiot. I wonder who even spread those rumours in the first place. The King being weak… if that had been true, how would the other leaders have accepted him? I doubt any of it had been borrowed power…he is just that strong.'

Quinn had landed in the middle of the vampires and Viscount Nian, who had formed a circle. This way they couldn't get attacked from behind. Jumping again, he positioned himself in the middle of the circle in between both sides.

He soon left again, jumping the vampires and kicked two of the viscounts head's. The strength of a single attack of his was able to finish them off.

Seeing this, the others could finally catch a break and could just see Quinn smiling back at them. They had fought the doppelgangers. They knew that it could replicate their strength, and they had faced the Earl's hits that were anything but weak.

They doubted even the leaders without using their abilities could deal with an Earl so easily. Then suddenly, the real Earl himself was hurled across the water. Like a thrown stone, he skipped on the top of it several times, crashing and causing waves to rise up.

It forced many of them to turn and look at what was happening, and they noticed that their own doppelgangers had stopped their advance as well.

'The Earl shouldn't be able to do that to himself, I can smell blood as well. I have a feeling that we might just have a serious problem on our hands.' Quinn thought.

Looking at where Ronston had come from, the Vampire King saw what looked like a replica of himself. It had taken a while for Quinn to get a doppelganger to face him, but this just made Quinn worry even more.

The other doppelgangers had stopped advancing because, once again, they were all changing forms… this time into Quinn. Each of them had a slight smirk on their face as only one side of their mouths would lift slightly.

"Moe… I'm a little scared." Joy admitted, as she looked at His Majesty in front of her.

Norvic, seeing those under him frightened, didn't know what to do. Now that he knew the King wasn't weak at all and after seeing what had happened to Earl Ronston, the strongest vampire after Quinn, he was afraid they would all be doomed. At the same time, it looked like every single one of them were ready to strike.

They threw their fists fast towards each one, but before their fists could connect, a purple shadow rose in front of them all.

"The power of the Shadow! This is… the Punisher's ability." Norvic gasped.

"No… it's the King's ability." Ric corrected him.

Seeing who the Earl had gone up against, Quinn had immediately spread out his shadow towards the others, and had blocked the attack. There was no choice, otherwise all of them would have died.

[Shadow lock!]

A few seconds later, everyone found themselves in a dark space. One second they were in the swampy land, but now they were all together.

"What is this place?" Moe asked. "Is this also the King's doing?"

"It's part of my power." Quinn answered, after being the last one to appear.

In his hands he held the Earl and placed him on the ground. The others came rushing forward to help, and could see that there was a giant hole in his stomach where he had been hit.

"Was that from… His Majesty's doppelganger?" Moa gulped.

"Yes, the doppelgangers that have taken my form are too strong for all of you. It's too dangerous." Quinn pulled out a flask of blood and poured some into Ronston's mouth and directly on the wound as well.

At the same time, Quinn used the gauntlet to give him a bit of the energy he had absorbed from the doppelganger of himself he had fought earlier. He could always get this amount back through a few beasts. Seeing that the Earl was doing better, Quinn stood up and readied himself.

"What are you planning to do, Your Majesty? Use the shadow to help us get back?" Norvic asked, now being polite compared to before.

"No, you guys stay in here, I will get the Nest Crystal and will let you out when it is safe." Quinn answered.

"That's crazy!" Nian shouted. "You used your ability. I'm sure they sensed it, when you return there will be hundreds of those beasts waiting for you, and they probably will have all copied your strength. We know you're strong, but I doubt you could get through that."

Quinn looked at them all for a while.

"Thank you for your concern. You are good vampires, but I was the one that asked you to get this crystal. I won't let you guys lose your life over something that I asked for. Not when I can get it myself.

"Just tell me the general direction of the crystal." Quinn insisted.

Nian and Norvic tried their best to describe to him what the area of the nest crystal had looked like, but they had only been able to see it from a distance. They also didn't have as much trouble last time as they did this time. Perhaps because of them attempting to get the crystal already, it had caused it to be more on guard.

"Okay, everyone please look after the Earl for me. Jesk, make sure to get along with them as well. Don't worry, I won't be long. Maybe two minutes." Quinn stated.

Before they could question what he meant by that, he had already left the Shadow space. Landing in the strange sludge, he wasn't alone. Just as he had been warned, there were more than a hundred versions of himself.

"As much as I would love to try to fight you all, I have other things I need to do." Quinn said.

[Nitro accelerate activated]

Running through the crowd of himselves, none of them could keep up now that he had the active skill. At times there would be those that would appear and get in his way, but Quinn with his new speed and strength, not holding back on his Qi, was able to beat even himself in a single hit.

He hardly had to fight, as he got away from the initial lot as well, it seemed like the beasts couldn't form quick enough even for him. Finally, in the distance, Quinn could see the Nest Crystal, placed on a large leaf on a single mound of land.

Stepping on the soil with them all behind him, Quinn didn't hesitate as he grabbed the crystal.

[Nest Crystal has been obtained]

# Chapter 1504 - The Power Of A Nest Crystal
Inside the shadow space. Everyone was tapping their feet as they were wondering what was going on outside. They had been placed here, and the next second before they could even question what their King was doing, he was already gone.

"You think... he's still alive?" Joy asked.

"It's only been one minute, do you have that little faith in him?" Rick questioned her. "Besides, I think this space would collapse if he was dead."

"It's not a faith thing." Moe snapped back at Rick, who seemed to be quite boastful ever since Quinn had displayed his real strength. It was very annoying for the others. "You saw the damage Earl Ronston sustained from the attack of just one of those things. Since our King used his ability, it means there will be dozens more of them.

"The beast seems to even be able to copy the strength of him. It was a mistake to go after the Nest Crystal when it was protected by those doppelgangers. We should have just gone and searched after another one."

"First you complain that he's weak, and now you say he is too strong." Rick mumbled as he shook his head at the same time.

Not too far away from the group, it looked like someone was coming to. The Earl was slowly opening his eyes. He felt weak and tired even with the blood infusion, but he had recovered enough to get up. When opening his eyes, the first thing he could see was a set of large eyes staring right back at him, and white fur, lots of fur.

"What in the!" Ronsten shouted while quickly crawling backwards. It took him a moment to recognise the familiar looking gorilla who had been staring at him, and he began to notice the space that he was in.

"Looks like you're alive, old friend." Norvic cheerfully greeted the Earl. "His Majesty's beast companion seems to have taken an interest in you and has been protecting you."

"And you just left me in the care of a beast?" The Earl complained, but seemingly understanding the words, Jesk snorted in disdain, forcing the vampire lord to clear his throat in embarrassment. "You did a great job, allowing such a handsome beast to protect me. I'm sure it was following His Majesty's order. I shall praise your hard work, once he comes back."

Hearing these words, Jesk smiled widely and pounded himself on the chest.

"For now, all we can do is wait, but I really wonder what exactly this place is." Nian commented. "It looks endless, and I can't see anything else in here with us… but I'm not the only one that can sense 'that', right?"

The younger ones looked at each other strangely, but the other Viscount and Earl knew exactly what Nian was talking about. A dull energy, not quite a life but a strong one.

——

Outside, Quinn had obtained the Nest Crystal, which he now held in his hand. It was a fascinating object, and being as big as an ostrich egg it could barely fit in a single hand. Before he decided what to do with it, he needed to make sure he was safe first.

The first thing he attempted to do was either place it in his shadow space or his system, like other crystals he obtained. However, when trying to do so, it seemed with this particular crystal none of those options were exactly working.

Before retrieving the Nest Crystal, there were quite a few doppelgangers that had been following him, and more had appeared near the egg. Now, there was nothing and even the strange sludge that they were on, it had almost lost its colour and consistency as it was slowly turning back into a murky coloured water.

'Those strange beasts, they weren't really beasts in the first place. It must have all been from the power of this Nest Crystal.' Quinn thought. 'When Logan had obtained his Nest Crystal, the beasts didn't disappear but were just no longer interested in protecting it. This is a little different, though, those beasts seemed to come from that strange sludge itself and were powered by the Nest Crystal.'

Just holding it in his hand, he could feel a smidgen of how much power it held, he realised how it was able to do great things. How it was able to create unlimited clones and beasts. What he had, right now in his hand, was definitely something special. For a moment, he even wondered if it might be possible to weaponize its ability to summon doppelgangers to have them deal with the Dalki.

'Is it really impossible to turn one of these into a weapon?'

Seeing that the area was somewhat clear, Quinn was thinking about what to do. He wanted to absorb the crystal now into his system but was a little worried. When evolving his own body, sometimes he wasn't in the best of shapes or states.

He had no idea what a system upgrade would do. So with the little time he had left from his armour's ability before it went on cooldown, Quinn ran and ran until he eventually reached the ship, which was in perfect condition. Opening up his shadow space, all of those that were in it were now released onto the land.

The first thing they did was look around them, to see if there were any beasts. Seeing the ship, though, they knew where they were.

"You decided to head to the ship, after all. That was a wise decision, Your Majesty." Ronsten praised Quinn, unaware of the reality of the situation.

To this, Quinn just smiled, before showing the Earl the crystal in his hand.

"I managed to obtain what I came here for, so let's get out. I don't know what will happen once I use it, so I'll have to ask you all to please look after me." The Vampire King said.

[Would you like to absorb the next crystal and upgrade the system?]

He headed onto the ship, and the others were checking a few things before leaving. They all looked at each other, wondering just how he had done it. Quinn had entered the main part of the ship, and finally he was ready.

[Yes]

[Nest Crystal is now being absorbed into your body]

Immediately, Quinn felt a rush of energy course through his body, yet it wasn't a pleasant feeling at all. The energy was far too much for him to handle. It felt like someone was drowning his body in Qi. His veins felt like they were bursting.

It was so painful that Quinn could only let out a mighty scream. The other rushed into the ship once they heard it.

"What is going on, Your Majesty? Are you okay?" Ronsten asked.

"Don't touch me... " Quinn warned, veins bulging up his neck. "Just stay away. That's an order."

Hearing this, Jesk was making sure that everyone stayed back. Listening to his master's order, but the gorilla couldn't help and stared at the crystal behind him. Eventually, Jesk ran outside, trying to avoid doing something he didn't want to do.

The energy felt familiar yet not at the same time, and using what knowledge he had of Qi, Quinn was trying to get a hold on it, so it wouldn't so vigorously rampage through his body. Unfortunately, no matter what he tried to do, the pain didn't seem to be residing.

It was as if he had no other choice but to just accept the large amount of energy and let it run rampant through his body as it wished.

"Guys, I think we have a bigger problem. A wave of beasts has started heading our way!" Moe exclaimed, staring out the window. The next second and the whole ship shook.

"I will look after His Majesty and keep an eye on him, while you get rid of the beasts." Ronsten ordered.

Heading outside, the group got to work quickly. These were ordinary beasts, not like what they had fought outside, but there were many, and in the distance it looked like more were coming.

"Are they attracted to the Nest Crystal? What should we do?" Joy asked.

"Get rid of the beasts, and let's get out of here!" Nian ordered.

Moe, following orders, blood swipes his way through many of the beasts, and rushed around the back, but he could see that the thrusters to the ship had already been damged. With the ship incapable of flight, all they could do was communicate back to the others and ask for help.

In the meantime, they were stuck here, and they had an army of beasts to deal with.

"Defend His Majesty and the ship, until he is done with whatever he is doing!" Norvic ordered, as he slapped his big belly a couple of times. "That's all we have to do!"

Back in the ship, Quinn was thinking the same thing. He just had to get through this absorption stage, and then he would be able to deal with whatever was happening outside.

Sitting in the same state, Quinn had no idea how much time had passed, the pain was making him lose all of his senses. He was scared that it would never end, but at some point, a message had finally appeared in front of him.

[Update]

[Absorption of the nest crystal is now at 1%]

# Chapter 1505 - Another One Joins The List
The current rush of attack from the human and vampire alliance was in full swing against the Dalki. So far, nearly every planet and group were accomplishing their goals with ease without having encountered too much trouble. Unfortunately, the Dalki's defence force were nevertheless strong enough to have all factions suffer casualties.

At the moment, Sam and his group had just finished taking down the Dalki fortress in front of them. Dealing with the Dalki mothership itself was still a tricky business, but with users of the shadow and each group having one crystal, each one should be okay.

The only worry was that the group that entered had to be strong enough to either open up the ship from the inside to allow the others to come and join the fight, or to take down the system that would create the Dalki shield.

For his group, he would be relying on Layla who held the special storage crystal, along with Dennis who knew how to use the Shadow well and could also perform the Shadow travel. However, unlike Quinn's version he could only take a few people with him, since his space was small. This allowed him to take Vincent along with him, who was a strong leader in many senses.

Currently, Sam was standing in the destroyed fortress with the rest of the Cursed faction and vampires who were in on the attack. He was looking up at the mother ship that was a little away. The others had already gone inside, and they were just waiting for them to act.

"You look concerned." Logan commented, who was standing by his side. He wasn't fully involved in the fighting as much as the others, but then again, he and Sam were busy trying to see the bigger picture of the war and react to any sudden changes.

"I am." Sam admitted. "We've come far, but… everything has been going far too smoothly for my liking. I had planned for so many variables yet not one of them has occurred yet. It's as if they're just letting us retake our planets one by one."

"I would take that as a good thing. Our power has increased, and I think they know it." Logan replied. "So far the Dalki have always acted based on them being the stronger race, having the stronger forces that are able to overwhelm us. Maybe this time we have managed to overwhelm them."

It was then that Logan brought up something, a hologram of the solar system that seemed to somewhat back up what he was saying. There looked to be little counters by each of the planets out in the beast solar system.

"What is that?" Sam asked intrigued.

"Some time ago I went back to my parents' lab and used the knowledge gained from Richard to create something else. After creating the Demon tier beast finding system, I thought to myself if it's possible to find those beasts, why can't I create something that would help us get a read on the Dalki energy?

"The energy reading of a single spike Dalki shows as one. I have not enough data on a two spike or three spike Dalki, but they would certainly produce more energy than a one spike, giving out the reading of a higher number.

"I used my funds to create self-piloted ships that would drop off my devices on the planets. I'm sure it will be awhile till they find them, since the Dalki are too busy dealing with other things. Anyway, although we can't use this energy reading to give us an accurate number of how many Dalki are on a single planet, it will at least allow us to see where most of their forces are."

Looking at the numbers, they were all quite similar, as if equal forces had been placed on each of them. At the same time, many of the beast's planets were showing no signal at all.

"Are they planning to just defend?" Sam wondered. "It looks like they have set up defences on nine different planets, which is also equal to the number of attack groups we have. I was hoping your little energy radar would have picked up where Graham was.

"For now, all we can do is stick to the plan. The most important thing about this plan is to keep going forward. If one group gets left behind, we can't go back to help them, otherwise it will leave the Dalki with an opportunity." Sam explained, as he looked back towards one planet, that hadn't moved on from their position yet. The planet where Sach and Samantha were on.

Unexpectedly, while one group seemed to be moving slowly, there were two who were moving faster than any of the others. Blitzing their way through planet after planet, reclaiming what was once there's.

———

Rodeiro was a desert-like planet that had dark grey skies at all times throughout the day. Its gravity was around 1.5x stronger than that of Earth. Yet for Peter, who stood on top of a slanted rock looking outward towards the Dalki fortress that had been set up, this didn't seem to pose any problem.

He stood, walked and even ran as if everything was just fine, and the same was true for the vampires under his commands. Only the humans from the Cursed faction were still having a little difficulty adjusting to it.

"Don't worry, you guys rest for now!" Peter shouted as he looked back at his relatively large army of around 10,000 or so, but at the front were the vampires and one of the vampire leaders, Jake Muscat of the sixth family, along with his close family.

"He's going to do it again." Jake smiled, understanding the meaning of their commander's words. Peter had shared his strategy of how he was going to help them win, and initially Jake thought him to be slightly mad. The vampire forces numbered only in the hundreds.

The Dalki were strong, and they knew that, but he was sure he would see the same spectacle as he did before.

"Everyone, get ready to move onto the next planet, make preparations!" Peter shouted to the humans of the group, and they soon got to work.

It was then that Peter began to run through the crowd, and in doing so there were two others that were following him. A short while and Peter started to run across the plain hard desert and so did the others, but they were a cold distance away from Peter and the other two.

Readying his fist, Peter charged ahead, in front of his two Lesser Wights, and immediately punched down the large gate in the fortress. Shaking the whole place. The fortress had dented slightly as the chains had pulled back.

Seeing this, Peter punched it again and again, each time pushing the gate bit by bit. The Dalki, seeing this, had decided to stop him by jumping down the walls, but before they could even reach him, three of them got sliced in half, their bodies falling to the ground.

At the same time, on the other side, they had been struck right in the chest with a palm thrust and the two went flying back. They've been dealt with by a headless wight. This time it looked a bit different as it had body armour in its body as well.

Through more testing, Peter had learnt more about his Lesser Wights, and he didn't know if it was just something unique to him, but Hilston's body was still able to use the power of beast gear. His body was still as strong as it was before, and there was now this as well.

However, during his conquest, there was something else Peter had discovered and learnt. Throwing both of his fists back, a strange glow started to appear around them, and throwing them both at the same time, a stronger strike than before blasted the doors.

Swinging them off their hinges and hitting the Dalki that were standing just behind the door. Peter, who thought he would never learn such a thing, had learned some form of Qi. The only strange thing was, he could only coat Qi on his fists, and it was quite visible when he did so. It was a strange phenomenon, especially for someone who thought he had none, but Nate told him to just go along with it.

Yet there was one more trick up his sleeve, as Peter placed his hand on one of the Dalki that had been killed by the door.

"Wake up!" Peter shouted, and the body started to get up by itself. The two spiked Dalki that was by the ground Next, Peter placed his hand on another as well.

"Wake up!" And another Dalki rose, yet, the other two were still Lesser Wights belonging to Peter.

The Wight was now able to make more Lesser Wights than before, and had become a strong being that was able to match up to the previous Big four with his powers and strength.

With the large door down, the vampires came rushing in, as it was time for them to start their massacre.

——

The second group that was also making fast progress came as no surprise because this family was the Blade family, and they had just landed on the first Dalki owned beast planet.

"We need to be careful." Vorden cautioned those under his command, as he flapped his large wings on his back. "I have a feeling it won't be easy from now onwards."

# Chapter 1506 - Back From The Grave
The planet that Sam was most concerned about was struggling for a valid reason, because right now, they were dealing with one of the most feared Dalki for all mankind, one of their leaders, One Horn.

A few moments ago, Sach, Samantha, Fex, and Linda were frightened about what they're about to face off against. They were worried that they wouldn't be enough to go up against such a titan. However, just as their worries were starting to take over, a ship could be seen in the distance and crashing down from it were three figures that were there for support.

The headless knight, Oscar, Mona, and by her side a Dalki. With this support, the others were confident, and they were all waiting to see who would be making the first move.

"Haha, come on, I heard your name was One Horn, right? Well, after today you'll have to rename yourself No Horn!" Fex taunted the Dalki leader as he realised his threads were aimed straight for the crooked horn that was on the Dalki's head.

One Horn didn't regard them as a threat or anything he needed to worry about. He was ready to just break through the strings, but at the same time everyone else took that as their signal to make a move.

Mona had charged in with her Dalki heading in first, and Sach had run around the side and jumped in at the same time as the Dalki did, pincering One Horn.

"Should we move in as well?" Linda wondered.

"Not yet. All the five spike Dalki seem to have a special ability, and we still have no idea what his is. The best time to attack is when the opponent is trying to attack you!" Samantha shook her head, as she could see something happening soon.

Seeing the others move, One Horn ignored the string allowing it to be tied around his head, while at the same time he punched Sach's leg sending the Supreme Commander back through the snow, and punched the Dalki at the same time, able to plot his focus.

Sach got up quickly from the snow, his leg throbbing and stumbling a little.

'Damn, it hurts this much from a single hit, despite my blood aura and hardening ability. Thankfully, my leg isn't broken this time. There needs to be a way to hurt him!'

However, the other Dalki who had attacked at the same time and was a three spike, was not in a good condition at all. The right side of its body was missing as green blood dripped from his body. It looked like it was already on its last legs, and the only reason it had survived was because Fex had pulled it slightly to the side.

'What a waste.' Mona sighed, as she placed her hand on the Demon tier Amulet. Not long after, the Dalki had fallen to the floor, the energy being transferred over to herself.

She activated her beast equipment as well, knowing that they would soon be in for a brawl. Samantha, Fex, and Linda hadn't moved in after the pincer attack, they still felt like there was a chance for an opening, but One Horn's counter attack had been too fast for them to find one.

"We have to get close!" Linda said, as she inched towards One Horn, while Mona on the other side charged in fully.

"If you're in danger, I'll try to move you out of the way with my strings. From back here, I can see things a little clearer than you two." Fex suggested as he threw out his needles, piercing the two girls in the back.

Agent 11 was still back in camp, the vampire was aware that he would hardly be able to do much to the Dalki leader. As for his blood weapon, unfortunately there wasn't a good target to use it on.

When Mona charged in, she had done so quite confidently, feeling stronger than she had ever done before. At the same time, she was making sure she was breathing correctly. One Horn turned around, throwing out his leg behind to hit her, but she leaned back just in time avoiding the hit, and moved in quickly hitting him in the chest with a hook.

In retaliation, One Horn tried to chomp down on her, but by moving slightly and spinning to the side, she punched the Dalki leader twice in the side quickly. The blows didn't look like they had hurt him much, but each time she successfully hit One Horn loud bangs could be heard by everyone watching.

They all knew each strike had great power in them, and everyone was just amazed at how skilful Mona was. Right now, in a life and death situation, she was able to fight so calmly and skilfully.

"That is the power of the Big Four, alright." Sach smiled. "We have to wait for the right time."

The woman continued to avoid the strikes, but although One Horn was getting pummelled, he didn't seem to have lost a single drop of blood. Eventually, Mona made a slight mistake as she lost her footing in the snow, slipping slightly.

This was the opportunity One Horn had been waiting for and his large fist aimed towards her head. Mona barely managed to place both her hands over her head.

'Crap… I messed up… a five spike Dalki hit will kill me in one blow!'

Before the fist hit Mona, though, the others had taken action. Both Samantha and Linda appeared by her side. With all their strength they threw their fist towards One Horn's, and at the same time, in the air from above, with his knee forward hitting the fist as well, was Sach.

All of their strength striking at once it still felt like it wasn't enough, but the two powers colliding had bought Fex enough time to act as well. Piercing her with a needle, he pulled Mona out of danger.

The two girls could feel that the bones in their forearms had shattered, including those in their knuckles, but they still pushed forward, until they felt the strings pulling them away as well.

With only Sach left, One Horn's strength, although not at the power it was before, continued to push forth. It had sent the Supreme Commander flying through the air, once again crashing into the snow.

"You little ants are only delaying the inevitable!" One Horn stated coldly.

"Why did you guys do that?" Mona asked, now that she was out of harm's way.

She then saw that their arms and the bones in their body were healing, recalling that neither one of them was human any more.

"You don't have to worry about us so much." Samantha reassured her. "We know we are not strong like you. You're one of our best chances at beating him. So you keep attacking him, and whenever we can, we will protect you from getting hit."

At the same time, seeing that Mona really was their best shot and being the only human there, Fex had a suggestion as he pulled out the black needle from his body.

"This should give you a bit of a power boost. Don't worry, I won't try to control you. You're a better fighter than me, so I won't interfere."

Quickly recovering, Sach stood up, his knees now shaking.

"Hahaha, you call us ants, but we sure are giving you a hard time." Sach proclaimed.

His ability as well as his new vampire body was giving him great strength, and he was putting up a much better fight compared to the previous time.

"What else should I call you?" One Horn questioned, stomping his foot. "Look at me! Despite all of you teaming up in your feeble attempt of bringing me down, you have yet to injure me to any meaningful degree. Tell me, how do you think you can kill me?"

Sach just smiled back at this face.

"You're right… we might be unable to… that's why we're counting on him."

Sharp bones rose from the ground, piercing through the hard scale of One Horn, going right through his legs. Turning his head, looking behind him, he stared at the armoured being who hadn't even moved yet.

Then, when looking at the dead Dalki, it no longer had a head on its body. Walking forward, there was a bone sword in Oscar's hand.

"ArghhH!" One Horn shouted, moving forward, and breaking the bones that had pierced him. Part of them were still in his leg, but turning around he was now looking at who had done this to him, and he could see a familiar looking head shoved right in front of his eyes with a strange smile.

"What?! How's that possible? Didn't I kill you already?" One Horn shouted in confusion, before he even realised that his body was unable to move.

*****

# Chapter 1507 - Crushed Like An Ant
The others had seen the Dullahan use his strange power to freeze his opponents once before, when his head made eye contact with one it wished to slay. The only thing was, the others hadn't expected that such a thing could work against the Dalki, especially the five spiked Dalki leader.

Yet they were all witnessing it right now. The muscles on One horn's body were tensing in an attempt to move. His calf was expanding and bulging yet nothing was working.

"What kind of freakish monster are you?!" One Horn shouted at the top of his lungs.

A bone from the ground rose, and held onto the head making a hand at the end to grab it, just like it had done the time before. At the same time, gripping onto the bone sword tightly with both hands, it looked like Oscar was ready.

He swung it out towards One Horn's neck. It was a clean hit and at first the sword looked to be going through until it suddenly stopped.

The veins on One Horn's neck were showing even through his thick black scales. Green blood could be seen rising up in that area. No matter how much Oscar tried to push the sword through, it wasn't budging, despite his great strength.

"Let me give you a hand!" Mona shouted, as she came rushing forward. The woman jumped, kicking the back of the sword with her legs. This time, Mona had the black needle in her back, and power was surging through her body. She had the power of the amulet, her beast gear and now a blood weapon.

A loud bang was heard, and it pushed a sword around an inch further. More green blood started trickling down One Horn's neck.

"I see now." One Horn stated as he grabbed onto the Bone sword itself, and snapped it with his large fingers. He quickly pulled out the shard of sword that was stuck in his neck and hurled it towards Oscar's head that was still being held up by the bone.

Before it reached it though, Oscar had jumped in the way anticipating the move, and the shard had gone right through his armour. It had stopped when hitting his flesh, but there was no blood dripping from his body.

"I see you really are a monster." One Horn added as he closed his eyes and moved his head slightly, looking away from the head.

'That's not good. It appears as if he figured out that it only works on eye contact. Oscar's trick won't work again, and that might have been our only chance just now. However, if we hurt him once… we can do it again.' Mona thought, pushing off her two legs and going towards One Horn like a rocket. She bashed into his back, pushing him slightly.

At the same time, Oscar had retrieved his head, which was now by his side, forming a brand-new bone sword in his hand. From the ground rising through the snow, several weapons appeared in the area.

They were spear, axes, giant swords and small ones, but each one of them looked to have been created from bones. One Horn attempted to hit Mona who was behind him with a back fist, yet it missed and hit nothing but the air.

Despite her boost she wasn't faster than the Dalki leader, just able to predict his moves when needed. It was tiring and wasn't a hundred percent perfect, and with an enemy like him, a single miscalculation could be the end of her.

However, seeing One Horn's strength, letting him live might spell the end of the human race. He wasn't feared as humanity's bane after the first war for nothing. Oscar barged into One Horn, with the side of his shoulder, and tried to knock the Dalki down who quickly took a swing for his chest.

The sword had been grabbed, and split apart once again, for One Horn to deliver a great punch to Oscar's head. It knocked off the helmet he wore, that went flying and landed far off into the snow.

Now, where Oscar's helmet once was, a strange smoke could be seen appearing at the top of it. Grabbing another sword from the ground that he had created. Oscar swung a bone axe, hitting One Horn in the ribs, chucking him back a few steps.

Blood was drawn again, but none of the blows were deep enough to be fatal.

"You ants are starting to seriously piss me off!" One Horn shouted as he punched his two fists together. He then started to claw at his chest, creating two more large scratch marks, allowing his body to bleed more, giving him a boost in power.

When the axe had hit One's Horn's body it had broken, but picking up a spear this time, Oscar hurled it towards the Dalki. Seeing this, he hesitated slightly, before charging forward. Spinning his body, he avoided the spear and grabbed it.

The next second, the Dalki had it back towards his opponent. Mid-air, jumping towards it, was Mona, who attempted to grab onto the handle. It seemed like it did nothing as it took her along with the momentum…

A few moments later though, Sach, Linda and Samantha were all standing behind ready to catch her as her body hit theirs.

It looked like One Horn was going towards them, but before it could even reach them, Oscar was there and this time he held up his head in front of him. It stopped One Horn's charge, slowing it down, causing the Dalki to close its eyes.

At that moment, a giant hammer made of bones was swung down, hitting the top of its head. It crashed in the snow and against the ground creating a large creator underneath and even shook the Shelter they were away from.

Oscar was proving in this fight that his strength was no less than the five spike.

"When we all fought One Horn last time… no matter what we used, he was able to overwhelm us…" Samantha couldn't help but utter as she saw her father figure contend with his quasi murderer.

"Everything's changed." Sach explained. "None of us are human, for one. Before, a single punch from him would have knocked me out of this fight. This time I've already taken a couple and I can still keep going. This time there're more of us as well. Your father is a lot stronger!"

The second the bone hammer had crashed on top of One Horn's head, it broke, but seconds later Oscar picked up another one. The new weapon also smashed down on the Dalki leader, again with enough force to shake the ground.

The crater got deeper underneath the two of them. Another hammer was formed, and it was thrown down again, making it even deeper and large cracks began to appear. Snow was falling through the fissures that had been created.

Not stopping again, a large hammer was created, and it was thrown onto One Horn's head directly again, only this time, a hand was lifted above it, grabbing the weapon before it could reach its target. He pushed back against it, and soon another hand appeared to help the first one. Something was strange, though.

Grabbing on the large Hammer, all of One Horn's fingers could be seen, it was almost as if his hand had gotten…bigger.

Standing up from the ground, the hammer was grabbed by both hands, and by the second they realised that they weren't just imagining things. One Horn was indeed growing in size. Blood spilled out of his mouth, but his size was getting bigger by the second. He was already a large two metre tall Dalki, yet he seemed to be growing even bigger.

"This has to be it!" Samantha exclaimed. "The special trait we were warned about. Dad, get out of there!!" Samantha screamed at the top of her lungs.

Now, looking at One Horn, he was ten metres in height and was a colossal giant. Large Dalki wings sprouted from his back, and a tail started to grow as well. It wasn't special like Slicers but right now they were looking at a giant five spike Dalki, whose head could even tip over the Shelter walls.

"Holy crap, it's like what happened on those TV shows!" Fex exclaimed. "Power blamers! Wait, why doesn't that sound right?"

Looking down, One Horn could see Oscar below him, smaller than his foot. He smiled, before lifting it up, and slamming it down on him.

"This time, I'll make sure you stay dead, ant!"

*****

# Chapter 1508 - Giant Dalki
The large foot slammed into the ground and chucked up the snow and pieces of the ground with it. It was clear that not only had One Horn's size changed, but his strength had drastically increased as well.

Most of the others stumbled as the strike was unexpected and as they lifted themselves out of the snow, Samantha looked towards the snow and could see One Horn's smile.

"NOOOOO!" Samantha screamed and squinted her eyes. "I…I…"

She was scared that she had lost her father once more. It was a pain that had taken a long time to heal, and Samantha wasn't even sure if she was actually over it. Seeing Oscar appear in his new form, how he had been with her, she had felt like a piece of her had slowly been coming back.

Samantha still felt guilty about the choice she had made at that time, but she couldn't deny that she enjoyed spending time with Oscar, even the way he was now…

Closing her eyes, there was a striking pain in her heart. Suddenly, they heard a loud neigh going off in the distance. Looking up, she could see that Oscar was now on top of his familiar. The large black horse spewed green mist out from its nostrils.

"He's…"

"Still alive." Mona finished the sentence, giving Samantha a hand and bringing her back up to her feet. "But that one needs to be killed."

It didn't take a genius to figure out which one Mona was talking about. The Dalki leader that even those inside the shelter could now see. Seeing the large head made those patrolling the walls shake in fear.

The battle was taking place around two hundred metres away, but those from the Earthborn group were frozen still.

"If that Dalki were to jump from there to here….it would destroy the shelter in a couple of hits." One of them uttered on the wall.

Fortunately, it seemed that One Horn was far more concerned with the surrounding 'ants'. Seeing Oscar still alive, he thought he must have been imagining things. Lifting his foot up, there was only a large imprint on the ground with a few crushed bones from the weapons, yet no body.

Which meant that the figure on top of the Horse was indeed the one he had been fighting so far. Angry, One Horn attempted to swat the horse away, yet the familiar jumped over the large hand, moving at a speed that surpassed even most vampire leaders.

Its feet hardly touched the ground as it looked more like it was gliding. However, the power behind One Horn's attack was so powerful that it created a wind force that managed to uproot the trees some distance away.

'How…how do we kill something like that?' Fex gulped down hard, as he looked up at the Dalki. He took back his black needle, he imagined Mona just had been getting tired of her blood being drained, and now instead he had placed it in himself. The Royal Knight immediately felt the surge of power, and he started to twindle his fingers making his red string go over each other again and again.

"What are you planning?" Sach asked as he approached his side.

"It's going to take a while, but I believe I can create a string thick enough to at least hold him in place… Honestly, I have no way of trying to kill him. I can only tie him up and make him trip or something, and he might even still break out." Fex replied. "Still, keeping him in place, might help the rest of you to somehow deal with him."

The others were thinking hard as well, but could think of nothing. Seeing Fex like he was, they all felt like they couldn't just sit back without at least trying to help out.

In the meantime, while the others were thinking. Oscar was taking action, he had brought out a bone whip. Galloping on top of his familiar, he had tried to wrap it around One's Horn's large leg quickly. Pulling on it, the bones pierced his hard scales and green blood painted the snow.

Unfortunately, it seemed to do nothing, as One Horn simply lifted his foot and stomped down again. The bone whip broke, yet they still weren't getting closer to a solution.

Instead, it looked like One Horn was going to act. He pulled back both of his hands, and shortly after threw them down at the ground one after another. Unlike the stomps with his foot, these blows weren't slow by any means.

Each fist hit the ground, creating large craters along with a piece of land to be thrown up. It felt like the whole planet was shaking with each hit. Eventually, one of the strikes even caused a pool of water to form in the crater.

The others tried to get out of the range of the attack, as One Horn seemed to be solely focused on Oscar. The Dullahan was constantly moving and still avoiding the strikes by One Horn, but then the Horse did something different. When avoiding one of the strikes, it looked to have galloped on the air itself.

Hitting the air, it created a cloud of green smoke from its hoof. It continued to move upward as if hitting a solid hall this way. The horse was somehow flying, without actually flying. Now getting close, it made One Horn's position slightly awkward. In Oscar's hand he had formed quite the large bone spear, but something strange happened, and it was as if the Bone itself had stopped forming before the spear could be finished.

Once again, Oscar could no longer rely on his bone powers. Somewhat similar to how ability users would run out of MC cells. Still, he threw the unfinished spear as hard as he could towards One Horn. Bending down slightly, One Horn allowed it to hit his forehead just to the side of where his Horn would be.

It had pierced its head but stopped short. Still, it looked like it had hurt him more than he had anticipated, as he flapped his wings in anger.

"Stop delaying the inevitable!" One Horn screamed in frustration.

Seeing this, the horse started to neigh in response constantly. Like it was scared or trying to say something. Back on the ground, watching everything and not being able to interfere, Fex's earring started to glow, and a few seconds later the little bull Ham appeared.

"Master, master, I have an urgent thing to tell you. It's the Horse King who wants to ask you all of a favour!" Ham urgently said. "He says, to keep the big monster occupied. Give him some time, and he'll be able to defeat it. Find a way to hold it still!"

Listening to these words, the others looked at each other. It was the only hope they had. Now, covering their faces from the heavy dust of winds, they could see that One Horn was following the familiar into the air.

The horse quickly turned away and started to run through the air, leaving clouds of green smoke behind, yet the Dalki leader Horn followed.

"NO!" Sach shouted out. "That's… they're heading towards the Shelter!!!"

The others quickly started running after, but were far too slow to keep up with the likes of One Horn and the Horse King, even for a group of super beings.

A short while later, still on their way, the whole ground shook countless times. They could only imagine what was happening, and when they got closer they could see what was happening as well. The sound of screams were heard throughout, but it was being drowned out by rumbling and explosions of power.

Eventually the group had arrived, but it was not the same place they had come from.

The walls had been destroyed, dead bodies lay in the snow on the ground, too many to count. It looked as if not a single person had survived. In the middle of the entire shelter. Walking through the walls, none of the structures were what they used to be, and it was hard to imagine that a single person, out of their army of fifty thousand-ish had survived the onslaught.

In the centre though, there were two beings, One Horn was no longer flying, and Oscar was there as well.

'Why…why did he come to the Shelter? He should have known everyone was here?' Sach thought.

Listening to this, and the fact that the Horse had run in this direction and what was ordered of them. She had some ideas, but she didn't want to say it. She didn't want to say what she thought in case it wasn't true.

"Come on, Sach, you're our Supreme Commander! We need to kill One Horn, once and for all! We can't allow the sacrifice of everyone here to have been for nothing! Pick yourself up, and let's do the job that we came here to do!!"

# Chapter 1509 - A Cruel Power
Mona's pep talk had snapped the rest out of their daze as they realised the real threat that was in front of them, but what could they do? Just how were they meant to hold One Horn down and make him stay still!

The Horse once again started neighing, and Fex, not having put Ham away, nodded as he began to relay the information to the others.

"He's going to start the process now, so you all need to do something. Just keep him in the general area, and make sure he can't fly." Ham translated.

"I think I can do something," Fex answered. "I kept rethreading my string powers over and over. Honestly, I'm pretty exhausted, but I think this is the strongest string I have ever made in my life."

While running, Fex had never stopped making string, even during the attack. He had it wrapped around his arm; it looked like he was carrying multiple thick scarves as the other end of it hung and touched the surface.

"To stop him moving, the two main things we need to wrap are his wings and legs, but…I don't know how we're going to do that." Fex said, holding onto the string and pulling it a couple of times for good measure.

"I have a plan." Mona smiled while staring at One Horn.

——

A few moments later, everyone was moving into action, heading towards One Horn. Seeing this, it looked like Oscar was putting faith in his colleagues. For one, he jumped off the Horse and landed on the ground.

He jumped backwards a few times using his powerful legs. He jumped like a grasshopper towards the Shelter and quickly got away from One Horn. Then placing his head on the ground, he was ready to take action, placing both his hands on the floor.

He was vulnerable right now, and if One Horn hit him with a single hit, he would be done for. Regardless, he could see a group springing into action.

The others were already in front of One Horn before the latter could even react. First, the Horse began to glide in the air, and he quickly charged towards One Horn and headed towards its head.

Seeing this, One Horn opened its large mouth and just chomped down on the Horse. The second he did, the Horse turned into green smoke and spread everywhere in the surroundings.

"What is this… there's no blood!" One Horn was surprised and a little dizzy as the green smoke had some kind of woozy effect on him.

"This is great; the familiar is helping us out..but with it just having died, it looks like it will no longer be able to help Oscar avoid those blows. This is going to be our only chance." Fex shouted as he had a fraction of the string in his hand compared to moments ago and was getting ready to do his job.

Being somewhat blind and in a daze, One Horn was swinging rapidly, and someone chose to take this opportunity as she leapt upon One Horn's arm. As he swung widely, Mona had to be careful and have a firm grasp of her balance. While he was swinging his arms trying to hit something, she had to hold on to some scales. Then when it stopped, she ran up the arm as fast as she could.

It felt like Mona was playing some kind of game. At the same time, in her hand, she held a spear. Mona had got this from one of the dimensional storage boxes she had around her waist. Rarely did she use weapons since her fists were always her choice, but once in a while, they would come in handy depending on what type of beast she would face.

Today seemed like their day. Tied around one of the spears was part of the string Fex had created. She hoped for her plan to work somewhat, but it would be tough.

Finally, running up, she was on top of One Horn's shoulder. He still seemed to be affected by the smoke, and now that she was also closer to the gas, she also was feeling its effects. Still, she quickly held her breath to not let it affect her anymore.

Mona looked at the weakest part of the wing where the scales weren't as strong. She thought there was a chance. She wasn't exactly weak, so she hoped this would work. Hurling the spear towards the wing, the spear pierced through, but it was like a dot on One Horn's wing. Anyway, it wasn't exactly meant to hurt him.

'One down, one more to go…I just hope the others will be okay. I don't know who has the hardest job out of this.'

It was then that One Horn acted and suddenly began to flap his large wings again. It seemed like he was going to take off. Perhaps return later when he was feeling better after healing, but the group had to hold him down at any cost no matter what.

And at this moment, Linda and Samantha came forward. They were the best option right now because of their strength, and their bodies also grew in size as shadows wrapped around them.

Seconds later, the two had grown significantly in size and had armour around their bodies. Linda had kept both of their armour sets in her dimensional space for a moment like this.

Linda ran to the closest leg of One Horn while Samantha ran towards the other one. It didn't take long for Samantha to evolve and get stronger with Linda as her teacher. At the same time, Linda, having been turned earlier by Quinn, was far stronger than she had realised.

The two of them grabbed onto One Horn's legs and began to pull him down. Their height came just up to his knees. Even though the two girls could be considered giants right now, they looked dwarf compared to One Horn.

"What is this?!" One Horn grumbled. He felt like his wings' coordination was quite off as they weren't moving in sync with each other. This was because Mona was also busy doing her work, and so were the two boys.

Mona tried to get One Horn's wings in a twist using her weapons and the string. At the same time, on the ground below, the boys swiftly ran around him, trying to tie up the legs, especially around the knees, to avoid the girls getting tangled up in the whole thing.

"It's working; our plan is working!" Fex thought as he continued to run around fast and was creating more red string just in case. He felt as if he was about to faint as if real blood was leaving his fingertips instead of the blooded strings.

Still, they weren't going to give up. It was only because of everyone's effort that they could keep One Horn down, and they felt like if any of them made a mistake, One Horn would escape.

"Please, Oscar... finish him," Sach muttered to himself.

While the others were busy holding One Horn, Oscar had been doing something that the others perhaps never wanted to see. As he put his palms on the ground, flesh began to fade from all the dead bodies around him. Soon, only their bones remained of everyone from the Shelter who had died.

This process was slow and took a while to complete, so he needed the others to distract One Horn. Now for the next step, their bones sank to the ground as well. They weren't just sinking. The energy from their bones was going to Oscar.

From this, something gigantic was forming around Oscar's body. The bones encased around him, and soon it was nearly impossible to see the original Oscar. The bones clad around his head and continued to grow in size, and eventually, he matched even One Horn in size.

It looked like a giant skull warrior was formed, and it had a single, huge double-handed bone sword. Inside somewhere around the chest area, was Oscar controlling such a creature.

"I think…this might be enough to finish the job." Fex smiled.
