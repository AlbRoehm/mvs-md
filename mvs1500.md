Chapter 1500 - This Is Our King?
It took a few hours for them to finally reach the planet, and honestly Quinn was quite pleased by the fact for more reasons than one. He had felt really uncomfortable around all the vampires. Whenever he would walk past, they would give him glares here and there.

At the same time, others would get out of his way or leave the room when he entered. Not that Quinn was the talkative type or anything, but it was clear they were treating him differently, and the thing was he knew it wasn't because they were being rude, it was the opposite.

"I guess that's what it's like to be King? I'm happy that everyone on the Cursed faction treats me well, and surprisingly, I'm happy that he's here as well." Quinn said, looking up at Jesk.

The ship was landing, and Quinn was waiting to get off by the back of the ship where the ramp would descend. By his side was Jesk, who felt like the only person he could talk to.

'Wait, I just realised, have I just been replacing the voices in my head with Jesk?' Quinn started to think back to how everyone was treating him on the ship. Quinn had often talked to the gorilla when he had troubles, but the gorilla had done and would only grunt at times.

"I think I am going crazy with all these past voices in my head, huh, Jesk?" Quinn asked out loud, looking at the gorilla again. He wasn't even aware how this comment made him look to the other vampires, starting to worry about him.

Getting off the ship, Quinn could see that the world's air here wasn't exactly pleasant. Everything seemed to be covered in a slight green smog, and the planet smelt like wet mud. It was then that Quinn noticed that the ship had landed on what looked like one of the few pieces of land.

When staring out far, he could hardly see any land anywhere, and even his feet were now sinking slightly into the soft mud. That was because almost the entire planet was similar to a large swamp. It was covered in water, but it looked even dirtier than the ones on Earth and ts the water looked to be made of a thicker substance.

"Sorry that we couldn't bring you closer." Ronsten apologised, seeing the look on Quinn's face. "As you know, the beasts are far more frequent near the Nest Crystal, and we can't risk them damaging the ship.

"We had initially set up the teleporter and tried to retrieve the crystal, but since it proved too difficult, we retreated. Upon returning, the teleporter had been destroyed. If we had more people, we might have left some to guard the teleporter, but given our force splitting them seemed like a bad idea."

"I understand." Quinn cut them off. "I'm guessing the ship can't go through the water too well either."

The Vampire King watched everyone get into action. Viscount Norvic led a group of four vampire, whereas Viscount Nian led a group of five, while the Earl stayed quite close to Quinn. It seemed like he was taking his duty quite seriously to protect the King.

Although they had split into two groups, they weren't far away. It was just how they had been trained to fight, covering each other's back and so on.

When Quinn stepped into the swamp area, the water came just below his knees, and the substance he could tell was quite thick. It slowed down his movements in his legs ever so slightly, although Jesk was dealing with it with relative ease.

He even offered to let Quinn ride on his back, but he had refused as he wanted to get used to the strange water.

"Ah crap, do we really have to do this again!" Moe complained as he stared left and right. There were quite a lot of swamp trees in the area that would have vines in them. Sometimes there were few vines allowing them to see quite far off into the land, while others there were too many trees with the vines making it hard for them to see anything.

"Come on, is it really that scary fighting against yourself? Besides this time I'm going to beat her!" Joy cheerfully proclaimed, pumping her fist. The other vampires following from behind found it quite cute.

The next second though, they could see the vines moving apart, and what looked like a mix between a frog and a giant hippo swimming through. Its body was large, but its face had puffed out its cheeks.

"Beasts, prepare for attack!" Norvic shouted out.

Quinn had been warned beforehand that the closer they came to the crystal, the more beasts they would encounter, so he was sure that this wouldn't be the only one.

"Your Majesty, let us deal with this, so you can save your strength for the-'' Before Ronsten could finish his sentence a tongue wrapped around his face while he was distracted. Using his hands though, he was able to rip it off, but there were plenty of beasts, and it looked like no one had time to be worrying about the other.

Soon, another frog had tried to latch its tongue towards Quinn, but before it reached his head, Jesk had thrown one of its arm out to intercept the tongue, causing it to wrap around its forearm. With another hands it held onto the tongue and pulled it forward causing the creature's fat body to fly in the air and the next second it hammered it down with its fist punching it and causing water to gush up.

"I will be fine, focus on yourself." Quinn advised, as he began to observe everyone around him. He wanted to see their strength for more reasons than one. Right now, they were just guiding him to the place, but if they couldn't hold their own, then perhaps it would be safer for Quinn to place them in his Shadow space and just leave them be for now.

The beasts were at the Emperor tier level, but there were a lot of them. Seeing how everyone seemed to be doing fine on their own, Quinn wanted to test something, and he soon sprinted towards two of the hippo frogs that were in front of him.

Although they had large bodies, somehow they could sink into the ground even though it wasn't so deep, and when doing so, he could tell that they moved quite fast. Some of the others weren't really paying attention to their own fight, instead having chosen to watch their King's action.

The frogs began their attack, popping up like moles from the water and would shoot out their tongues. Here Quinn would avoid them, but only just. He was doing this constantly, not getting hit once.

Then after some time had passed he ran up to one of the beasts, it opened its mouth wide and attempted to bite Quinn. Despite their bulky size, the beast was quick, and its jaw had chomped down, biting the vampire's arm.

He had his gauntlet on, and it was unable to pierce it, even with its strong jaws.

'Now that I know your strength, let's test a few things.' Quinn thought to himself, placing his other gauntlet on the frog. Then he started to absorb the energy.

After that, Quinn went to the other frog that was attacking him and gave it the energy he had just collected, just like he had done with Jesk when he had fought the grey gorilla. He then allowed himself to be hit by the tongue.

The others watching this were surprised. They had no clue what Quinn was doing. He was still testing the limits of his gauntlet and just how much power he could give them, and take away. What effect it would have in the end.

He intended to test out the capabilities of his improved equipment, but for those watching, they could just see someone getting hit by low level beasts, unable to comprehend his action.

"Was it really borrowed power?" Moe asked out loud.

"No, he hasn't used any of his blood powers, this must be some sort of training!" Rick argued back, while slashing the face off another frog.

"Yeah, but he still sucks!" Joy shouted, as she dodged another frog.

Eventually all the beasts had been defeated and in the end, for some reason, Jesk had been the one who had killed the two frogs Quinn had been fighting.

This was because after his little test, Quinn had given the leftover energy to Jesk since he no longer needed it. He was curious to find out if he could help his new friend evolve once again, by continuously feeding him energy. Of course, he would keep in mind not to overdo it, he himself knew better than anyone what an imbalance of power could do to one's body.

To the others, though, they were starting to think the rumours were really true. Even the Viscounts and the Earl were concerned. Continuing their travels, Quinn noticed that this time not only was the Earl by his side, but so were the two Viscounts.

"I have a question to ask, can the doppelgangers copy abilities?" Quinn wondered, unaware of what was happening.

The surrounding area had become clear, almost void of trees. They were just walking in the strange sludge when a plop was heard. A very loud plop.

The water itself rose, and it looked like it was forming into something. Straight away, Ronsten stood in front of Quinn, and a few seconds later a copy of him appeared in front of him, blocking their path.

"I guess I'm about to find out." Quinn smiled.

*****

Chapter 1501 - Progressive Beasts
There was something about this planet which was different to the other beast planets that Quinn had been to in the past and the beasts that he had encountered. For one, the strange sludge that he was in was making it difficult for him to use his ears to dictate where the beasts were coming from.

At the same time, when he tried to use his Qi to sense energy it was as if there was a constant energy running through the sludge itself, but it wasn't enough for Quinn to bother using his gauntlet on either. Now of all things, the dangerous beast that they all were afraid of, and that he had been warned about, had suddenly appeared in front of them.

Out from the strange water, its body had formed in seconds, creating an identical copy of Ronsten. What shocked Quinn even more was that it was impossible to tell the difference between the two. It was an identical copy down to the last hair strand, and somehow they were even able to emulate the smell that the vampires emitted.

[Inspect]

[Progressive beast discovered]

[Your system has made a new discovery!]

[10,000 exp points received]

'Progressive beast? I've never heard of such a thing before. What does that even mean?' Quinn wondered. The system was breaking down the knowledge that Quinn had obtained in school, the knowledge they had been taught in their military academy.

At the end of the day, Quinn realised that these beast planets in this solar system aren't exactly the same as the ones in the beast solar system. At the same time, beast planets were a new discovery, and just like the crystals, beasts themselves seemed to be things they were learning more about every day.

The system didn't seem like it was able to answer Quinn's questions, and he had suddenly turned to his gorilla friend, as if he was going to ask it a question like he would do Ray or Vincent, but he knew there would be no such luck as he slapped his forehead.

'What am I thinking?'

When what was about to occur, Quinn was wondering why the others hadn't stepped forward yet, and had decided to stay a few feet back. For now, he decided to do the same as he watched carefully.

Ronsten decided to strike at the doppelganger, aming for its throat. It was a deathly blow aimed to kill it in one strike, but it was soon blocked, and the doppelganger had done the same in return.

Blocking the sma attack, Ronsten this time grabbed it by the wrist and threw the other over its shoulder only to perfectly land in the water unharmed. The two continued a high speed battle, just mainly using their fists. No blood attacks or abilities seemed to be used, and both of them were even in battle.

'So the beast can match up to the Earl's strength, and speed. Otherwise, it wouldn't be able to stop the attacks, but why isn't he using any abilities?'

Watching carefully, it looked like the two Viscounts were getting ready to make a move, then at the same time they charged in.

"Now!" The Earl shouted as he jumped back and both of them went for the strike. They pierced the doppelganger's chest, and now Ronsten went forward, striking its throat once more and killing it this time.

There was no blood from its wounds, but it looked like a fatal blow would make the doppelganger look like it was melting as it fell into the water. Ronsten looked a bit panicked as he went back to the others.

"From here on out, we have to tread carefully, Your Majesty." Ronsten explained. "We have found no way to tell where the doppelgangers appear from, and we were very lucky that this time there was only a single one. As we move through the swamp, more will appear. As you can see, fighting one of my own was difficult enough if I was to come face to face with two or three of me…"

Now Quinn understood why everyone was a little cautious to move forward. It was in case they had entered the nest area. Logan had explained to Quinn that there was a radius the beasts seemed to operate in, when protecting the nest.

They wouldn't move out from this area, and it looked like they had just crossed the borderline. Stepping in could have summoned more.

"But why didn't you use your ability, is it for the same reason?" Quinn asked.

"Not quite. Unfortunately, using Blood energy or abilities seems to attract those buggers to us." Norvic answered. "Last time, they suddenly surrounded us. They can't copy our abilities, but the second we use them, more and more start to appear.

"We were lucky to have managed to get out alive."

There was another thing that Quinn noticed after the beast had been defeated, it had dropped no crystal. Quinn pondered if those things might actually be something similar to how the Demon tier Tree has used the Marked.

Still, if Quinn could grab onto one of these progressive beasts, then maybe a copy of him would have a large amount of energy he could steal from it. The excitement was growing in Quinn already.

Worst case, he believed his gauntlet might be the perfect weapon against this type of enemy. He could just share his energy with the others to make it, so they could beat their counterparts. As long as the beast's energy didn't increase as well, of course.

"We don't know why, but as long as we don't use our abilities, at most a clone is created for each of us who enters." Nian explained. "When we got close, a clone was created of each of us, and we believe the same thing will occur again. It was only after we used our abilities more arrived. So past this point we should avoid using our abilities and try to work together during our own fights to help each other.

"The Earl is one of the strongest so he might need the most help, but we will try to swap opponents midway before the beast can notice and adapt and kill each other's counterparts."

Looking at the others, Quinn noticed that none of them were wearing beast gear either. Although the beast were able to match their strength and speed for some reason, the Vampire King couldn't imagine that they would be able to copy the abilities of beast gear as well. It only reassured him in his belief that he would be able to beat his own counterpart.

Yet, for some reason, he felt like if he were to use any of these things, he would be cheating himself.

The group walked forward, and now the groups were making a little more sense to Quinn. He imagined that many of them had been practising each other's fighting styles, so they could kill the other clones rather than themselves.

'That's a problem… if my copy really will be as strong as me, even if it will just be my base stats… I doubt anyone here could beat it.' Quinn thought. At the same time, the Earl was staying close to him because he had a similar yet different thought.

'I don't know how strong His Majesty's clone will be, but if he were to fight mine, he could be in for some trouble. We will have to try to finish him off first and the others later if we are to stand a chance of winning this.'

It wasn't long until the sound of several loud drops was heard again, more than one this time. From the water, more doppelgangers were emerging. Just like what had been explained, a copy of each person had been created, there was even a version of the giant gorilla standing opposite Jesk.

The fighting between all of them had begun, yet a clone hadn't appeared in front of Quinn for some reason. Ronsten, noticing this, had no choice but to abort his plan and try to face him for a while for the time being.

'Huh, I was actually looking forward to fighting myself?' Quinn sighed. 'I wonder what happened? Am I too strong for them to copy?'

While watching the others fight, Quinn was ready to initiate his plan until he noticed something. He hadn't really been paying attention, but due to how close the doppelgangers looked between one another… Quinn had no idea which one was the real or fake one.

[Inspect]

'What…my inspect skill, it's bringing up the same person for both of them now…' Realising this, Quinn also realised using this shadow lock wouldn't help in this situation either, because he didn't know which one was the fake…

Finally, in front of Quinn, he could see himself merging out of the water, and a smile appeared in front of the clone's face. The next second, a fist was thrown out so fast, hitting him right in the stomach.

He was sent through the air and fell back crashing into the water.

"What the hell!" Moe shouted, noticing who had just flown by. "Is he that weak that he can't even beat himself?"

Ironically, it was quite the opposite, the clone was strong… just as strong as their King.

*****

Chapter 1502 - Quinn Vs Quinn
Just like last time, everyone seemed to be having a tough time against their counterpart. Although their plan was to help out each other by switching opponents for a short time, it was almost like their enemies were prepared for this and made it impossible to find an opening. At times they would even move so they could block their way. Not only were their movesets the same but so were their thoughts. Making them worry that their plan might not work out as they intended.

Meanwhile, Jesk and his doppelganger didn't rely on any particular strategy, instead opting to use brute strength. Their fight wasn't too different from the gorilla having fought the grey member of his species back on the Vampire Planet, only that he and his counterpart had three pairs of hands each. Unable to overwhelm the other, they had entered a dogfight, exchanging their fists and at this rate, both the beasts would end up falling eventually.

Quinn, who had been whacked away from where the others had been fighting, quickly got up from the ground, only to find his own doppelganger rushing towards him.

'Well, at least now I won't have to worry about it going for any of the others.' Quinn thought, as he readied himself to do combat. The first thing the doppelganger did, now that it had reached the Vampire King, was a thigh kick. Seeing this, Quinn was in the middle of deciding what to do. Whether he should block it or not, but his natural reaction in seeing this was to send out a kick himself.

Both of the legs clashed, shin on shin, hitting each other and sending out a shockwave of strength. The sludge that they were standing in had created a small wave that was being sent outward.

'Damn, the first hit he got on me was because I was distracted but that kick just now proves it. He didn't just copy my base stats, but seems to have copied my strength with the best gear on!' Quinn shockingly realised, as he continued to attack his doppelganger counterpart.

Quinn wasn't holding back when using his speed or strength, though he wasn't using his Qi energy either. He was afraid that this might attract the other beasts towards their location. Their group was having a tough time dealing with one doppelganger each, no need to add to their numbers.

At the moment, he hadn't seen the Nest crystal yet, and until he did. He doesn't want to risk attracting them all.

'Besides… let's see if there is a way I can beat myself.' Quinn decided.

With his palm in a claw-like shape, Quinn was attempting to grab the beast and absorb the energy. He wanted to test his theory to see if the beast also had the same energy as himself. When he threw out his hand, though, the Quinn in front of him had disappeared with a flash step.

The next second, the doppelganger reappeared behind him. Quinn quickly turned around and whacked the fists of the opponent away, attempting to kick him in the stomach, but this move was avoided as well. It was going to be a tough fight.

——

Meanwhile, a little away from where Quinn was, the others were struggling, but they needed to initiate their plan soon.

"Damn this ugly bastard!" Moe cursed.

"Have you never taken a look in a mirror, that's exactly what you look like in real life!" Joy shouted back as she backflipped, avoiding a punch, and charged right in, throwing a fury of punches herself. Her doppelganger did the same, and their fists were colliding with each other head on.

"Don't we have to try to see if His Majesty is okay? The fog has gotten thick around here, and it's hard to see. I'm a little worried." Rick voiced his concerns to the others. Unlike the others, he wasn't attacking so much and just avoiding the blow until the order was given.

"The King will have to help himself, if we break formation we'll all die!" Norvic shouted in frustration. A few moments later, Earl Ronston finally gave the signal.

"Switch!" Norvic shouted. It was time to put the plan into action.

———

Quinn had been fighting his doppelganger only for a short while but during that time he had tried out a number of different things to get the advantage, his Muay Baron skills, the vampire fighting skills, and even the military training he had received.

Unfortunately, it looked like the doppelganger knew everything that he did, meaning that they clashed without a real winner. The fight felt like it could go on forever, and it didn't look like Quinn could outsmart the beast.

"I really wanted to play and try to find some way to beat you fairly, but I'm afraid the others really need my help." Quinn sighed, as he charged in once again. However, this time he aimed for the body, the largest part of Doppelganger Quinn.

When attacking, he didn't slow down, ignoring the possible retaliation. The doppelganger aimed at the same region as the Vampire King. It was at that moment that two powerful blows struck their stomachs at the same time.

'So this is what it feels like to take a punch from myself.' Quinn grunted with a bit of blood trickling from his mouth, but the doppelganger was clearly hurt as well. Smiling, Quinn threw another punch holding on, and they were both hit once again.

'Alright, let's back it up a little.' Quinn thought as he stepped back and pulled the flask out from his side. Of all things, he had never imagined that this would come in handy now of all times.

If Blood skills attracted attention, Quinn was worried about the blood armour as well, but he knew the flask that had nothing but blood in it wouldn't be the same, and there was one thing that the doppelganger looked like it couldn't do and that was heal.

'Alright, time to finish this.' Quinn thought.

——

Following the command, just like they had practised, each one of them broke off, and went to attack the doppelganger of another vampire. The two Viscounts were going to help the Earl quickly, helping him face the toughest opponent. Meanwhile, the group went on the defensive but switched opponents.

"Haha, I'm so happy I got to smash your ugly face in!" Joy shouted as she continued to punch Moe, again and again.

Each of the group had revealed their weaknesses to each other. Maybe they couldn't beat themselves in a fight, but their plan seemed to be working. Of course, with the Viscounts gone they were struggling and unable to deal with them but defending and just holding on was a different story.

In the end, the two Viscounts along with the Earl were able to deal with his doppelganger once again, and quickly rushed back to help out the rest. Now outnumbering the beasts, they were easily able to get rid of the rest of the doppelgangers including the one Jesk had been fighting to a standstill.

Finally, the group had defeated all the beasts, and they just needed a moment to catch their breath. Some of them were hurt but not nearly as bad as the previous time.

"Is everyone okay, where is his Majesty?" Ronsten asked.

They all nodded and looked off in the direction Quinn had flown off to. The fog behind them had gotten thick that they were unable to see. Walking through the mist, though, eventually they could see Quinn walking through and waving at them all. He had a little blood on his armour, but mostly looked uninjured.

"He must have gotten lucky if he managed to take care of his beast." Moe commented.

Meeting up with the others, Quinn was happy to see that their plan worked, but he was wondering how they should progress next. In the middle of this thought, a sound was heard.

*Plop *Plop *Plop

Each of them looked at each other in horror, for it sounded like they were about to go for another round against the doppelgangers.

"It's okay!" Nian shouted. "We went against them once, we can do it again. We have a plan now!"

A metre away, the beasts started to form in front of them, but this time something was different. As they began to take shape, a lot of them noticed that it no longer looked like them. Instead, they all had taken the form of Earl Ronsten.

"What is this?" Joy asked, her hands shaking in fear. "This didn't happen before."

"They must have taken the form of the strongest one of us? Were they just playing games before? If we all have to fight the Earl, none of us will win against him."

*BANG*

A loud slapping sound was heard, as if something had smacked into water. When tilting their heads to see what had just happened, they could see the King, Quinn, standing in front of a headless Earl.

"This is much easier than fighting myself." Quinn announced with a large grin.

The others couldn't believe it, but Rick had seen it. He had been watching the King, and so had the Earl. It was a single punch. Faster than the Ronston would be able to move or react, and based on the strength, it had the power to kill him in one hit.


"Remind me which one of you said the king was weak again? I think we're about to see a massacre." Rick smiled.

*****

Chapter 1503 - Invincible Army
Even though the others hadn't seen what Quinn had done, the fact that there was now one less doppelganger of the Earl in front of them, they had no choice but to believe it was their King's doing. At the same time, they had their own fights to worry about.

The doppelgangers immediately started to strike at the person in front of them. Those that were less skilful, all they could do was block while making sure to protect their more vulnerable places.

They were getting hurt, and if they didn't do something soon, they would be in serious trouble. Some were getting desperate and thinking of attacking, but before they could the Viscount gave them words of encouragement.

"Just keep defending for now!" Norvic shouted. "We will find a way to deal with them!"

It was at that moment, the Viscount splitting his attention off of the Ronston doppelganger, that his opponent had hit him in the stomach. It was a powerful hit that nearly made him kneel to the ground, but tensing his stomach at the last moment, he somewhat managed to lighten the blow.

"I guess having a large belly isn't always a bad thing." Norvic commented, as he grabbed the Earl's wrist and twisted the skin together, trying to rip it apart. Although it did some damage in retaliation, it looked like the doppelganger of the Earl was ready to strike the Viscount's head.

'If I don't use my abilities…then I'll be dead. We have to use it and refocus.'

"Not just yet." A voice warned as it grabbed the hand of the doppelganger. Looking at whom it was, Norvic could see that it was His Majesty. Quinn was holding onto it tightly, and it wasn't budging an inch, either.

With its other hand, it looked like the doppelganger was attempting to hit him again, but it moved ever so slightly before Quinn grabbed hold of that one as well.

"Go on, I'm letting you punch this one. It hit you, so give it your best shot." Quinn said. The doppelganger tried to struggle free, but with one kick his legs were broken. The bodies that they transformed into, although lacking any blood, still behaved like the bodies they copied.

Not wasting time and wanting to help the others, Norvic was more than happy to deliver a finishing blow, striking the Earl in the head with both his fists.

"You help your group, whileI'll go help Nian." Quinn ordered. Heading over that way, Norvic couldn't help but think about what he had just seen, and he smiled to himself.

'I was an idiot. I wonder who even spread those rumours in the first place. The King being weak… if that had been true, how would the other leaders have accepted him? I doubt any of it had been borrowed power…he is just that strong.'

Quinn had landed in the middle of the vampires and Viscount Nian, who had formed a circle. This way they couldn't get attacked from behind. Jumping again, he positioned himself in the middle of the circle in between both sides.

He soon left again, jumping the vampires and kicked two of the viscounts head's. The strength of a single attack of his was able to finish them off.

Seeing this, the others could finally catch a break and could just see Quinn smiling back at them. They had fought the doppelgangers. They knew that it could replicate their strength, and they had faced the Earl's hits that were anything but weak.

They doubted even the leaders without using their abilities could deal with an Earl so easily. Then suddenly, the real Earl himself was hurled across the water. Like a thrown stone, he skipped on the top of it several times, crashing and causing waves to rise up.

It forced many of them to turn and look at what was happening, and they noticed that their own doppelgangers had stopped their advance as well.

'The Earl shouldn't be able to do that to himself, I can smell blood as well. I have a feeling that we might just have a serious problem on our hands.' Quinn thought.

Looking at where Ronston had come from, the Vampire King saw what looked like a replica of himself. It had taken a while for Quinn to get a doppelganger to face him, but this just made Quinn worry even more.

The other doppelgangers had stopped advancing because, once again, they were all changing forms… this time into Quinn. Each of them had a slight smirk on their face as only one side of their mouths would lift slightly.

"Moe… I'm a little scared." Joy admitted, as she looked at His Majesty in front of her.

Norvic, seeing those under him frightened, didn't know what to do. Now that he knew the King wasn't weak at all and after seeing what had happened to Earl Ronston, the strongest vampire after Quinn, he was afraid they would all be doomed. At the same time, it looked like every single one of them were ready to strike.

They threw their fists fast towards each one, but before their fists could connect, a purple shadow rose in front of them all.

"The power of the Shadow! This is… the Punisher's ability." Norvic gasped.

"No… it's the King's ability." Ric corrected him.

Seeing who the Earl had gone up against, Quinn had immediately spread out his shadow towards the others, and had blocked the attack. There was no choice, otherwise all of them would have died.

[Shadow lock!]

A few seconds later, everyone found themselves in a dark space. One second they were in the swampy land, but now they were all together.

"What is this place?" Moe asked. "Is this also the King's doing?"

"It's part of my power." Quinn answered, after being the last one to appear.

In his hands he held the Earl and placed him on the ground. The others came rushing forward to help, and could see that there was a giant hole in his stomach where he had been hit.

"Was that from… His Majesty's doppelganger?" Moa gulped.

"Yes, the doppelgangers that have taken my form are too strong for all of you. It's too dangerous." Quinn pulled out a flask of blood and poured some into Ronston's mouth and directly on the wound as well.

At the same time, Quinn used the gauntlet to give him a bit of the energy he had absorbed from the doppelganger of himself he had fought earlier. He could always get this amount back through a few beasts. Seeing that the Earl was doing better, Quinn stood up and readied himself.

"What are you planning to do, Your Majesty? Use the shadow to help us get back?" Norvic asked, now being polite compared to before.

"No, you guys stay in here, I will get the Nest Crystal and will let you out when it is safe." Quinn answered.

"That's crazy!" Nian shouted. "You used your ability. I'm sure they sensed it, when you return there will be hundreds of those beasts waiting for you, and they probably will have all copied your strength. We know you're strong, but I doubt you could get through that."

Quinn looked at them all for a while.

"Thank you for your concern. You are good vampires, but I was the one that asked you to get this crystal. I won't let you guys lose your life over something that I asked for. Not when I can get it myself.

"Just tell me the general direction of the crystal." Quinn insisted.

Nian and Norvic tried their best to describe to him what the area of the nest crystal had looked like, but they had only been able to see it from a distance. They also didn't have as much trouble last time as they did this time. Perhaps because of them attempting to get the crystal already, it had caused it to be more on guard.

"Okay, everyone please look after the Earl for me. Jesk, make sure to get along with them as well. Don't worry, I won't be long. Maybe two minutes." Quinn stated.

Before they could question what he meant by that, he had already left the Shadow space. Landing in the strange sludge, he wasn't alone. Just as he had been warned, there were more than a hundred versions of himself.

"As much as I would love to try to fight you all, I have other things I need to do." Quinn said.

[Nitro accelerate activated]

Running through the crowd of himselves, none of them could keep up now that he had the active skill. At times there would be those that would appear and get in his way, but Quinn with his new speed and strength, not holding back on his Qi, was able to beat even himself in a single hit.

He hardly had to fight, as he got away from the initial lot as well, it seemed like the beasts couldn't form quick enough even for him. Finally, in the distance, Quinn could see the Nest Crystal, placed on a large leaf on a single mound of land.

Stepping on the soil with them all behind him, Quinn didn't hesitate as he grabbed the crystal.

[Nest Crystal has been obtained]

Chapter 1504 - The Power Of A Nest Crystal
Inside the shadow space. Everyone was tapping their feet as they were wondering what was going on outside. They had been placed here, and the next second before they could even question what their King was doing, he was already gone.

"You think... he's still alive?" Joy asked.

"It's only been one minute, do you have that little faith in him?" Rick questioned her. "Besides, I think this space would collapse if he was dead."

"It's not a faith thing." Moe snapped back at Rick, who seemed to be quite boastful ever since Quinn had displayed his real strength. It was very annoying for the others. "You saw the damage Earl Ronston sustained from the attack of just one of those things. Since our King used his ability, it means there will be dozens more of them.

"The beast seems to even be able to copy the strength of him. It was a mistake to go after the Nest Crystal when it was protected by those doppelgangers. We should have just gone and searched after another one."

"First you complain that he's weak, and now you say he is too strong." Rick mumbled as he shook his head at the same time.

Not too far away from the group, it looked like someone was coming to. The Earl was slowly opening his eyes. He felt weak and tired even with the blood infusion, but he had recovered enough to get up. When opening his eyes, the first thing he could see was a set of large eyes staring right back at him, and white fur, lots of fur.

"What in the!" Ronsten shouted while quickly crawling backwards. It took him a moment to recognise the familiar looking gorilla who had been staring at him, and he began to notice the space that he was in.

"Looks like you're alive, old friend." Norvic cheerfully greeted the Earl. "His Majesty's beast companion seems to have taken an interest in you and has been protecting you."

"And you just left me in the care of a beast?" The Earl complained, but seemingly understanding the words, Jesk snorted in disdain, forcing the vampire lord to clear his throat in embarrassment. "You did a great job, allowing such a handsome beast to protect me. I'm sure it was following His Majesty's order. I shall praise your hard work, once he comes back."

Hearing these words, Jesk smiled widely and pounded himself on the chest.

"For now, all we can do is wait, but I really wonder what exactly this place is." Nian commented. "It looks endless, and I can't see anything else in here with us… but I'm not the only one that can sense 'that', right?"

The younger ones looked at each other strangely, but the other Viscount and Earl knew exactly what Nian was talking about. A dull energy, not quite a life but a strong one.

——

Outside, Quinn had obtained the Nest Crystal, which he now held in his hand. It was a fascinating object, and being as big as an ostrich egg it could barely fit in a single hand. Before he decided what to do with it, he needed to make sure he was safe first.

The first thing he attempted to do was either place it in his shadow space or his system, like other crystals he obtained. However, when trying to do so, it seemed with this particular crystal none of those options were exactly working.

Before retrieving the Nest Crystal, there were quite a few doppelgangers that had been following him, and more had appeared near the egg. Now, there was nothing and even the strange sludge that they were on, it had almost lost its colour and consistency as it was slowly turning back into a murky coloured water.

'Those strange beasts, they weren't really beasts in the first place. It must have all been from the power of this Nest Crystal.' Quinn thought. 'When Logan had obtained his Nest Crystal, the beasts didn't disappear but were just no longer interested in protecting it. This is a little different, though, those beasts seemed to come from that strange sludge itself and were powered by the Nest Crystal.'

Just holding it in his hand, he could feel a smidgen of how much power it held, he realised how it was able to do great things. How it was able to create unlimited clones and beasts. What he had, right now in his hand, was definitely something special. For a moment, he even wondered if it might be possible to weaponize its ability to summon doppelgangers to have them deal with the Dalki.

'Is it really impossible to turn one of these into a weapon?'

Seeing that the area was somewhat clear, Quinn was thinking about what to do. He wanted to absorb the crystal now into his system but was a little worried. When evolving his own body, sometimes he wasn't in the best of shapes or states.

He had no idea what a system upgrade would do. So with the little time he had left from his armour's ability before it went on cooldown, Quinn ran and ran until he eventually reached the ship, which was in perfect condition. Opening up his shadow space, all of those that were in it were now released onto the land.

The first thing they did was look around them, to see if there were any beasts. Seeing the ship, though, they knew where they were.

"You decided to head to the ship, after all. That was a wise decision, Your Majesty." Ronsten praised Quinn, unaware of the reality of the situation.

To this, Quinn just smiled, before showing the Earl the crystal in his hand.

"I managed to obtain what I came here for, so let's get out. I don't know what will happen once I use it, so I'll have to ask you all to please look after me." The Vampire King said.

[Would you like to absorb the next crystal and upgrade the system?]

He headed onto the ship, and the others were checking a few things before leaving. They all looked at each other, wondering just how he had done it. Quinn had entered the main part of the ship, and finally he was ready.

[Yes]

[Nest Crystal is now being absorbed into your body]

Immediately, Quinn felt a rush of energy course through his body, yet it wasn't a pleasant feeling at all. The energy was far too much for him to handle. It felt like someone was drowning his body in Qi. His veins felt like they were bursting.

It was so painful that Quinn could only let out a mighty scream. The other rushed into the ship once they heard it.

"What is going on, Your Majesty? Are you okay?" Ronsten asked.

"Don't touch me... " Quinn warned, veins bulging up his neck. "Just stay away. That's an order."

Hearing this, Jesk was making sure that everyone stayed back. Listening to his master's order, but the gorilla couldn't help and stared at the crystal behind him. Eventually, Jesk ran outside, trying to avoid doing something he didn't want to do.

The energy felt familiar yet not at the same time, and using what knowledge he had of Qi, Quinn was trying to get a hold on it, so it wouldn't so vigorously rampage through his body. Unfortunately, no matter what he tried to do, the pain didn't seem to be residing.

It was as if he had no other choice but to just accept the large amount of energy and let it run rampant through his body as it wished.

"Guys, I think we have a bigger problem. A wave of beasts has started heading our way!" Moe exclaimed, staring out the window. The next second and the whole ship shook.

"I will look after His Majesty and keep an eye on him, while you get rid of the beasts." Ronsten ordered.

Heading outside, the group got to work quickly. These were ordinary beasts, not like what they had fought outside, but there were many, and in the distance it looked like more were coming.

"Are they attracted to the Nest Crystal? What should we do?" Joy asked.

"Get rid of the beasts, and let's get out of here!" Nian ordered.

Moe, following orders, blood swipes his way through many of the beasts, and rushed around the back, but he could see that the thrusters to the ship had already been damged. With the ship incapable of flight, all they could do was communicate back to the others and ask for help.

In the meantime, they were stuck here, and they had an army of beasts to deal with.

"Defend His Majesty and the ship, until he is done with whatever he is doing!" Norvic ordered, as he slapped his big belly a couple of times. "That's all we have to do!"

Back in the ship, Quinn was thinking the same thing. He just had to get through this absorption stage, and then he would be able to deal with whatever was happening outside.

Sitting in the same state, Quinn had no idea how much time had passed, the pain was making him lose all of his senses. He was scared that it would never end, but at some point, a message had finally appeared in front of him.

[Update]

[Absorption of the nest crystal is now at 1%]

Chapter 1505 - Another One Joins The List
The current rush of attack from the human and vampire alliance was in full swing against the Dalki. So far, nearly every planet and group were accomplishing their goals with ease without having encountered too much trouble. Unfortunately, the Dalki's defence force were nevertheless strong enough to have all factions suffer casualties.

At the moment, Sam and his group had just finished taking down the Dalki fortress in front of them. Dealing with the Dalki mothership itself was still a tricky business, but with users of the shadow and each group having one crystal, each one should be okay.

The only worry was that the group that entered had to be strong enough to either open up the ship from the inside to allow the others to come and join the fight, or to take down the system that would create the Dalki shield.

For his group, he would be relying on Layla who held the special storage crystal, along with Dennis who knew how to use the Shadow well and could also perform the Shadow travel. However, unlike Quinn's version he could only take a few people with him, since his space was small. This allowed him to take Vincent along with him, who was a strong leader in many senses.

Currently, Sam was standing in the destroyed fortress with the rest of the Cursed faction and vampires who were in on the attack. He was looking up at the mother ship that was a little away. The others had already gone inside, and they were just waiting for them to act.

"You look concerned." Logan commented, who was standing by his side. He wasn't fully involved in the fighting as much as the others, but then again, he and Sam were busy trying to see the bigger picture of the war and react to any sudden changes.

"I am." Sam admitted. "We've come far, but… everything has been going far too smoothly for my liking. I had planned for so many variables yet not one of them has occurred yet. It's as if they're just letting us retake our planets one by one."

"I would take that as a good thing. Our power has increased, and I think they know it." Logan replied. "So far the Dalki have always acted based on them being the stronger race, having the stronger forces that are able to overwhelm us. Maybe this time we have managed to overwhelm them."

It was then that Logan brought up something, a hologram of the solar system that seemed to somewhat back up what he was saying. There looked to be little counters by each of the planets out in the beast solar system.

"What is that?" Sam asked intrigued.

"Some time ago I went back to my parents' lab and used the knowledge gained from Richard to create something else. After creating the Demon tier beast finding system, I thought to myself if it's possible to find those beasts, why can't I create something that would help us get a read on the Dalki energy?

"The energy reading of a single spike Dalki shows as one. I have not enough data on a two spike or three spike Dalki, but they would certainly produce more energy than a one spike, giving out the reading of a higher number.

"I used my funds to create self-piloted ships that would drop off my devices on the planets. I'm sure it will be awhile till they find them, since the Dalki are too busy dealing with other things. Anyway, although we can't use this energy reading to give us an accurate number of how many Dalki are on a single planet, it will at least allow us to see where most of their forces are."

Looking at the numbers, they were all quite similar, as if equal forces had been placed on each of them. At the same time, many of the beast's planets were showing no signal at all.

"Are they planning to just defend?" Sam wondered. "It looks like they have set up defences on nine different planets, which is also equal to the number of attack groups we have. I was hoping your little energy radar would have picked up where Graham was.

"For now, all we can do is stick to the plan. The most important thing about this plan is to keep going forward. If one group gets left behind, we can't go back to help them, otherwise it will leave the Dalki with an opportunity." Sam explained, as he looked back towards one planet, that hadn't moved on from their position yet. The planet where Sach and Samantha were on.

Unexpectedly, while one group seemed to be moving slowly, there were two who were moving faster than any of the others. Blitzing their way through planet after planet, reclaiming what was once there's.

———

Rodeiro was a desert-like planet that had dark grey skies at all times throughout the day. Its gravity was around 1.5x stronger than that of Earth. Yet for Peter, who stood on top of a slanted rock looking outward towards the Dalki fortress that had been set up, this didn't seem to pose any problem.

He stood, walked and even ran as if everything was just fine, and the same was true for the vampires under his commands. Only the humans from the Cursed faction were still having a little difficulty adjusting to it.

"Don't worry, you guys rest for now!" Peter shouted as he looked back at his relatively large army of around 10,000 or so, but at the front were the vampires and one of the vampire leaders, Jake Muscat of the sixth family, along with his close family.

"He's going to do it again." Jake smiled, understanding the meaning of their commander's words. Peter had shared his strategy of how he was going to help them win, and initially Jake thought him to be slightly mad. The vampire forces numbered only in the hundreds.

The Dalki were strong, and they knew that, but he was sure he would see the same spectacle as he did before.

"Everyone, get ready to move onto the next planet, make preparations!" Peter shouted to the humans of the group, and they soon got to work.

It was then that Peter began to run through the crowd, and in doing so there were two others that were following him. A short while and Peter started to run across the plain hard desert and so did the others, but they were a cold distance away from Peter and the other two.

Readying his fist, Peter charged ahead, in front of his two Lesser Wights, and immediately punched down the large gate in the fortress. Shaking the whole place. The fortress had dented slightly as the chains had pulled back.

Seeing this, Peter punched it again and again, each time pushing the gate bit by bit. The Dalki, seeing this, had decided to stop him by jumping down the walls, but before they could even reach him, three of them got sliced in half, their bodies falling to the ground.

At the same time, on the other side, they had been struck right in the chest with a palm thrust and the two went flying back. They've been dealt with by a headless wight. This time it looked a bit different as it had body armour in its body as well.

Through more testing, Peter had learnt more about his Lesser Wights, and he didn't know if it was just something unique to him, but Hilston's body was still able to use the power of beast gear. His body was still as strong as it was before, and there was now this as well.

However, during his conquest, there was something else Peter had discovered and learnt. Throwing both of his fists back, a strange glow started to appear around them, and throwing them both at the same time, a stronger strike than before blasted the doors.

Swinging them off their hinges and hitting the Dalki that were standing just behind the door. Peter, who thought he would never learn such a thing, had learned some form of Qi. The only strange thing was, he could only coat Qi on his fists, and it was quite visible when he did so. It was a strange phenomenon, especially for someone who thought he had none, but Nate told him to just go along with it.

Yet there was one more trick up his sleeve, as Peter placed his hand on one of the Dalki that had been killed by the door.

"Wake up!" Peter shouted, and the body started to get up by itself. The two spiked Dalki that was by the ground Next, Peter placed his hand on another as well.

"Wake up!" And another Dalki rose, yet, the other two were still Lesser Wights belonging to Peter.

The Wight was now able to make more Lesser Wights than before, and had become a strong being that was able to match up to the previous Big four with his powers and strength.

With the large door down, the vampires came rushing in, as it was time for them to start their massacre.

——

The second group that was also making fast progress came as no surprise because this family was the Blade family, and they had just landed on the first Dalki owned beast planet.

"We need to be careful." Vorden cautioned those under his command, as he flapped his large wings on his back. "I have a feeling it won't be easy from now onwards."

*****

Chapter 1506 - Back From The Grave
The planet that Sam was most concerned about was struggling for a valid reason, because right now, they were dealing with one of the most feared Dalki for all mankind, one of their leaders, One Horn.

A few moments ago, Sach, Samantha, Fex, and Linda were frightened about what they're about to face off against. They were worried that they wouldn't be enough to go up against such a titan. However, just as their worries were starting to take over, a ship could be seen in the distance and crashing down from it were three figures that were there for support.

The headless knight, Oscar, Mona, and by her side a Dalki. With this support, the others were confident, and they were all waiting to see who would be making the first move.

"Haha, come on, I heard your name was One Horn, right? Well, after today you'll have to rename yourself No Horn!" Fex taunted the Dalki leader as he realised his threads were aimed straight for the crooked horn that was on the Dalki's head.

One Horn didn't regard them as a threat or anything he needed to worry about. He was ready to just break through the strings, but at the same time everyone else took that as their signal to make a move.

Mona had charged in with her Dalki heading in first, and Sach had run around the side and jumped in at the same time as the Dalki did, pincering One Horn.

"Should we move in as well?" Linda wondered.

"Not yet. All the five spike Dalki seem to have a special ability, and we still have no idea what his is. The best time to attack is when the opponent is trying to attack you!" Samantha shook her head, as she could see something happening soon.

Seeing the others move, One Horn ignored the string allowing it to be tied around his head, while at the same time he punched Sach's leg sending the Supreme Commander back through the snow, and punched the Dalki at the same time, able to plot his focus.

Sach got up quickly from the snow, his leg throbbing and stumbling a little.

'Damn, it hurts this much from a single hit, despite my blood aura and hardening ability. Thankfully, my leg isn't broken this time. There needs to be a way to hurt him!'

However, the other Dalki who had attacked at the same time and was a three spike, was not in a good condition at all. The right side of its body was missing as green blood dripped from his body. It looked like it was already on its last legs, and the only reason it had survived was because Fex had pulled it slightly to the side.

'What a waste.' Mona sighed, as she placed her hand on the Demon tier Amulet. Not long after, the Dalki had fallen to the floor, the energy being transferred over to herself.

She activated her beast equipment as well, knowing that they would soon be in for a brawl. Samantha, Fex, and Linda hadn't moved in after the pincer attack, they still felt like there was a chance for an opening, but One Horn's counter attack had been too fast for them to find one.

"We have to get close!" Linda said, as she inched towards One Horn, while Mona on the other side charged in fully.

"If you're in danger, I'll try to move you out of the way with my strings. From back here, I can see things a little clearer than you two." Fex suggested as he threw out his needles, piercing the two girls in the back.

Agent 11 was still back in camp, the vampire was aware that he would hardly be able to do much to the Dalki leader. As for his blood weapon, unfortunately there wasn't a good target to use it on.

When Mona charged in, she had done so quite confidently, feeling stronger than she had ever done before. At the same time, she was making sure she was breathing correctly. One Horn turned around, throwing out his leg behind to hit her, but she leaned back just in time avoiding the hit, and moved in quickly hitting him in the chest with a hook.

In retaliation, One Horn tried to chomp down on her, but by moving slightly and spinning to the side, she punched the Dalki leader twice in the side quickly. The blows didn't look like they had hurt him much, but each time she successfully hit One Horn loud bangs could be heard by everyone watching.

They all knew each strike had great power in them, and everyone was just amazed at how skilful Mona was. Right now, in a life and death situation, she was able to fight so calmly and skilfully.

"That is the power of the Big Four, alright." Sach smiled. "We have to wait for the right time."

The woman continued to avoid the strikes, but although One Horn was getting pummelled, he didn't seem to have lost a single drop of blood. Eventually, Mona made a slight mistake as she lost her footing in the snow, slipping slightly.

This was the opportunity One Horn had been waiting for and his large fist aimed towards her head. Mona barely managed to place both her hands over her head.

'Crap… I messed up… a five spike Dalki hit will kill me in one blow!'

Before the fist hit Mona, though, the others had taken action. Both Samantha and Linda appeared by her side. With all their strength they threw their fist towards One Horn's, and at the same time, in the air from above, with his knee forward hitting the fist as well, was Sach.

All of their strength striking at once it still felt like it wasn't enough, but the two powers colliding had bought Fex enough time to act as well. Piercing her with a needle, he pulled Mona out of danger.

The two girls could feel that the bones in their forearms had shattered, including those in their knuckles, but they still pushed forward, until they felt the strings pulling them away as well.

With only Sach left, One Horn's strength, although not at the power it was before, continued to push forth. It had sent the Supreme Commander flying through the air, once again crashing into the snow.

"You little ants are only delaying the inevitable!" One Horn stated coldly.

"Why did you guys do that?" Mona asked, now that she was out of harm's way.

She then saw that their arms and the bones in their body were healing, recalling that neither one of them was human any more.

"You don't have to worry about us so much." Samantha reassured her. "We know we are not strong like you. You're one of our best chances at beating him. So you keep attacking him, and whenever we can, we will protect you from getting hit."

At the same time, seeing that Mona really was their best shot and being the only human there, Fex had a suggestion as he pulled out the black needle from his body.

"This should give you a bit of a power boost. Don't worry, I won't try to control you. You're a better fighter than me, so I won't interfere."

Quickly recovering, Sach stood up, his knees now shaking.

"Hahaha, you call us ants, but we sure are giving you a hard time." Sach proclaimed.

His ability as well as his new vampire body was giving him great strength, and he was putting up a much better fight compared to the previous time.

"What else should I call you?" One Horn questioned, stomping his foot. "Look at me! Despite all of you teaming up in your feeble attempt of bringing me down, you have yet to injure me to any meaningful degree. Tell me, how do you think you can kill me?"

Sach just smiled back at this face.

"You're right… we might be unable to… that's why we're counting on him."

Sharp bones rose from the ground, piercing through the hard scale of One Horn, going right through his legs. Turning his head, looking behind him, he stared at the armoured being who hadn't even moved yet.

Then, when looking at the dead Dalki, it no longer had a head on its body. Walking forward, there was a bone sword in Oscar's hand.

"ArghhH!" One Horn shouted, moving forward, and breaking the bones that had pierced him. Part of them were still in his leg, but turning around he was now looking at who had done this to him, and he could see a familiar looking head shoved right in front of his eyes with a strange smile.

"What?! How's that possible? Didn't I kill you already?" One Horn shouted in confusion, before he even realised that his body was unable to move.

*****

Chapter 1507 - Crushed Like An Ant
The others had seen the Dullahan use his strange power to freeze his opponents once before, when his head made eye contact with one it wished to slay. The only thing was, the others hadn't expected that such a thing could work against the Dalki, especially the five spiked Dalki leader.

Yet they were all witnessing it right now. The muscles on One horn's body were tensing in an attempt to move. His calf was expanding and bulging yet nothing was working.

"What kind of freakish monster are you?!" One Horn shouted at the top of his lungs.

A bone from the ground rose, and held onto the head making a hand at the end to grab it, just like it had done the time before. At the same time, gripping onto the bone sword tightly with both hands, it looked like Oscar was ready.

He swung it out towards One Horn's neck. It was a clean hit and at first the sword looked to be going through until it suddenly stopped.

The veins on One Horn's neck were showing even through his thick black scales. Green blood could be seen rising up in that area. No matter how much Oscar tried to push the sword through, it wasn't budging, despite his great strength.

"Let me give you a hand!" Mona shouted, as she came rushing forward. The woman jumped, kicking the back of the sword with her legs. This time, Mona had the black needle in her back, and power was surging through her body. She had the power of the amulet, her beast gear and now a blood weapon.

A loud bang was heard, and it pushed a sword around an inch further. More green blood started trickling down One Horn's neck.

"I see now." One Horn stated as he grabbed onto the Bone sword itself, and snapped it with his large fingers. He quickly pulled out the shard of sword that was stuck in his neck and hurled it towards Oscar's head that was still being held up by the bone.

Before it reached it though, Oscar had jumped in the way anticipating the move, and the shard had gone right through his armour. It had stopped when hitting his flesh, but there was no blood dripping from his body.

"I see you really are a monster." One Horn added as he closed his eyes and moved his head slightly, looking away from the head.

'That's not good. It appears as if he figured out that it only works on eye contact. Oscar's trick won't work again, and that might have been our only chance just now. However, if we hurt him once… we can do it again.' Mona thought, pushing off her two legs and going towards One Horn like a rocket. She bashed into his back, pushing him slightly.

At the same time, Oscar had retrieved his head, which was now by his side, forming a brand-new bone sword in his hand. From the ground rising through the snow, several weapons appeared in the area.

They were spear, axes, giant swords and small ones, but each one of them looked to have been created from bones. One Horn attempted to hit Mona who was behind him with a back fist, yet it missed and hit nothing but the air.

Despite her boost she wasn't faster than the Dalki leader, just able to predict his moves when needed. It was tiring and wasn't a hundred percent perfect, and with an enemy like him, a single miscalculation could be the end of her.

However, seeing One Horn's strength, letting him live might spell the end of the human race. He wasn't feared as humanity's bane after the first war for nothing. Oscar barged into One Horn, with the side of his shoulder, and tried to knock the Dalki down who quickly took a swing for his chest.

The sword had been grabbed, and split apart once again, for One Horn to deliver a great punch to Oscar's head. It knocked off the helmet he wore, that went flying and landed far off into the snow.

Now, where Oscar's helmet once was, a strange smoke could be seen appearing at the top of it. Grabbing another sword from the ground that he had created. Oscar swung a bone axe, hitting One Horn in the ribs, chucking him back a few steps.

Blood was drawn again, but none of the blows were deep enough to be fatal.

"You ants are starting to seriously piss me off!" One Horn shouted as he punched his two fists together. He then started to claw at his chest, creating two more large scratch marks, allowing his body to bleed more, giving him a boost in power.

When the axe had hit One's Horn's body it had broken, but picking up a spear this time, Oscar hurled it towards the Dalki. Seeing this, he hesitated slightly, before charging forward. Spinning his body, he avoided the spear and grabbed it.

The next second, the Dalki had it back towards his opponent. Mid-air, jumping towards it, was Mona, who attempted to grab onto the handle. It seemed like it did nothing as it took her along with the momentum…

A few moments later though, Sach, Linda and Samantha were all standing behind ready to catch her as her body hit theirs.

It looked like One Horn was going towards them, but before it could even reach them, Oscar was there and this time he held up his head in front of him. It stopped One Horn's charge, slowing it down, causing the Dalki to close its eyes.

At that moment, a giant hammer made of bones was swung down, hitting the top of its head. It crashed in the snow and against the ground creating a large creator underneath and even shook the Shelter they were away from.

Oscar was proving in this fight that his strength was no less than the five spike.

"When we all fought One Horn last time… no matter what we used, he was able to overwhelm us…" Samantha couldn't help but utter as she saw her father figure contend with his quasi murderer.

"Everything's changed." Sach explained. "None of us are human, for one. Before, a single punch from him would have knocked me out of this fight. This time I've already taken a couple and I can still keep going. This time there're more of us as well. Your father is a lot stronger!"

The second the bone hammer had crashed on top of One Horn's head, it broke, but seconds later Oscar picked up another one. The new weapon also smashed down on the Dalki leader, again with enough force to shake the ground.

The crater got deeper underneath the two of them. Another hammer was formed, and it was thrown down again, making it even deeper and large cracks began to appear. Snow was falling through the fissures that had been created.

Not stopping again, a large hammer was created, and it was thrown onto One Horn's head directly again, only this time, a hand was lifted above it, grabbing the weapon before it could reach its target. He pushed back against it, and soon another hand appeared to help the first one. Something was strange, though.

Grabbing on the large Hammer, all of One Horn's fingers could be seen, it was almost as if his hand had gotten…bigger.

Standing up from the ground, the hammer was grabbed by both hands, and by the second they realised that they weren't just imagining things. One Horn was indeed growing in size. Blood spilled out of his mouth, but his size was getting bigger by the second. He was already a large two metre tall Dalki, yet he seemed to be growing even bigger.

"This has to be it!" Samantha exclaimed. "The special trait we were warned about. Dad, get out of there!!" Samantha screamed at the top of her lungs.

Now, looking at One Horn, he was ten metres in height and was a colossal giant. Large Dalki wings sprouted from his back, and a tail started to grow as well. It wasn't special like Slicers but right now they were looking at a giant five spike Dalki, whose head could even tip over the Shelter walls.

"Holy crap, it's like what happened on those TV shows!" Fex exclaimed. "Power blamers! Wait, why doesn't that sound right?"

Looking down, One Horn could see Oscar below him, smaller than his foot. He smiled, before lifting it up, and slamming it down on him.

"This time, I'll make sure you stay dead, ant!"

*****

Chapter 1508 - Giant Dalki
The large foot slammed into the ground and chucked up the snow and pieces of the ground with it. It was clear that not only had One Horn's size changed, but his strength had drastically increased as well.

Most of the others stumbled as the strike was unexpected and as they lifted themselves out of the snow, Samantha looked towards the snow and could see One Horn's smile.

"NOOOOO!" Samantha screamed and squinted her eyes. "I…I…"

She was scared that she had lost her father once more. It was a pain that had taken a long time to heal, and Samantha wasn't even sure if she was actually over it. Seeing Oscar appear in his new form, how he had been with her, she had felt like a piece of her had slowly been coming back.

Samantha still felt guilty about the choice she had made at that time, but she couldn't deny that she enjoyed spending time with Oscar, even the way he was now…

Closing her eyes, there was a striking pain in her heart. Suddenly, they heard a loud neigh going off in the distance. Looking up, she could see that Oscar was now on top of his familiar. The large black horse spewed green mist out from its nostrils.

"He's…"

"Still alive." Mona finished the sentence, giving Samantha a hand and bringing her back up to her feet. "But that one needs to be killed."

It didn't take a genius to figure out which one Mona was talking about. The Dalki leader that even those inside the shelter could now see. Seeing the large head made those patrolling the walls shake in fear.

The battle was taking place around two hundred metres away, but those from the Earthborn group were frozen still.

"If that Dalki were to jump from there to here….it would destroy the shelter in a couple of hits." One of them uttered on the wall.

Fortunately, it seemed that One Horn was far more concerned with the surrounding 'ants'. Seeing Oscar still alive, he thought he must have been imagining things. Lifting his foot up, there was only a large imprint on the ground with a few crushed bones from the weapons, yet no body.

Which meant that the figure on top of the Horse was indeed the one he had been fighting so far. Angry, One Horn attempted to swat the horse away, yet the familiar jumped over the large hand, moving at a speed that surpassed even most vampire leaders.

Its feet hardly touched the ground as it looked more like it was gliding. However, the power behind One Horn's attack was so powerful that it created a wind force that managed to uproot the trees some distance away.

'How…how do we kill something like that?' Fex gulped down hard, as he looked up at the Dalki. He took back his black needle, he imagined Mona just had been getting tired of her blood being drained, and now instead he had placed it in himself. The Royal Knight immediately felt the surge of power, and he started to twindle his fingers making his red string go over each other again and again.

"What are you planning?" Sach asked as he approached his side.

"It's going to take a while, but I believe I can create a string thick enough to at least hold him in place… Honestly, I have no way of trying to kill him. I can only tie him up and make him trip or something, and he might even still break out." Fex replied. "Still, keeping him in place, might help the rest of you to somehow deal with him."

The others were thinking hard as well, but could think of nothing. Seeing Fex like he was, they all felt like they couldn't just sit back without at least trying to help out.

In the meantime, while the others were thinking. Oscar was taking action, he had brought out a bone whip. Galloping on top of his familiar, he had tried to wrap it around One's Horn's large leg quickly. Pulling on it, the bones pierced his hard scales and green blood painted the snow.

Unfortunately, it seemed to do nothing, as One Horn simply lifted his foot and stomped down again. The bone whip broke, yet they still weren't getting closer to a solution.

Instead, it looked like One Horn was going to act. He pulled back both of his hands, and shortly after threw them down at the ground one after another. Unlike the stomps with his foot, these blows weren't slow by any means.

Each fist hit the ground, creating large craters along with a piece of land to be thrown up. It felt like the whole planet was shaking with each hit. Eventually, one of the strikes even caused a pool of water to form in the crater.

The others tried to get out of the range of the attack, as One Horn seemed to be solely focused on Oscar. The Dullahan was constantly moving and still avoiding the strikes by One Horn, but then the Horse did something different. When avoiding one of the strikes, it looked to have galloped on the air itself.

Hitting the air, it created a cloud of green smoke from its hoof. It continued to move upward as if hitting a solid hall this way. The horse was somehow flying, without actually flying. Now getting close, it made One Horn's position slightly awkward. In Oscar's hand he had formed quite the large bone spear, but something strange happened, and it was as if the Bone itself had stopped forming before the spear could be finished.

Once again, Oscar could no longer rely on his bone powers. Somewhat similar to how ability users would run out of MC cells. Still, he threw the unfinished spear as hard as he could towards One Horn. Bending down slightly, One Horn allowed it to hit his forehead just to the side of where his Horn would be.

It had pierced its head but stopped short. Still, it looked like it had hurt him more than he had anticipated, as he flapped his wings in anger.

"Stop delaying the inevitable!" One Horn screamed in frustration.

Seeing this, the horse started to neigh in response constantly. Like it was scared or trying to say something. Back on the ground, watching everything and not being able to interfere, Fex's earring started to glow, and a few seconds later the little bull Ham appeared.

"Master, master, I have an urgent thing to tell you. It's the Horse King who wants to ask you all of a favour!" Ham urgently said. "He says, to keep the big monster occupied. Give him some time, and he'll be able to defeat it. Find a way to hold it still!"

Listening to these words, the others looked at each other. It was the only hope they had. Now, covering their faces from the heavy dust of winds, they could see that One Horn was following the familiar into the air.

The horse quickly turned away and started to run through the air, leaving clouds of green smoke behind, yet the Dalki leader Horn followed.

"NO!" Sach shouted out. "That's… they're heading towards the Shelter!!!"

The others quickly started running after, but were far too slow to keep up with the likes of One Horn and the Horse King, even for a group of super beings.

A short while later, still on their way, the whole ground shook countless times. They could only imagine what was happening, and when they got closer they could see what was happening as well. The sound of screams were heard throughout, but it was being drowned out by rumbling and explosions of power.

Eventually the group had arrived, but it was not the same place they had come from.

The walls had been destroyed, dead bodies lay in the snow on the ground, too many to count. It looked as if not a single person had survived. In the middle of the entire shelter. Walking through the walls, none of the structures were what they used to be, and it was hard to imagine that a single person, out of their army of fifty thousand-ish had survived the onslaught.

In the centre though, there were two beings, One Horn was no longer flying, and Oscar was there as well.

'Why…why did he come to the Shelter? He should have known everyone was here?' Sach thought.

Listening to this, and the fact that the Horse had run in this direction and what was ordered of them. She had some ideas, but she didn't want to say it. She didn't want to say what she thought in case it wasn't true.

"Come on, Sach, you're our Supreme Commander! We need to kill One Horn, once and for all! We can't allow the sacrifice of everyone here to have been for nothing! Pick yourself up, and let's do the job that we came here to do!!"

*****

Chapter 1509 - A Cruel Power
Mona's pep talk had snapped the rest out of their daze as they realised the real threat that was in front of them, but what could they do? Just how were they meant to hold One Horn down and make him stay still!

The Horse once again started neighing, and Fex, not having put Ham away, nodded as he began to relay the information to the others.

"He's going to start the process now, so you all need to do something. Just keep him in the general area, and make sure he can't fly." Ham translated.

"I think I can do something," Fex answered. "I kept rethreading my string powers over and over. Honestly, I'm pretty exhausted, but I think this is the strongest string I have ever made in my life."

While running, Fex had never stopped making string, even during the attack. He had it wrapped around his arm; it looked like he was carrying multiple thick scarves as the other end of it hung and touched the surface.

"To stop him moving, the two main things we need to wrap are his wings and legs, but…I don't know how we're going to do that." Fex said, holding onto the string and pulling it a couple of times for good measure.

"I have a plan." Mona smiled while staring at One Horn.

——

A few moments later, everyone was moving into action, heading towards One Horn. Seeing this, it looked like Oscar was putting faith in his colleagues. For one, he jumped off the Horse and landed on the ground.

He jumped backwards a few times using his powerful legs. He jumped like a grasshopper towards the Shelter and quickly got away from One Horn. Then placing his head on the ground, he was ready to take action, placing both his hands on the floor.

He was vulnerable right now, and if One Horn hit him with a single hit, he would be done for. Regardless, he could see a group springing into action.

The others were already in front of One Horn before the latter could even react. First, the Horse began to glide in the air, and he quickly charged towards One Horn and headed towards its head.

Seeing this, One Horn opened its large mouth and just chomped down on the Horse. The second he did, the Horse turned into green smoke and spread everywhere in the surroundings.

"What is this… there's no blood!" One Horn was surprised and a little dizzy as the green smoke had some kind of woozy effect on him.

"This is great; the familiar is helping us out..but with it just having died, it looks like it will no longer be able to help Oscar avoid those blows. This is going to be our only chance." Fex shouted as he had a fraction of the string in his hand compared to moments ago and was getting ready to do his job.

Being somewhat blind and in a daze, One Horn was swinging rapidly, and someone chose to take this opportunity as she leapt upon One Horn's arm. As he swung widely, Mona had to be careful and have a firm grasp of her balance. While he was swinging his arms trying to hit something, she had to hold on to some scales. Then when it stopped, she ran up the arm as fast as she could.

It felt like Mona was playing some kind of game. At the same time, in her hand, she held a spear. Mona had got this from one of the dimensional storage boxes she had around her waist. Rarely did she use weapons since her fists were always her choice, but once in a while, they would come in handy depending on what type of beast she would face.

Today seemed like their day. Tied around one of the spears was part of the string Fex had created. She hoped for her plan to work somewhat, but it would be tough.

Finally, running up, she was on top of One Horn's shoulder. He still seemed to be affected by the smoke, and now that she was also closer to the gas, she also was feeling its effects. Still, she quickly held her breath to not let it affect her anymore.

Mona looked at the weakest part of the wing where the scales weren't as strong. She thought there was a chance. She wasn't exactly weak, so she hoped this would work. Hurling the spear towards the wing, the spear pierced through, but it was like a dot on One Horn's wing. Anyway, it wasn't exactly meant to hurt him.

'One down, one more to go…I just hope the others will be okay. I don't know who has the hardest job out of this.'

It was then that One Horn acted and suddenly began to flap his large wings again. It seemed like he was going to take off. Perhaps return later when he was feeling better after healing, but the group had to hold him down at any cost no matter what.

And at this moment, Linda and Samantha came forward. They were the best option right now because of their strength, and their bodies also grew in size as shadows wrapped around them.

Seconds later, the two had grown significantly in size and had armour around their bodies. Linda had kept both of their armour sets in her dimensional space for a moment like this.

Linda ran to the closest leg of One Horn while Samantha ran towards the other one. It didn't take long for Samantha to evolve and get stronger with Linda as her teacher. At the same time, Linda, having been turned earlier by Quinn, was far stronger than she had realised.

The two of them grabbed onto One Horn's legs and began to pull him down. Their height came just up to his knees. Even though the two girls could be considered giants right now, they looked dwarf compared to One Horn.

"What is this?!" One Horn grumbled. He felt like his wings' coordination was quite off as they weren't moving in sync with each other. This was because Mona was also busy doing her work, and so were the two boys.

Mona tried to get One Horn's wings in a twist using her weapons and the string. At the same time, on the ground below, the boys swiftly ran around him, trying to tie up the legs, especially around the knees, to avoid the girls getting tangled up in the whole thing.

"It's working; our plan is working!" Fex thought as he continued to run around fast and was creating more red string just in case. He felt as if he was about to faint as if real blood was leaving his fingertips instead of the blooded strings.

Still, they weren't going to give up. It was only because of everyone's effort that they could keep One Horn down, and they felt like if any of them made a mistake, One Horn would escape.

"Please, Oscar... finish him," Sach muttered to himself.

While the others were busy holding One Horn, Oscar had been doing something that the others perhaps never wanted to see. As he put his palms on the ground, flesh began to fade from all the dead bodies around him. Soon, only their bones remained of everyone from the Shelter who had died.

This process was slow and took a while to complete, so he needed the others to distract One Horn. Now for the next step, their bones sank to the ground as well. They weren't just sinking. The energy from their bones was going to Oscar.

From this, something gigantic was forming around Oscar's body. The bones encased around him, and soon it was nearly impossible to see the original Oscar. The bones clad around his head and continued to grow in size, and eventually, he matched even One Horn in size.

It looked like a giant skull warrior was formed, and it had a single, huge double-handed bone sword. Inside somewhere around the chest area, was Oscar controlling such a creature.

"I think…this might be enough to finish the job." Fex smiled.

*****

Chapter 1510 - A Great Cost
Ever since One Horn grew in size, the group was constantly thinking of a way to kill him. His large size wasn't just for show. He had gained great strength, and on top of that, whatever attacks they made on him, it was no different than a mosquito bite to him.

In the end, they all had to put their trust in the Dullahan, Oscar, who had claimed he, or at least his familiar, had a way. It seemed crazy, but what other choice did they have?

Now seeing what trick Oscar had up his sleeve, they looked at the giant skeleton warrior and couldn't help but have a sliver of hope that this was enough to deal with One Horn just because both were similar in size.

"Hold him steady!" Mona shouted as she jumped off the back of One Horn. She had used her spears and the string to tangle the wings as much as possible, but they still needed to be somewhat held on with her hands, and it wasn't something she was confident in doing.

Luckily, the knots and tangling of the string did most of her work, and she was just relieved the string was somewhat holding out.

"We need to let that giant Skeleton deal with him! Only with him can we win this!" Mona cried again.

As the effect of the green smoke wore off, One Horn noticed the Giant Soldier in front of him and began to come to his senses. He tried to move his legs, but Linda and Samantha put all their strength to hold him down.

They dug their fingers hard into the scales, pulling downward as much as they could. If they were to break off their concentration for an instant, they would take off along with One Horn's legs.

The giant soldier moved its sword in front of him. He then took a stance and started running across the shelter floor the next second. The Skeleton was very heavy, as with each step, the ground shook and crushed whatever was beneath its feet.

It charged forward and thrust the sword right at One Horn's chest, but there was one thing that One Horn could still move quite well and hadn't been tied up, and that was his hands. At the right time, One Horn slammed them both making a fist punching the sword from both sides.

But the momentum of the Skeleton prevailed, and the sword continued to push forward, piercing the Dalki's chest. A great amount of green blood was sprayed out, gushed on the surface for the first time.

However, One Horn smiled as the sword came to a standstill and no longer went further in his chest.

"I think maybe you all forgot something!" One Horn shouted. His voice so loud their ears boomed, "Even in this form, the more blood I lose..., the stronger I GET!"

One Horn pushed the sword out of his chest still with his hands. And just when he was about to make a counterattack, he suddenly felt something strange on his leg - they were stuck in the ground, and he couldn't move them.

With the string and the two Girls, he could barely move.

"GET OFF ME!" One Horn screamed, trying to force his leg upward.

The thick strings looked like they were at their max tension, and a few of them began to snap.

"My…string," Fex said, collapsing on the ground. He had used his ability far too much and was exhausted from running around the enemy.

At the same time, the Skeleton soldier took another swing, and the Dalki threw out its fist. It moved its legs slightly to try and give more power into its punches, but the two on the ground continued to hold on tight. Their fingertips were bleeding as they rubbed against the hard scales.

"Keep holding on!" Linda shouted.

The sword clashed against the Dalki's knuckles, cutting the skin slightly, but couldn't reach the bone before One Horn flung it away again.

'We need to get a clean strike somehow.' Mona thought, looking up.

It was at the moment, though, that for a split second, Samantha's fingers had lost grip. Now, moving his leg somewhat more comfortably, more string broke off as One Horn raised his leg.

"NO!" Samantha shouted. She jumped up, grabbed the leg again, and attempted to pull it down.

"Get off my leg!" One Horn shouted. And he immediately stomped onto the ground, shaking the whole area and causing Samantha to lose balance and fall on her back. One Horn realised that he would need full momentum to defeat this Skeleton.

Intending to get rid of one of the ones causing him trouble, he lifted his leg and slammed it down on Samantha's body. She lifted her arms and pushed back the foot. She could see the scales, but for some reason, the strength didn't seem to be as much as she had expected.

"GET OUT OF HERE!" Sach shouted.

He was now under the foot. Blood Hardening was covering his arms as blood dripped out of his mouth. His eyes were almost bloodshot red. His bones and his strength were the only things holding up the body. Such a small figure was doing so much.

"I don't understand how I'm able to do this either. Maybe it's similar to one of those situations where the mother lifts a car to save her baby! Anyway, get out of here; that's a direct order from your Supreme Commander!" Sach shouted.

Samantha didn't want to move, but then she thought that perhaps she could push One Horn's leg from the side if she got out. She quickly rolled her body to the side and stood up, getting ready to push the leg.

However, when she saw Sach, she noticed a smile on his face. With her now safe, all his willpower slowly disappeared. Holding up the leg of One Horn for that long was already a miracle in itself. Even with his ability and vampire body, the pressure crushed his bones, and eventually, the foot had flattened on the ground, crushing Sach.

"NOOO!" Samantha shouted as she willed up all the strength in her fist and punched One Horn's leg as hard as she could. It caused it to twitch back slightly, and One Horn looked down as he felt the unexpected impact.

'How strong is she?' One Horn thought he needed to get rid of her first, but in that split hesitation of thought, the Skeleton had charged forward-looking to produce the same attack once again.

The sword was already close to him and was about to pierce his chest and then right through his heart. A moment of distraction was going to lead to his downfall, and there was no way to stop it.

"If I'm dying here today…then I'm taking you with me!" One Horn shouted as he moved forward with all his strength, breaking all the string and pushing away Linda.

He had run right through the sword, allowing it to pierce through his chest and heart but not before using his own hand aimed straight through the skeleton's chest, and he punched right through it. The bones shattered instantly, and a small figure was chucked out of the back, flying through the Shelter.

The whole Skelton began to crumble and fall to the ground, and the others felt as if their hope of defeating One Horn was gone at that moment. However, One Horn's body began to sway a few seconds later.

The rest of the group moved out of the way as he fell on his back, crashing down in his gigantic size. He took his last few breaths until, eventually, he was no longer breathing.

"Is it…over?" Fex broke the silence.

"I think it is.." Mona said. "The question is…at what cost.."

The Shelter around them had been destroyed; not a single person from it seemed to be alive. Samantha rushed over to Sach as she wanted to see his state...or whatever was left of him as tears streamed down her face.

"We...lost Sach." Fex eventually said in dismay. The two hadn't known each other for long or had spent a lot of time together, but fighting side by side with someone as brave and strong as him, Fex hated to lose to Sach. But now... the latter had gone ahead.

"I don't think that's the only one," Mona said, looking off in the distance where Oscar's body had landed.

*****

Chapter 1511 - A Loss Or A Win?
The others stepped towards the large crater caused by One Horn's foot. There were many craters in the Shelter, but this one, in particular, was larger than the others showing how much strength had been used in the attack.

They hoped to give Sach the respect he deserved by proper burial, especially since he sacrificed himself and was the Supreme Commander. It was something that others around the world would like to see.

Unlike the others who had been absorbed by the Dullahan, there should have been something left, but when they reached the crater, they were stumped by the scene in front of them.

None of them could recognise Sach. A red splat on the floor with the organs and bones completely flattened was in the centre, and there was nothing left of him. Witnessing this made them all realise the reality of what they had been through.

Samantha was still on her knees sobbing. She still couldn't believe that Sach would sacrifice his life for her.

"Why..why…me." Samantha started to cry.

"We can't do anything about this one, but we should at least check if the other one is alive," Mona conveyed as she was already heading to where Oscar was. On the other hand, Linda had decided to stay by Samantha's side.

While Fex headed off with Mona, he wanted to stay with Samantha, give her words of comfort, but he didn't know what to say at this moment, and he himself was distressed as well. He felt like perhaps Linda would be the adequate one to comfort Samantha.

Eventually, Mona and Fex came across the Dullahan. His body had crashed into a large pile of rubble. What was once a building was now just rubble with the Dullahan laying on top of it.

"Is he alive?" Fex asked. There was never a heartbeat with Oscar in the first place since he was an undead creature, so it was hard for Fex to tell just by looking at the body. The armour on him was destroyed, and his body seemed quite crushed.

Not in the same way as Sach, but it was hard to believe that the Dullahan would be able to walk again. Fex eventually saw a round object not too far, looking around the area. Running towards it, he picked it up off the ground.

It was Oscar's head, but it no longer looked like what it once did, with half of it being crushed from its head and one of its eye sockets. The only thing that was still intact was the creepy smile. He walked back with the head in his hand, returning to Mona.

"I think.. he's…dead as well." Fex eventually said. "We lost a lot...the humans lost the supreme commander, and now, someone who was strong enough to take out One Horn is gone as well. While we were…."

"We were enough," Mona answered. "All of us took part in defeating One Horn, and if he had continued to live…just look at this Shelter, it's thoroughly destroyed. One Horn would have gone Planet to Planet destroying the Shelters with ease. Perhaps even halting the human race's progress compared to what it is now.

"And…" Mona clenched her fist in anger. "Maybe it's better that he's gone."

"What do you mean by that?!" They heard a shout from behind.

Turning around, the two could see that Samantha and Linda had caught up to them. The former's eyes were glued to the head that Fex was holding. She stomped over, and he immediately handed it over as she snatched it from his hands.

Samantha fell to her knees again, holding the head and bringing it into her chest as even more tears rolled over her cheek. She had already cried a lot when she had lost her father once, and now she was going through the same thing again.

But soon, the tears of sadness were turning to anger.

Raising her head, she stared towards Mona, who had said the earlier words.

"What do you mean by that? What do you mean it's better that he died?! Don't forget that it was because of him that we defeated One Horn!"

Fex was wondering what to do. The one thing they didn't want now of all times was infighting, but he also couldn't comprehend the reasoning behind Mona's words.

"For one, we all took part in taking One Horn down. I doubt if any one of us weren't here today, then he would have easily slaughtered the rest! And I don't want to say it, but can't you see what he did?! Oscar came this way, and it was because of him everyone at the Shelter died, including my people, whom I had brought here.

"If you haven't figured it out, Oscar uses the dead's bodies to utilise his powers. I understand that it was to take down One Horn, but that doesn't justify what he has done. Nor does it help me quell my anger and feel sad for the ones I have lost!"

Honestly, Samantha hadn't actually thought about what Oscar had done a lot. She thought he had just run in this direction, but now looking around, she could see that there were no bodies at all. Where did all the fifty thousand corpses in the Shelter disappear to?

"I'm sorry, but that man wasn't completely your father. I have spent more time with the new Oscar, at least more than you. Yes, a part of him was still in there, but most of him was a monster created by Richard Eno to help us win this war."

It took some time for the rest to get a hold of the situation, and it was worse than they had thought. Sach, the supreme commander, was dead, the strongest force out of the Earthborn group was annihilated, and Oscar was no longer, so what were they supposed to do now?

"Without the Supreme commander, how will the Earthborn group function?" Samantha asked.

"Now you are thinking a bit more with your head straight," Mona nodded. "With Sach gone, someone has to take over his role. This war is important. It's still hard to judge whether this is a victory or a loss for us, but we must continue with the plan, and someone has to lead them.

"Samantha, Oscar, and Sach, the past two Supreme commanders, risked their life for you. They both deemed you as someone more important than themselves. You need to take up the role. Report to Sam everything that has happened, plan, and lead the Earthborn group further. We need to win this war... we have already lost too much."

Samantha thought about Mona's words. She wasn't as strong as Mona, she had kept suffering loss after loss, but she wasn't the only one. Everyone would suffer more losses if this war were to continue.

"You... you don't have to do this alone," Fex said, kneeling beside her and offering his hand. "I'll be there to help you... Even though I'm not like Sach or your father, I will stand beside you."

Nodding to this, Samantha finally stood up and looked around at the entire Shelter.

It was time for them to make their report.

Before leaving, Fex turned his head at the large Dalki corpse of One Horn. His body was still lying in the Shelter, and it hadn't shrunken down in size at all. Linda, who appeared next to him, was also staring at it. At the same time, Mona and Samantha were making the report.

"It's scary, right?" Linda said. "All the five spike beings are this strong. Slicer...One Horn... and there's still another one. It just makes me wonder if One Horn was this strong and wasn't the leader... then how much stronger is Graham?"

"We don't know if Grahm is stronger than One Horn, and sometimes the leader isn't always the strongest," Fex replied. "Also, I think having a large body here in front of us, filled with the blood of a five spike Dalki, might benefit us all a lot."

While staring at the corpse, an idea had flashed in his mind.

*****

Chapter 1512 - A White Flag
A little while ago, Sam had received news of the loss that the Earthborn group had suffered. Honestly, he hated to say it, but even the loss of Sach and Oscar was within his predictions. If he was being more honest, he thought there was a good chance that the Earthborn group would fail, and all of them would be lost.

If they were really struggling, and if the situation looked completely hopeless, Sam had instructed Linda to contact him. In that scenario, she would contact Quinn, and the latter would be the one to deal with One Horn. Thankfully it seemed like it was not needed. However, one thing he didn't expect was Samantha's willingness to accept the situation.

With her help, if the Earthborn group listened to them during these times, it would be much better, and hopefully, there would be fewer issues.

'I hate that I think this way.' Sam thought while sitting down in one of the combat ships. They were currently heading to their next destination. Thanks to certain groups in the Cursed faction army, they had successfully taken back eight of the nine planets that the Cursed faction once owned.

He and his group would be heading out to the first planet where the Dalki had gathered. Now, this was where the real battle would start, as they moved onto the planets that the Dalki owned, Sam had informed the other groups where the Dalki were located since many of the beast planets in the Dalki's side of the solar system, as it was called, were empty.

The groups knew where they needed to go, but Sam wondered how to use the advantage they had right now. For one, Fex and the others were quite far from where they were.

In the end, Sam had told him to ignore the other groups and come straight to the Dalki-occupied beast planet of the solar system. He imagined that 'help' that he had suggested would be best used there.

'Just one more planet for them to take over, and they will be moving out as well.' Sam thought, looking at the list.

The plan was proceeding quicker than Sam had imagined. The only reason he was entering the Dalki-occupied part of the solar system, which was left untouched since the treaty, was because the Blade group successfully dealt with the Dalki fortresses quicker than expected.

They were currently taking on the ninth and last planet that used to be owned by the Cursed faction.

———

The Blade family were currently on a planet named Erty. It was a planet that mostly had water with one big continent. This made it easy for the Blade group to find the fortress they were looking for.

Upon landing, they could feel the humidity in the air, and getting off the ship a distance away, the Blade family were ready to move.

"Is everyone ready!" Vorden called out to the people behind him. He was leading the army for now, and they were only groups with no vampire leaders by their side. It was just a small army compared to others.

Honestly, they had hardly lost anyone as well because there wasn't much work for the other ability users to do with Sil and the rest. The two now Demon tier beasts were unstoppable forces. Sil had a large pool of abilities to choose from since he had an army of ability users behind them.

Then there was Borden, who had more spikes than most of the Dalki in the enemy fortress. The others would just stay back for support, and most deal with stray Dalki who tried to escape.

The group began to march off, bringing along some of their equipment, trailers, vehicles, and more that would transport a large number of the group. Currently, the Blade family were riding ahead, leading the charge on a large four-wheeled vehicle.

The land was a bit rough and bumpy as the surface wasn't exactly the smoothest. Still, all of them looked off into the distance carefully with Raten behind the wheel. Although a demon tier beast, he could transform himself, and he was getting better and better at controlling his mud powers.

He essentially looked identical to a human while controlling things. That was when up ahead they could see something.

"Is that a Dalki?" Borden asked.

"It is, and it looks like it's holding up a white flag. Are they trying to surrender?" Vorden thought. For years, a white flag has been a sign of peace and surrender, but this has never happened when fighting against the Dalki.

"What do you want to do?" Sil asked as he was getting his hands ready to deal with the Dalki in front of them.

"It could be a trap, but at the same time, if we can solve this without fighting, then it will save more lives. It would be best if we talk to them." Vorden replied as he stood up and placed his hand out, gesturing to the rest of those behind them to stop advancing.

In the meantime, the vehicle continued forward, and when they were close to the Dalki, they all got off. Borden was still in his little form, and he would only take injections when needed, so he mostly stayed on top of Vorden's shoulder since that was his favourite brother of the lot.

The group looked around to see if they could see any Dalki. They could see the tip of the fortress in the distance, but it was too far away for them to come running towards them suddenly.

In the end, Vorden was the one who took the lead. Using his new black wings, he flew up and landed directly in front of the Dalki, who had no less than three spikes. However, in front of a beast-like Vorden, the two figures looked equally frightened. Their heads matched in heights, and a human seeing this wouldn't want to run into either of them.

"What's with the white flag?" Vorden asked.

The others didn't get too close, worried that they might make the Dalki feel anxious.

"We wish to surrender. We know what has been happening, and you have taken over every fortress so far. We don't wish to fight, but we just want to survive." The Dalki responded.

It was strange. Vorden didn't understand why now of all times.

"This is not based on our leader's orders but on us as a fortress. I can see you are confused, but we feel the other Dalki have abandoned us. We have received no help, and communication has completely been cut off from the main base. Please..we Dalki just wish to live."

There were concerns with whether they were telling the truth or not. For instance, the Dalki had a nature similar to beasts to kill those who weren't of the same kind. This nature even caused them to fight amongst each other for power.

At the same time, if they were to leave the Dalki, then what if the latter changed their mind and attacked them from behind. There was one more thing as well.

"You...you killed a lot of people in the shelter that was originally here. Some people want you all dead. You have to...you have to give me a reason to stop them. Your desire to live means nothing to them," Vorden stated. "First, tell me, why would the Dalki even abandon you?"

The three spike Dalki looked back for a second at the fortress behind him before turning around to the others.

"We have a short life span, and there is only one Dalki at the moment with a mind great enough to make it so we can live for a long time, like beasts which live on for thousands of years. However, our lives have been tossed to the side. With what little time we have left..we do not wish to waste it over meaningless conflict.

"You seem to know about us…you should know that there is a human side to us as well. The human side wishes just to live, and we know fighting against you would be a waste. If you really want, though, we will fight for our lives.

"As for your other questions..the reason why Graham has given up on us...is because he has already created something better than us..and he calls them the new Gen Dalki. If you continue onward to our part of the solar system, you will come across them..there is no longer a place in this world for us." The Dalki said.

------

At the same time, far away from here, Sam and the others had landed on the first Dalki planet that had condensed forces. Logan looked at the readings and could see the number of enemies was very high.

"We're close… we're close to the finale of this war." Sam smiled.

*****

Chapter 1513 - The Worst Outcome
A little while before Sam and his group had landed, they were carefully checking the planets nearby. Using Logan's devices that had been adjusted to track the readings of the Dalki instead of the demon tier beast showed that there really were no Dalki on the other planets.

Surprisingly as well, they were still working and hadn't been destroyed, including the ones on the planets with Dalki.

'Condensing their forces, are they really just using the same trick as us when we first attacked?' Sam thought. 'It doesn't seem to quite suit what they have done before.'

It was then, just before landing, that they had a call. It was from Vorden. He updated them on the information they had found out about a specific type of Dalki called the new Gen. The bad feeling that Sam seemed to be coming true, although there wasn't much information other than the Dalki being slightly different from what they had seen before.

It seemed like the Dalki themselves didn't know much about them either. Still, Sam needed to proceed with the plan and chose not to stray from the course. He also updated Vorden on what to do for the time being. He was to keep moving forward, for now it was fine if they left the Dalki as they were. Even if they attacked them from behind or went forward, it wouldn't disrupt their plan.

Sam was interested in talking to them some more if things didn't go exactly the way he wanted as well.

'A split between the Dalki is a good sign, maybe I could..no...We stick to the plan, keep going forward, and... we're going to kill the Demon tier beast.' Sam thought in his head.

The plan to kill the demon tier beast was Sam's main goal all along. Doing so would ruin the enemy's morale, stop them from creating more Dalki, and also, according to their information, killing one would mean that Quinn had obtained both of them due to the beast's special ability.

Killing the current Dalki wasn't going to help, and they needed to get rid of Dalki's goal.

'I'm not sure this is the right thing, but if Graham is planning what I think he is... then this will be our only chance.'

Upon landing on the Dalki planets, they noticed that they were less terraformed than the planets owned by the humans. Humans had tried to change the land somewhat to make it more habitable for every planet that they had.

Since the Dalki had low numbers, it made sense that they wouldn't bother trying to change the whole planet and just the areas where they lived. Because of this, though, mostly the Dalki planets followed a similar pattern .

The planet was overrun with forest, large lumps of rock that constituted barren lands, and then there were huge ice capes similar to the one they were currently standing on.

Although the patterns they produced on the ground were quite interesting, they looked like waves frozen in place all over, some larger than others.

Walking through the tearing, they were quite cautious about everything, but they had a strong force with them.

Layla, Sam, Logan, and Dennis were from the Cursed faction leaders. Then from the vampire side, there was Vincent on his own, but he did have those in the tenth family as well. For one, Xander had come on the trip while leaving Timmy behind to take care of most things in the family.

The vampires in this group weren't many, adding up to a hundred or so members at most, but they were vampires that Xander said he trusted within the family. Many of them had even volunteered, saying they wanted to help Quinn.

Lastly, from the other humans travelling with them, Peach, Ivy, and Ruby were there. Peach and Ivy were the leaders of the Daisy faction, and there was a large number of those from the Daisy group with them.

Ruby was close to Arthur, and the reason why she insisted on coming was that they still hadn't found her daughter. Her daughter wasn't on any of the planets they had reclaimed, and with no one to ask, they could only hope that the Dalki were keeping her somewhere for some reason.

"Do we really have so little information on this New Gen Dalki," Layla said as they continued to move on foot rather than use the vehicles.

This was because Sam wanted to look at this new Gen before facing them. How many spikes they had was his primary concern.

"I can bet on a few things from the knowledge that is in here," Logan said, tapping his finger on his head a few times. "The Dalki were created with a basis of different DNA that the vampires gathered at the time when they were trying to develop human substitutes, after all.

"Slight variations in genes perhaps would create a better substitute or wouldn't come with the defects they were looking for. This is one of the reasons why there is such a difference in strength between different Dalki. If they can condense the information of all of the current Dalki and use that information somehow, they can create more useful Dalki.

"My other guess is using the energy of the other half of the Demon tier beast, they have created a stronger Dalki. Rather than try to create as many of the Dalki as they could, like Jim had originally done, they just focused on creating the strongest."

Listening to Logan talk wasn't giving them confidence, especially since the Dalki were a frightening existence to begin with.

"What's the worst outcome? I mean out of the two." Layla asked.

"That would be if they combined both of them," Logan replied.

Since it hadn't come up as one of the options, Layla didn't want to think about it.

"It is troublesome. The Dalki being condensed like this isn't good either. One Horn was incredibly strong. Imagine if they had attacked with Slicer One Horn and Graham at the same time." Sam said.

"My guess was they were being cautious of Richard. Which is why he also had defensive measures in place, such as Oscar. If they managed to regain the strength that they have lost and are now fighting together, it would be tough."

The group was coming close to the source of readings, so Sam told the others to get some rest, eat up, and reenergize themselves. While the leaders would continue ahead to scout the area.

After all, the energy readings didn't tell them the numbers of the Dalki, so they were curious and alert. Eventually, after travelling a good distance away from the others, they came across something. It was the top of the fortress, and this one looked to be a bit wider than the others, but it was still quite close in size.

The group hid behind a giant landmass, and standing behind it, they could see far ahead and observed the fortress carefully.

"Remind me, do the Dalki have good eyesight like us?" Dennis asked.

"Not as good as vampires'," Vincent said. "At least not the old ones."

Looking out, they were trying to see if they could catch something important. It would be hard since the fortress itself was a solid wall, and most of the Dalki would be inside, but maybe along the top, they would be able to see something staring out, and to their amazement, they actually did.

The only thing was they had to rub their eyes a couple of times to make sure what they were seeing was correct.

"That can't be... can it?" Layla asked while glancing at the others around her.

Although they couldn't see how many spikes most of the Dalki had, one that stood in the centre appeared a bit more Human than the others. For one, its skin was mostly white, with scales running up it.

It reminded them of Borden when he would change slightly. There was still the tail feature and their gigantic size, but their frame looked different from anything they had seen before. However, that wasn't the shocking thing about them.

No, it was because, without a doubt, this Dalki, in particular, had a resemblance to someone they all knew. Seeing the Dalki, tears ran down Layla's cheek as she remembered what had happened.

"How could they do this…how could they use her like this?!"

*****

Chapter 1514 - Searching For The Leader
Sam's group wasn't the only one heading into the Dalki part of the Solar system. The Earthborn group was still busy reclaiming the lost planets in their section, and they were moving unhurriedly since many vampire leaders were helping them out.

Cooperation wasn't their strongest strength, and at the same time, they were waiting for an update on the situation with Sach. Still, after dealing with One Horn, they would soon start to speed up ahead. The Graylash family, led By Owen and Nicu, proceeded remarkably quickly, only a little behind the others.

From the Cursed family section, the one leading the charge of the war with the vampire subclasses was Sunny. She was also on her way, heading towards the Dalki part of the solar system. Bonny and Void were no longer with them since the task was far too dangerous and sent back to one of the Earthborn groups instead.

During her flight through space, Sunny had received an update from Sam.

"Sunny, you've done a good job, and the subclasses lost were under our estimations. I must congratulate you on your performance." She heard Sam's voice on the ship intercom. The latter was yet to land on a planet.

By her side, Sunny still had Rokene and another Female vampire who was there for support, listening in on everything. Sunny was one of the very few vampires who had left most of her castle vampires and inner castle vampires back in the vampire settlement.

"Thank you, but you don't have to flatter me. I know what needs to be done. I assume you didn't call me just to congratulate me." Sunny asked, wanting to get straight down to business.

"You're correct. We have received an update from Vorden regarding something new happening with the Dalki. He was unsure of trusting them, but in the end, I decided to let them live in return for information.

"There is something that you need to be careful about. There is something called New Gen Dalki, and they might be stronger than what you have faced before. If that is the case, I would suggest, at the worst, abandoning the subclasses and regrouping with another of the Cursed faction groups. Let the subclasses do as they wish.

"But I hope the situation won't come to that because I have another task for you. When gathering information from the Dalki, I asked where Graham would be and what planet he resided on. The answer was surprising, to say the least.

"Their base isn't located on any of the planets; rather, they ride in a ship that's the size of a large moon. Apparently, they had taken large parts of land from the planets or the moons near them to create it.

"I would like you to locate this ship. This is where Graham is most likely, and this is where the beast we are looking for will be."

Sunny had no problem with the mission and had accepted it. During her fight on the Dalki fortress, she realised that although the leaders were strong and able to take out the Dalki, what would have happened if they had attacked the vampires.

For one, the leaders would have never used beast gear, nor would they have had inner blood weapons. The leaders also didn't have haste to train and get stronger as Quinn had drilled into them.

It was quite possible that the Dalki would have quickly annihilated the whole vampire race as well.

"I guess everything that has happened has been for a reason." Sunny smiled.

The ship was heading towards one of the beast planets and was close enough to feel its gravitational pull onto the ship when Sunny was about to give instructions to steer away from the planet to search for the main Dalki ship.

They suddenly heard a beeping sound in the ship before she could order the move. Rokene rushed to one of the monitors to have a look at what was going on.

"Nina, activate the ship's defensive shields now!" Rokene shouted.

Nina quickly went over to the panel and followed the command. Usually, if an energy blast was detected, the shield would come online on its own. However, the ships the vampires used didn't have as strong shields as the Dalki motherships, but it was enough to survive a couple of attacks.

Quickly, Rokene rushed to the windshield, and he could see a black object heading their way. It wasn't large, but it was coming at a great speed, encased in what looked like flames. As it touched the shield, the shield could do nothing to slow it down as it pierced through it and hit right through one side of the ship.

"We've been hit, and it looks like more are coming our way. What do we do?" Rokene asked.

Sunny had to make a quick decision. The planet they were about to land on was one of the beast planets that showed readings of the Dalki, but she had just been tasked with something different. The question was can they get away? And if they failed and the ship was destroyed in space, they would lose all the subclasses as well.

While thinking, another object hit the ship, and the ship automatically sealed off that section to minimise the damage.

"Land the ship!" Sunny shouted.

Quickly, they activated the thrusters. The ship was large in the first place since it was a drop-ship filled with countless numbers of the subclasses. It started to head towards the planet, and at the same time, the enemy attacks had stopped.

'Was it trying to get us to land? And I don't see any of the Dalki fortresses anywhere...' Sunny thought. 'I guess I will have to deal with the Dalki here and whatever was making that attack and then head off to search. It will delay the mission, but I think we can deal with this quickly."

The ship was slowly approaching the orange-like wasteland of the surface. As they got closer and decided to steer in the direction of the enemy, they spotted someone on the ground.

"Is that just one Dalki?" Rokene asked, doubting her eyes.

What they were seeing was indeed just a single Dalki. It stood there surrounded by countless black spears dug into the ground. The black spears didn't actually look like spears but were just long and pointed at the end. It was a simple object created from the Dalki material.

It was then that the Dalki smiled and picked up one of the spears while staring at the ship.

"Too slow." It said as it threw the spear, aiming right for the back engine part. The spear passed through, and a loud explosion shook the ship as it began to tilt due to the impact. The front of the ship opened up, and the vampires jumped, landing on the ground. At the same time, the ship crashed not far away from them.

"Don't worry," Sunny said after getting up. "If there is a Dalki here, there will be another ship, and that won't be enough to kill the subclasses."

Sunny was right, as the containers were in good condition even against the attack. Soon the doors started to open on the containers, and out came rushing all of the subclasses at once.

"Now, this is interesting," Dalki said. "This will be a nice test to see if I can take you all on."

A single Dalki... Sunny couldn't imagine there was only one Dalki on this planet when she was expecting to face a whole colony. However, something else was distressing her even more. In the description of Dalki, Sam said they were all to look out for and to report immediately if they saw a Dalki sporting human clothes.

———

On a distant and far away planet, not in the beast solar system. There was one person who was going through an immense amount of pain. Not for a second had the pain receded since starting this process, but he couldn't give up.

Still, to make him aware of his progress and how long he had to continue suffering like this, the system was there to tell him.

Chapter 1515 - Meeting The New Gen
"How do we know that both fortresses were equal in strength?" Nicu slammed his hand on the table in frustration.

The Graylash group that Owen was leading was heading off towards the Dalki side of the beast planet. At the same time, the other group being led by Grim was about to arrive as well and was just a short distance away from them, only heading in a different direction. The group was in a garden-like hall with a stone table set in the middle at the ship's centre.

There was even a pond nearby with a small flowing waterfall. It certainly gave a calming feeling, but it felt strange to have a place like this in the ship, but that was just how Owen had always done things—he wanted to feel comfortable wherever he was.

Lifting his fan over his mouth, Owen let out a chuckle.

"What you say is true, but I thought the rules just stated who could clear a fortress quicker? Besides, it wasn't like there was a prize for this event or anything. Let's just say that they were stronger than the one I fought."

Nate, who was also at the stone table, felt a little uncomfortable, but he was just thankful that Owen wasn't so…childish. He was happy to concede defeat and go with Nicu's ways; in fact, he had been doing this the whole time.

Nicu wanted to make it a competition, and Owen had agreed; now, he was complaining again, and Owen was taking a step back once again.

"Pft." Nicu scoffed, crossing his arms. "And unlike us, you had a lot more people on your side."

"Ahem," Clearing his throat, Nate interrupted to talk about the matter at hand.

"We got a report from Sam. We need to be careful of the new Gen Dalki on these planets. I would suggest we slow down our pace a little and fight together from this point forward. It was good to let the humans and vampires fight separately, but now we might need everyone's strength. After all, I'm sure you all heard what happened with the Earthborn group led by Sach."

For the first time in a while, Owen had an expression of sorrow on his face. Although he covered up his face with his steel fan for most of the time, it wasn't hard to judge his emotions from his eyes, and Nate understood him very well.

Everything was going well, and all groups were reporting good news, but then the report about Sach's group arrived. In truth, they perhaps should be celebrating that One Horn was dealt with, yet… the loss of their comrades was much heavier.

"There still has been no report on Graham, so we need to keep an eye on that as well. Is there any update from vampires about Quinn? Is he on his way back? I've been keeping his shadow active for a while." Nate asked.

Nicu remained quiet for some time because he was in contact with the eighth family, who had the ability of telepathy. He was communicating with the vampire Shelter, who would, in turn, forward the message to Quinn's group.

"Yes... they're alright, but Quinn seems to be in the middle of something. Right now, they are protecting him and are fighting. Some reinforcements have also been sent from the settlement to support, so they should be fine." Nicu conveyed to the others in the room after disconnecting.

'Doing something? What are you up to, Quinn?' Nate wondered.

It sounded strange but knowing Quinn, it had to be important, and he was glad that the vampires were actually trying to protect him earnestly.

Eventually, the fleet of ships started to pull in towards their destination, a Dalki planet. However, there was a very serious look on everyone's faces this time, including Nicu's.

It was a relief for Nate because he was worried that others might continue to see this as a game. It would, of course, be their downfall if they didn't change their attitude.

When landing, the group followed Nate's suggestion, and now, the vampires were mixed in better among the humans since they will be fighting side by side. There were about a hundred thousand soldiers in the army, all assigned into platoons, with each platoon having five or so vampires.

At the front of the army stood a large group of mechs acting as scouts. They soon spread out and began searching for any sign of the Dalki or the fortress. They had purposely landed away from the energy signals to avoid confrontation as soon as they landed.

The planet they were currently at had enormous empty craters on the surface. They were quite deep, and some even stretched out more than a mile before returning to the level surface, and soon there would be another crater. With their enhanced sensors, the mechs were a big help in this terrain.

They knew the enemy wouldn't be on a plain or levelled surface; rather, they would hide.

"Still see nothing up ahead, but we are about to enter a huge crater." One of the Mechs reported coming to a halt and standing just on the edge of a crater. He was about to look down, but all of a sudden, a large hand had pierced right through the mech's headpiece.

A large arm was seen sticking through the mech, and the next second it was thrown off, falling to the side.

"Attack! I repeat we're under at- "The other one in the mech suit had only said a few words before it had fallen as well.

After a few moments, the main force witnessed two Dalki slowly stepping out of the crater, and soon there were more.

"Four spikes, three spikes…these are high-level Dalki? I can't even see a single one or two spiked Dalki!" Nate commented while summoning his shield with the shadow.

Just then, Owen made his move, activating the lighting on his foot; he charged forward.

"Mech Unit, fall back! Nicu, I hate to say this, but it would be a pleasure to have your help in this!" Owen shouted.

The four spiked Dalki are immensely strong, and it wasn't too long back when Owen would drastically struggle against one, but he had improved as well. But, just because he had made vast improvements and had confidence, he couldn't say the same for the others.

If the four spike and three spike got into the army's centre, they would cause a rampage. Looking ahead, Owen had a fist full of lighting. The ground was being ripped apart as he ran with his hand down.

However, as Owen concentrated on one, he soon saw another three spiked Dalki leap over his head and head straight at the crowd.

"Leave it!" Nicu shouted as he jumped up and pulled out his sword. The outside started to glow red, and Nicu slashed it several times in midair. The power of the beast equipment, along with his natural talent, gave him more additional strength and speed than before.

The Dalki was cut into pieces when he landed, and Owen was thankful he had a strong partner on his side.

"He did well against the three spikes, but there's a big jump in power whenever we face these guys!" Owen said as he suddenly accelerated and struck the Dalki right in its stomach. Its whole body lit up and blew before being shot back into the large crater.

Owen wasn't sure the Dalki was down for the count, so he went to look over and see if there were any more, but he paused for a second as he did.

"No…no.." Owen couldn't help but drop his metal fan onto the floor.

He found the Dalki fortress in the crater, but there was an army of more than a hundred dalki, and all of them were three or four spikes, and among them, he could see Dalki that had four spikes but appeared a little more... human.

Standing in the centre, on top of a tower in the fortress, was a male Dalki whose arms were covered in black scales, but his bare body and face remained mostly human. He looked up at Owen, showing its black eyes without a trace of white, a smile formed on his face.

"Welcome."

*****

Chapter 1516 - New Gen Succeed
At first, when Owen could see the number of three spike and four spike Dalki, he thought they were in for a serious problem. For a second, he even believed that the new generation of Dalki had to be referring to them.

After all, the group had never come across such a large number of high spiked Dalki, and the enemy could have easily used such Dalki in the first war to take over the earth if they wished.

This all changed when Owen's eyes focused on the human-like Dalki standing on top of the fortress in the crater.

Although he had the same number of spikes as the others, the level of threat Owen felt from him was very high.

Immediately, the Dalki started to run up the crater and charged towards the army. The platoons also got into the action and moved forward to take down the enemy once and for all.

'What do I do? That Dalki doesn't seem to move anytime soon, so should I stay here and protect the others...or should I be the first to make a move against the new Gen Dalki.' Owen was in a dilemma.

That was until he saw the chaos on the battlefield. The Dalki at the front were hit by countless different abilities and even got slashed with beast weapons, but these attacks had a negligible effect. One of the four spikes punched the ground, destroying the ground beneath them. At the same time, another Dalki delivered a kick so powerful that it killed a row of men, despite them wearing their gear.

At the same time, even those from the Graylash family were struggling. Their lightning powers were effective against the Dalki but could barely hurt the latter, much less kill them.

Owen could see one of his white robbed men jump and then moving like a lighting bolt, he had hit the Dalki straight in the stomach and caused it to bleed on its scales, but before the men could go for another attack, the Dalki placed its hand on former's head and ripped it apart from his torso.

"This is chaos!" Nate shouted as he punched a three spike Dalki right below its chin, sending it in the air, but he had no time to finish it off as another came towards him. He lifted his trusty shield in time, and as the Dalki's fist hit the shield, a smile appeared on Nate's face.

It began to glow, and the energy blasted the Dalki into the crater's curved part in the next second, destroying it. For Nate, the shield was great for combat if the enemy was attacking him from all sides.

He was faster than most Dalki, and it didn't matter if his own powers weren't enough to kill them; the demon tier shield would do that for him.

"You are a troublesome one." A voice asserted; Nate saw a hand in front of him, about to reach his face upon turning around. He looked into the Dlaki's eyes for a second, and all he could see was darkness. This was the humanoid Dalki, who had left the fortress and joined in on the fight.

'He's fast, faster than me...I can't get the shield in time. I'll have to use the shadow.' Nate immediately reacted.

Before the hand reached him, though, a strong Blood Swipe came and slightly changed the hand's trajectory. A red sword came swinging down the next moment, slashing at the Dalki's arm.

"Nicu!" Nate was surprised.

"Our people are dying, and this one is too fast for you," Nicu said. "Your shield can deal with most of them; leave this to me."

For a second, Nate wondered if he should help or not, but the next few actions from the two had proved what Nicu said was right. This Dalki was unusually fast. The more spikes they had, the faster their speed and power, but this one could keep up with Nicu without getting any injuries on its body.

Others around them heard several clashes just in a few seconds as Nicu slashed with his sword, and the Dalki tried to counterattack, going for his head. Every single blow from the Dalki had the power to finish off the young leader in one shot, but Nicu was somehow able to hold out.

Looking around, Nate could tell their army was losing men and losing them incredibly fast. The enemy only numbered to a hundred or so and was fighting against an army of close to a hundred thousand people, yet it was the army that was being slaughtered.

'Right now, I need to do what I can.' Nate thought as he went into the fray, hoping to deal with them as instructed.

Meanwhile, seeing that Nicu was dealing with the strange Dalki, Owen decided to protect his people as much as possible. Eventually, summoning his soul weapon and throwing it up into the sky, he moved to change the tide of the battle.

Each lightning strike from above would stun the Dalki for a few seconds, giving him a chance to take them on one at a time. Just as Owen was getting ready to move forward, three four-spike Dalki surrounded him.

"Get out of my way!" Owen cried in anger. A single bolt from the sky struck the Dalki, stunning one of them on the spot. Owen quickly hit another in the stomach, but it stood its ground and kicked Owen right in the chest, sending him flying back.

Blood trickled down from the corner of his mouth, but he needed to get up and deal with them quickly.

'I need to stay calm…I need to think of a way out of this.'

The fight continued between the humans and the new set of Dalki. Every time Owen would see some type of opening and deal with one of them, stronger ones would charge towards him, and honestly, he was getting quite tired.

With Nate, the understanding of what his shield could do started to spread among the enemy Dalki. Even with his vampire and Qi powers, a four spike was still difficult for him to deal with. Thankfully, the Demon tier shield gave him extra stats to help him deal with a few of them.

Yet, it was clear there was a certain strategy in place. All those that would give the Dalki trouble were targeted and surrounded. At the same time, they weren't necessarily trying to kill them and were slowly being forced down, not allowing them to help the others.

Even Nicu, who was trying his best to hurt the four spike, had eventually caused some cuts and bruises here and there, but the Dalki hadn't changed its own attack pattern and just continued.

It was hard for them to tell how long had passed, but they had been fighting non-stop, to the point where each of them had to now worry about their MC cells. Nicu and Nate were in a better state since drinking some of the Dalki blood of their fallen targets gave them an energy boost.

Nate had used his shadow in a dangerous situation, even protecting those around him.

On the other hand, Nicu was getting frustrated and was making more mistakes and even got hit on his shoulder by the human Dalki, and was now forced to step back.

Eventually, Nicu, Owen, and Nate had backed themselves up towards each other without realising it. Around ten or so vampires were still fighting, and nearly two-thirds of the Dalki were taken out, but out of the hundred thousand they had brought with them, these vampires were the only ones left.

"Regroup!" Nicu shouted, and the vampires soon came towards them, and now huddled up and tired, they all wondered what to do. Owen no longer had his soul weapon out because it was using too much of his energy.

"We have to get out of this," Owen said.

The Human Dalki was smiling at them, and the other Dalki started to walk ahead towards them as well. Around twenty of them were still alive, and only the last few people from the attack group.

"Is this how it ends for us?" Nate gritted his teeth. He tried to contact Sam upon seeing the disadvantageous situation during the fight, but there was no response. Honestly, he was worried that everyone at the moment who was in the Dalki solar system was facing a similar problem.

"There are not that many left." Owen smiled. "Why don't we have a competition to see how many we can take out."

While saying these words, Owen found it hard even to lift up his arms.

The Dalki charged at them, and the group of vampires was ready to protect their leader. But after a few steps, the Dalki noticed something from the side; however, it was a little too late for them as a tunnel of ice came out from the side.

The second it touched the Dalki, their bodies began to freeze on the spot. Soon, three Dalki were caught, and half their bodies were frozen. Just then, a large blade appeared and sliced one of the Dalki in half the next second.

"….What is she doing here," Nate said in disbelief. "I've never been this pleased to see her."

Chapter 1517 - Constant Internal Struggle
A mixed bag of emotions. Honestly, when Erin had decided to leave the others and go on her own, away from her friends, she was heartbroken inside. She had already lost her family once, and because of that, she naturally pushed others away.

Yet, slowly, some people had managed to move into her heart once again, and Erin became a little soft towards them. She had decided to get stronger because she wanted to protect those around her, but the one thing she never thought she would have to do, was to fight those closest to her.

It was a thought that she couldn't bear, something that she couldn't imagine, and in the end, she had decided to leave the settlement. The teleporter in the tenth castle had been used to send Erin back to the Cursed ship.

When Erin reached her destination, she didn't greet the others or inform them of what she was doing. Instead, she had decided to do something else, and that was to get as far away from everyone as possible. There were a few things she had learned about herself, like, similar to a vampire, Erin could also use influence skills on people.

Although it seemed like this wasn't as strong as her counterparts, it was enough to convince the person-in-charge of the teleporter room.

'I have to get away from the Cursed faction and any of the vampires. Even on this ship, I can still feel it,' she thought.

Eventually, she headed through the teleporter. After going through several steps, she found herself on one of the three Earthborn Planets that were considered safe. The planet seemed quite peaceful, having hardly suffered from Dalki attacks, and there were plenty of people in the Shelter.

In fact, there were so many people that Erin felt a little trapped. After all, many from the other Shelters had to come to this place, including Civilians. In the end, the Earthborn group had to build two shelters on the planet to accommodate everyone.

One, for the general civilians and a group of men to protect the place. While the original was for the bulk of the military. They built the Shelters relatively close to each other; if there was any trouble, the military could come and help.

In the first place, they only considered this safe to do so because the Dalki attacks were so scarce.

One day, covering herself in a grey robe, Erin walked down the street and entered a tavern. Unlike vampires, she needed to eat regular food.

Eventually, the server came and served a steaming hot meal. Pulling out a money card, she proceeded to pay the man with her credits, but there seemed to be an error when attempting it to go through.

"Right, sorry, but it seems like the payment didn't quite work. Do you have another money card on you, perhaps?" The man politely asked.

The money card she was using was her own, and this money was from what she used to get from being part of the Cursed faction. They would hardly ever need to use it, though, for two reasons: Being close to the Cursed leaders meant it was almost impossible for them to pay for things, and if they did need money, they had a member of the Green family who was happy to top up their cards whenever wished.

However, she was no longer on the Cursed planets, the vampire settlement, or in contact with Logan to get his help. For now, to escape her predicament, she had no choice but to remove her hood and look the man in the eyes.

Seeing her beautiful long blonde hair and pretty face, the man was almost getting red just looking at her.

And just as she was about to use her powers.

"It's okay, the meal's on the house." The man suddenly smiled and walked away.

She was left alone, in the corner with her food, and dug in quite quickly.

'I can't keep using my powers like that…it feels wrong.' Erin thought. 'But that means I'll have to come up with a way to make some money.'

After finishing her meal, she eventually saw that everyone's eyes were glued to the screen. As for what they were watching, it was none other than Quinn. He had returned from the vampire world, and right now, they were heading to the Daisy faction base.

She continued to watch every bit of it, as Quinn was filled with anger and had killed the Dalki with ease. Those in the shop couldn't stop talking about the whole event. When the broadcast ended, they continued to discuss it for hours while Erin was left with her own thoughts.

'Quinn, you have gotten so strong. I thought maybe I could get as strong as you…but now I'm a little scared of what will happen if I do.'

Right now, she couldn't feel the urge, but it was because she could tell that there wasn't a vampire in the Shelter they were currently at. Perhaps if she lived a successful life away from vampires, away from them all, she would be alright.

Still, there was something at the back of her mind that was itching her bit by bit, even if there weren't any vampires. Thankfully due to Leo's training, she could control it, at least this much.

Putting on her hood, Erin continued to wonder for the next couple of days, but that wasn't all she did. At night she would wander the streets, even though she didn't know why she was doing it, but it was as if she was looking for something.

Then one night, while roaming through the streets, it hit her like a wave. An incredible feeling rushed through her mind, and her back was covered in sweat. Like radar, she could quickly pinpoint where this sensation was coming from. Running through the roads of the Shelter, she turned down an alleyway and saw two glowing red eyes.

Without a second thought, she pulled out her smaller katana-like blade and dashed forward, slashing at the vampire. The attack was swift. The vampire didn't even have time to react and was killed on the spot, sliced in half.

A human was trembling and frightened on the street floor down the alleyway.

"Thank you…thank you so much that man came out of nowhere."

Turning around, Erin looked at the person, a young woman. Walking forward, she had the biggest smile on her face.

"No worries. I'm glad to see that you're alright."

The woman didn't know why, but getting up, she immediately ran away and headed back home. What Erin didn't know was her smile didn't look like one that was happy, but one of someone who was enjoying the moment.

Touching her face, she could feel the edge of her smile not going down.

Seeing that the person had run away from her at that moment. Erin fell to her knees.

"What have I become…what is this…but that feeling, I can't forget that feeling," Erin muttered. She knew that she had enjoyed the sudden feeling of killing the vampire.

She was afraid that even if she chose to live a life in seclusion, she would eventually lose out and seek this feeling once again. As she was deciding if she was ready to give up or not... but a certain person's smiling face flashed in her head.

"Layla... I miss the days when I just talked with you; I missed seeing you drool over that idiot Quinn; I miss the scaredy-cat Peter and the charismatic Vorden. I just want to go back to those days. Is that so much to ask?" Erin sighed.

Getting up from her feet, she took a deep breath and placed her blade away.

"I have to control this urge, and I have to do it if I ever want to return to them one day. And I know I will overcome this."

Knowing Quinn's plans were: the alliance between the humans and the vampires. And she was an existence that could sink that plan, so no matter what, she needed to control her urges if she wanted to help in this war.

Chapter 1518 - The Vampire Hunter's Problems (Part 1)
Rumours were starting to spread within the Earthborn faction that perhaps there soon would be a fight on their hands. Everyone knew that it would happen at some point and time, but those that were in the Shelter a little away from the military were frightened. Of course, they would be, since they had little defences.

While walking the streets, Erin was listening in on all the surrounding conversations. It was a skill that she had often done when travelling with Leo. Although vampires had great hearing, all the noise at once made it hard to focus on just one, making it a skill she had needed to pick up.

"I heard there is a mass recruitment in the other Shelters. The Earthborn faction wants to get everyone with some type of useful ability to head towards the frontline."

"I mean, at some point, if the military and the other factions don't win this, then we would have to fight for our lives anyway."

"They're not doing their job. We should just head to Earth, or try to head to a different solar system where the Dalki can't reach us. That should be possible, right? I don't know about you, but I'm still scared about the vampires. I heard they attacked and sucked someone dry just because they looked at them funny."

As expected, Erin could only hear news about the upcoming fight. What she was surprised about, though, was the fact that there was no news about Quinn after he had made that declaration to the world. Based on the way the Dalki had acted in the past, the Dhampir had been sure they would react, yet so far there had been nothing.

'I wonder if the Dalki are planning something. Everyone is too scared to act and is just waiting, but if we just sit here and wait while our enemy is preparing to get stronger and improving, it will be our loss.' Erin thought as she took a deep breath.

Every once in a while, she would get reminders of what had occurred the other day. She had been trying to harness those feelings… but right now, the young woman needed to find a way to make money.

"I heard that the new General Longblade has sent over his right-hand men to this Shelter, Rafer Lyle. I thought it was to protect us, but I've heard the guy has been looking for people willing to go out on a hunting expedition with them!"

"I mean, we still need crystals and equipment times like these, and although there are a lot of people here that aren't strong enough to go against the Dalki we could still do some fighting."

This seemed like a good way out of her financial situation. At the same time it would be a good way to help her with her personal problems. So far only two things allowed her to keep sane. One of them was meditation, but that severely limited the amount of training time. The other was fighting other things that weren't vampires.

After gathering enough information, Erin discovered the location of the recruitment process for the beast hunting teams. Just like how Travelers would be ranked and be allowed to search for beasts, the same would be done here.

The Dhampir soon arrived at a courtyard of a grand manor that was being used by Rafer and other high-ranking officers during their stay here. All those that wanted to take part had gathered in an open field and a test was being conducted.

The test was simple enough, they were asked to fight against one of the Earthborn soldiers. After a little sparring match. Based on their results, they would be put into different groups.

Behind the soldiers there were three circles that had been drawn on the ground and each one was being told to go into a different circle.

"Next!" Rafer shouted out to all of them, with his hands by his side. He was quite the large and busy man, yet he still had a smile on his face most of the time. He also took his work seriously and knew when to be kind and tough on others.

In the middle section there was a red haired man who looked like a teenager walking forward.

'Huh, isn't that?' For a second, Erin was sure she had recognised him.

As the soldier charged forward to attack, Berg spun around, avoiding the sword. It looked slow at first but then from one of his elbows emitted fire from behind. Using the power of his flames he accelerated the spinning in his body and hit the soldier in the side of the head knocking him down to the floor.

It was the first contestant that was able to completely overwhelm the soldiers out of all of the ones who had taken part so far.

"Power of fire? Doesn't that mean he's from the Sunshield family? I guess the red hair makes sense now."

There were plenty of whispers after seeing him in action, and Erin was right. Berg was someone who had also gone to the same academy as them. He was a favourite and a talented student, rising to the top. At one point and time, Erin had treated Berg as her rival. However, it hadn't taken her long to realise that she needed to worry about others if she wanted to be the best.

A childish dream that seemed so long ago, yet it had been merely a few years…

"Third circle!" Rafer announced.

The third circle had the least amount of people, there were only around eight in the group in total. Then there was the middle section with around fifteen or so, and lastly the end circle that had the most number of people, numbering around fifty.

It was clear that the circle Berg was in, was considered the best.

"Next." Rafer called out, and it was finally time for Erin to go out.

Currently, Erin had the large sword on her back not just in its specially made scabbard, but she also had it wrapped in cloth. Not only would it be strange for someone to have their own Demon tier weapon, but since it used to belong to the previous Supreme Commander Oscar, everybody in the military would instantly recognise it. Still, even on her back, she could still activate it and benefit from the additional strength a Demon tier would usually produce.

Looking at her opponent in front of her, the soldier wielded a long sword. Erin pulled out her katana blade. It gathered a lot of attention due to its shape and red colour. One could tell it was quite high-level, only they didn't know that it wasn't a beast weapon at all.

The match began, and the man charged in, the first thing Erin did was sweep her foot across the ground, chucking some dirt into his eyes. At that moment, she struck to his side, but the soldier was able to block.

She went for another attack which was a little faster and hit the shoulder guard of the shoulder. This continued, and the soldier was clearly being overwhelmed, but eventually, he stomped on the ground, and a pillar rose in front of Erin, hitting her in the stomach.

A second before it reached her, she lept back and fell on her back side.

"A speed user. Although your ability is not great, you knew the right spots to attack. You've earned a place in the second circle." The soldier instructed after giving her a hand.

This had, of course, been Erin's plan all along. The Dhampir didn't wish to sit out, though she didn't consider it wise to go in as the first circle either. She had a feeling that something was up anyway.

After the testing was complete, Rafer went to the first circle, where Berg and the others were.

"All of you will head to the other Shelter and prepare yourselves!"

They soon looked at themselves with confused looks. Why were they going to the other Shelter if this was meant to be a beast hunting force, but the others soon cached on.

"You disappoint your fellow humans. With as much power as you have, you decided to hide it and run away to this Shelter! You should be on the front lines fighting with that strength."

The others couldn't really argue with this, because they knew that they had hid themselves. Perhaps there was even more today that had done the same thing as Erin not showing her full power and had figured out what the army was trying to do before them.

For a second, though, Rafer looked towards Berg.

"You, kid, how old are you?"

"Nineteen, sir." Berg replied.

"And you, the one in the hood…come forward." Rafer requested.

It was clear that he was talking to Erin, and her heart started to thump. Not yet, she wasn't ready to go on the front-line just yet. Not when she would be placed among other vampires.

Chapter 1519 - The Vampire Hunter's Problems (Part 2)
Erin did as she had been told and walked out of her circle. The others weren't sure why these two had been called out, though the young woman feared that they might have realised that she had been holding back.

Rafer first looked towards Berg before explaining: "You two will be coming with me. We will be making a special beast hunting team. As for those within the second circle, you'll be hunting Advanced tier beasts and King tier with the support of some military personnel.

"The first circle group will be fighting Intermediate and Basic tier beasts. We'll assign you a captain, and you'll listen to their orders, understand?!"

The others didn't disagree with this, and the only ones that seemed somewhat upset by their situation were the ones in the third circle that were forced to move to another Shelter.

"Please... My family lives here. I need to protect them if the Dalki come!" An older man ran out, getting on his hands and knees to beg Rafer to be allowed to stay.

"I understand that this is a hard time for everyone. I promise that we will ensure that your family will be safe here. However, we need more people who are strong like you to fight the Dalki with everything we have. If you think you alone can make a difference, should the Dalki invade after they have gone through all of us, I'm afraid you're living in a fantasy and not the real world."

The man pleaded some more, yet to no avail. His head sulked as he gave up on the idea. It was true he wanted to look after his family, but it was also true that he didn't want to go on the frontline against those beasts.

Eventually, heading into the manner, there seemed to be some sort of special meeting that had occurred. For now, Erin had sat down on a sofa, and Berg was sitting opposite her with his arms crossed. He had no beast gear on, and he was in a sleeveless shirt.

It looked like he had a rough time, perhaps it was due to what had happened to the Sunshield family. With them being disbanded and mostly destroyed, only a few of them were left alive. There were more than a handful of factions and families that held grudges against them, because of the Big Four. In the past, two of the families seemed to bully their way through compared to other families the most.

One being the Sunshield family, the other one those under the Truedream flag. Berg started to try to get a peak at the hooded girl's face, when he eventually had caught a good look.

"Erin... I can't believe it. What are you doing here?" Berg stood up in shock, before immediately sitting down. Then, a little worried, he whispered. "Aren't you with Pure?!"

When Erin had left the military academy, there were many that had accused her of being part of Pure, and that they had taken her back. It looked like some still had this impression of her. With no need to hide who she was, and not really caring, she pulled her hood down, revealing her blonde hair.

"Calm down, I'm not with Pure. That was all a set-up. I was with the Cursed faction for a while, and now I'm on my own due to none of your business." Erin claimed, crossing her legs and looking away, wondering what was taking the others so long.

It was clear that Erin didn't want to talk based on the short interaction the two had had, but Berg couldn't help but stare at her. For more reasons than one, Erin was an ice queen beauty at the school.

Yet how, in the short time he didn't know her, had she become even more beautiful. On top of that, he knew her ability was ice, so why hadn't she used it.

Just as Berg was about to pop the question, the doors opened and Rafer was seen walking through. There was another soldier by his side, and what looked like two other Travellers. From what Erin had gathered, they had done similar tests around the Shelter beforehand. Of course, one centre couldn't just measure everyone that needed to be measured.

Although she had also heard news that they were forcing some people to take tests as well. Whether it was right or wrong was a different thing. She could tell that fear was running through the military, of experiencing the same thing that they had done once before.

Before Rafer spoke, he looked at Erin for a few seconds. He was surprised to see such a young woman under the hood. He wondered why such a beautiful person would cover their face like so, but he knew it was rude to stare and went on with the reason they had been gathered.

"Sorry for springing such a surprise on all of you." Rafer apologised as he gestured the other two to sit on the third sofa that was positioned around the square table in the room. Rafer was the only one that was standing while he made his announcement.

Erin glanced at the two others, and tried to sense if there was anything strange about them. Neither of them had Qi, nor were they vampires, that was for sure, but their beast gear was at a good level.

One was a short white haired young adult with a crossbow type beast gear weapon. Something that Erin rarely saw. The range on a crossbow was less than that of a bow, but the advantage was usually the power and speed at which a beast crossbow could be used.

"Now that everyone is here, I want to inform you about the task our special team has." Refer explained. "The white haired Traveller goes by the name of Conan. He used to be part of an A Rank faction and was an A Rank Traveller in the past."

This had come as a surprise to Erin. For one, she thought for sure that if there were any A Rank Travellers they would have been sent to the other Shelter, so why was he here?

"Then we have another Traveller, that goes by the name of Brook." Rafer continued.

Knowing that the white haired man was Conan, Brook was clearly the muscular black man who had tribal tattoos going all the way down his forearms. Although his tattoos and muscles screamed intimidating, his smile showed another story.

When he looked at everyone, he seemed like the most gentle person in the world. It was such a nice smile that some were even put off by it. His choice of weapon on his back was two sickles. Something that would have been used as a farming tool in the past, but since they were beast weapons, Erin was sure they were far more effective.

"Now, I don't want you guys to be shocked when I say this... but the reason we have gathered you all is that we have discovered the location of a Demon tier beast. One that if turned into another weapon might help us tip the scales of war into our favour."

Everyone in the room was left speechless. A Demon tier beast such a rare existence, and them, who felt like nobodies were going to go after it. It felt like an elaborate prank was being set up on them.

"I'll explain a little further for you all. All the factions on the other planets are busy, and I'm sure you know that the other planets are now in control of the Dalki. If anything, finding a Demon tier beast on the few planets that we have is a blessing.

"Also, it's not a humanoid beast, so you don't have to worry too much. No sorry, please do worry since it's a Demon tier beast, but not too much." Rafer started to chuckle, but no one else felt like laughing at this situation.

"How…how are we meant to fight such a thing, just with five of us? I heard all the leaders fought against the last one. How could we defeat such a thing on our own?!" Conan immediately questioned this entire idea.

"That's because you guys are special. I'm sure you know not every Demon tier beast is the same, and we have it on good terms that we should be able to achieve this task with just us."

Hearing this, the others wanted to pull out from the job, but could they even.

"What about me?" Erin asked. "I... am not strong like these guys. Why was I selected?"

She wasn't sure if Rafer was able to see through her facade or if it was something else, but she needed to know.

Scratching his head, Rafer gave her a surprising reply.

"I'm actually not too sure about that myself. You see, there is one more person that will be coming on this expedition with us. She was actually the one who gave us information on the Demon tier beast. The only thing she wanted in return was to accompany us… as well as for us to recruit 'a person in a grey hood, no matter what."

Just as Erin was beginning to guess who it could be, someone else stepped into the room, walking in with a staff in her hand.

"Well, it's been a long time, hasn't it?" Bliss greeted the Dhampir with a smile.
