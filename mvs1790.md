# Chapter 1790: Wake up!

Although the power of Erin's flame attack was nowhere near her previous attack just moments ago that had caused everyone to fall asleep. It was still impressive that someone could disperse the flame attack from a Demon-tier beast weapon with a single punch. This show of strength had even impressed Borden's opponent, Erin.

"A single punch. What strength you have," She narrowed her eyes for a moment, "I didn't sense any use of Qi or anything else. You simply did that with raw strength? That certainly is amazing"

On top of this, another remarkable thing about him was that Borden didn't seem to have any injuries even after taking Erin's attack head-on. There were only a few scales on his face and arms, and no spikes were sticking out of his back. Yet he was able to draw out this much power, something he couldn't have done before. When looking at Borden now, he could easily be mistaken as a normal human if one didn't pay close attention to his features.

Not far away from the battlefield, while the others were seeing the confrontation in front of them, they suddenly felt a gust of wind, and Jake landed in front of the group.

"What are you guys doing? Come on, we have to help him!" He turned around and frowned at the group.

"What do you mean?" Lucia asked, "He just managed to get rid of those flames with a single hit. Can't he take her down on his own?"

Just like the others, Lucia had improved in strength by leaps and bounds after meeting Quinn. However, she knew it was nowhere near the level of power Borden had just showcased. The flame tunnel attack would have completely overpowered her blood lightning attack, and she would have been dead before she knew it.

This wasn't why she wasn't so quick to charge in.

"Didn't you notice? Or have you guys gone blind?" Jake shouted with a panicked look on his face.

"That damn woman they call their Queen, she didn't receive a single injury in her fight against Laxmus She's completely fine. We have to do something Borden alone can't stop her for long!"

A look of horror dawned over everyone's face at that moment as they released what Jake had said was true. Her armour didn't even look scuffed, and although there were some difficult moments for Erin during the fight, she hadn't received any fatal wounds at all. Instead, she looked complete normal and didn't even seem worn out.

"Stay here!" Peter opened his mouth as he went over to where Jake was and turned back to the others. Then, addressing the group, he continued, "Don't come too close. There is a good chance you guys could get hurt as well!" With that, Peter and Jake were already running to where Layla and Erin were.

Not long after, Minny, Jessica, Muka, Hannah and a few others like Mitchell had managed to catch up and regroup with Lucia at the ruins of the building and stared at the battlefield. "They killed Laxmus... The dhampirs they were successful in killing our leader," Ashley pursed his lips, "Did this all happen because of me?"

Many vampires at that moment questioned themselves as they realised the leader was dead and the Guardians, who no longer had their shadow powers, felt hopeless, to say the least.

In the end, the Red Vampires were hanging onto one thing. It was the fact that they could still see their other leader, Layla. She was still alive. But for how long?... it was hard to tell.

*** *** ***

Despite seeing Borden taking out her attack, Erin had only shown an initial surprise but was mainly unfazed as she tightened her grip around her sword and looked like she was ready to clash again.

However, her attention was elsewhere as well. It was as if she was looking at other things around her, and it was true because she was interested in a particular item that Laxmus had taken away from her, and she could sense where it was.

"Sorry, it's Borden... It's been a long time. I'm sorry I messed up your name." Layla said, both hands on her knees, struggling to stand up. Her head throbbed in pain, and her vision was constantly blurry.

"Thank you, but please don't risk your life... leave this place and help the others get away from here as well."

Borden didn't turn around as he was carefully watching Erin. He had a hunch that if he moved from this spot, Erin would instantly attack Layla. But, honestly, it was as if Erin wasn't bothered by Borden, apart from the fact that he was getting in her way.

"Layla, you don't have to worry about me. I have lived a much longer life than I ever anticipated!" Borden shouted as he threw his fist forward. One thing to note was that he didn't step forward and threw it for where he was.

Everyone heard a loud bang again, and although it was completely invisible, with the help of her ability, Erin sensed that a dangerous attack was heading her way due to her ability. Immediately, she moved to the side and moved quite the distance, around two metres from where she was.

Moments later, an explosion resounded, and a part of the settlement wall behind Erin was destroyed, jolting the entire underground settlement they were in.

"Another troublesome one who really isn't on my hit list!" Erin frowned as she started to move forward, but she did so in a zig-zag path.

This made it difficult for Borden to hit her, but he soon began throwing out fist after fist, creating large explosions in the ground that missed Erin.

"She seems faster than me, but only a bit, so I know exactly what to do!" Borden said, charging off for the first time.

His power was explosive, and since he timed it perfectly and was only going in a straight line, he had already reached Erin, grabbing her sword and pushing her back.

"You should be careful because something like this, I can break with my bare hands!" Borden said, but just as he was about to grab her sword, it started to freeze, and it was as if an ice-type attack was building.

Borden let go, but not before kicking her right in the stomach, sending her flying off. As she skidded off the ground, Erin started to spin, and during her spin, she replaced the sword with her katana blade that she had been looking for as soon as Laxmus's items began to pop out.

Whilst spinning, she fired little slashes of yellow aura in every direction but mainly consecrated the attack on Borden. He started to move his hands, hitting them away and reflecting the attacks towards the ground.

However, he couldn't avoid getting hurt and ended up with many minor cuts throughout his left side. Suddenly though, Erin had stopped and turned her head towards her right, away from Borden.

An electric fist came out of nowhere, but she whacked it away in the air with her bare hands. And, right before that, she had already gathered Qi in both hands and punched the attacker right in the stomach, she sent him back, hurt to the point that he had difficulty breathing.

"Ah, that hurts... how much Qi does she have? That attack went straight through my hardening ability!" Jake shouted while rubbing the side of his chest, feeling Erin's counterattack may have broken a few of his ribs.

Jake had thought he had come in at the perfect time, fast enough that she wouldn't notice him, but Jake was unaware of Erin's ability.

Even now, Erin had it active, overlooking everyone's energy from a bird's eye view. Surprise attacks never seemed to work on her because of this reason, and it was because of this she noticed two things.

"This is getting more annoying by the second. You... how has your energy increased." Erin asked, looking back at Borden, who had green blood gushing out of his wounds.

"You think I couldn't avoid your attack?" Borden replied. "I was getting hurt on purpose, I guess it's been too long for you to remember what exactly happens to us when we're hurt. By this time, Jake had recovered and was ready to attempt another attack, this time with a fellow Blade.

Just then, someone appeared behind Borden and in front of Layla.

"They say one shouldn't visit someone empty handed, so I give you this," Peter said, handing the Black Celestial Sword to Layla. As she grabbed it, she looked up, and her eyesight started to become even blurrier by the second.

"Peter... is it really you?... you're back?… you're back... I'm sorry that you had to see me like this." Layla's voice quivered, unable to control her emotions upon suddenly seeing another face of a long-lost friend.

"It's okay. You can tell me all about it later." Peter said as he dropped something heavy by his side. And it made quite the loud thud sound.

"Let me get rid of our problem first, and then we can talk," Peter said again while kneeling down and placing his hand on someone's body that had died not too long ago.

"Come on, you Bastard, WAKE THE F*CK UP AND FINISH YOUR JOB!"

***

# Chapter 1791: To hot to handle.

The others who had been around Peter for a while knew he was a Wight. They knew he was an undead creature, a subclass of the vampires. And they were also well aware that Wights could raise the dead and turn them into their loyal servants.

However, they didn't know that Peter was a bit special in that regard. Not only could he raise some types of undead that others couldn't, but he could also have two undead at once. But, unfortunately, he had lost his favourite two Lesser Wights, Hilston and legs, who came from a five-spiked Dalki, during the Great War a millennia ago.

And, with Peter having gained additional power, there wasn't really a necessity to have Lesser Wights. In the first place, he didn't want to use anyone that would be weaker than the last two he had. Otherwise, they would just get in his way or slow him down. But now, there was a good opportunity for him.

Peter put his hand against Laxmus' back. The latter's body was in good condition apart from a few holes and scratches here and there, but the most important thing was that he wasn't missing any limbs or anything that could make him any weaker.

In fact, he even had his wings out even after death, so Peter was hoping he had hit the jackpot. However, Peter didn't realise that he hadn't turned anyone into a Lesser Wight ever since he woke up from his slumber, not to mention that he had also received the celestial power from Quinn, which would surely affect his ability.

And sure enough, when the energy was leaving his body and going into Laxmus, Peter felt a tingling sensation like he had never felt before. Being a Wight had dulled Peter's senses, but right now, he felt as if he had thousands of spiders crawling down on the hand that he had put on Laxmus. And no doubt, the large figure that Erin had killed not long ago began to twitch and finally stood up.

"Hey... hey! What's going on? Didn't Laxmus just die? How did he suddenly stand up?" June asked. Her lips quivered, mainly out of fear. She wasn't alone. Most of the Vampires and Dhampirs at the scene didn't understand what was happening.

There were certain beings that A Wight could raise and others that could not. And someone as powerful as Laxmus would fall in the latter category, not to mention he was in his most powerful form. However, seeing him stand up like this, almost everyone on the battlefield found it hard to believe. After all, Laxmus was one of the peak existences in the known Solar Systems.

"Come on!" Peter shouted. "You can't rest yet. Finish the job you started!" He added, giving Laxmus a hefty slap on the back.

As he did, Laxmus opened his mouth wide, and at that moment, to everyone's surprise, a red aura started to gather in front of his mouth. It was the iconic move that Laxmus had used multiple times while fighting either Erin or Layla. It was the Blood breath.

And seconds later, the red beam was launched and headed straight towards Erin.

Usually, Peter's Lesser Wights could only use their physical power, and even that was affected somewhat, but Laxmus could still gather the red aura. Peter wasn't sure if this was due to the upgrade in his power because of the celestial energy. Nevertheless, he was satisfied that he now had a strong minion by his side.

On the other side, seeing the incoming attack, Erin stabbed her sword into the ground again, creating a giant ice barrier. It was one of the active skills to reflect the attacks from the enemy. However, it hadn't worked against Laxmus attacks for whatever reason. Either way, it had stopped the attack, although she had to put some of her Qi into the ice wall.

"Erin, you damn b*tch! This is for all those dirty looks you gave me in the past!" Peter shouted, throwing out a fist. Erin dodged the attack by moving her head, but Peter had quickly gone down to grab her shoulder and threw her straight to the ground.

"You're freaking trying to kill Quinn's wife?!" Peter shouted again, his whole body transforming into his celestial form. He now had his head-tail, and similar to Laxmus, a strange hardening black material covered his arms.

With Peter coming at her quickly, Erin pulled out the Katana blade she had just found.

-CLANG!

A loud clash resounded as she managed to deflect attacks back-to-back.

"Since when did Peter get this strong?... I knew he was always powering up, but how... and if he's here, does that mean... Quinn is as well?" Erin was surprised by her opponent's strength as she charged up her blade to let out a large Qi attack that pushed Peter's head-tail out of the way.

She then quickly took a step forward, bursting with power, ready to slash at Peter's stomach, but before she could, a kick came from her right and hit her right in the ribs, sending her off again.

"Did you forget this isn't a one-on-one fight?!" Borden shouted as he stepped into the fight as well.

And he was right because there was a certain Blade waiting for Erin for payback in the direction he had sent her.

As Erin's body flew through the air, Jake had created a hardened pillar of earth and extended it out. Then, using the pillar-like bat, he swung it and hit the incoming Erin. The hit sent the latter in another direction, and when she fell, Erin coughed up blood.

For the first time since she came here, Erin was injured.

"They're doing it," Hannah said with a smile. "They can defeat the Dhampir Queen!"

The people who were fighting against Erin certainly weren't just nobodies. They could have given Laxmus a run for his money, and now they were together against one opponent. Since Erin had already used her four kings to fight Laxmus, she couldn't use them again for some time because they were still recuperating from the previous fight.

"We can't relax. Guys, be on alert," Jessica said. "So far, the dhampirs haven't decided to get involved, but I can see them fidgeting. They're ready to jump in and fight at any second now." On the battlefield, Erin had twisted the handle of her Demon-tier sword while bearing through the pain and began spinning it around to create a vortex of flames around her. "I have already used up most of my Qi when fighting Laxmus, and now I have to not just fight him again but the others as well."

"It's not the real Laxmus, and I have achieved my objective... if I stay here, I will die, but if I leave, all of the dhampirs will most likely die."

Erin was conflicted, but in the end, she had made her choice.

"I have to go!" Finally, she made up her mind.

Erin stabbed her sword into the ground, and to make sure no one could get close to her, she formed a fire barrier. Although no one was close enough to reach her, Jack saw through her actions and instantly sprinted forward.

"This is a defensive move! You think I don't know you're trying to run away!" Jake shouted as he created lightning in his hand and thrust it forward. But at that moment, a giant sword had come between his attack.

Jack had never seen this sword before, and it didn't come from Erin. And as soon as Jake's lightning touched the sword, a massive explosion went off, creating smoke throughout the battlefield.

"Let's get out of here!" Someone shouted.

And when others turned towards the direction of the voice, they found it was from Erin's most trusted ally, the Dhampir Flora.

Behind her was a teleportation portal and in her hand was a huge sword. It wasn't just any sword, but the one which once belonged to a person named Arthur.

"Well, this trip has given us many rewards." Erin thought.

She instantly appeared by Flora's side and could sense several attacks coming her way. But Flora had already activated the teleporter for both of them to escape this place.

"Goodbye, all of you, but I promise this won't be the last time you see me. I will not stop until I have ridden this whole world of every single vampire."

"That is my promise, and I will make sure to pay back to everyone who got in my way today."

She projected her cry throughout the settlement using her Qi as the fire barrier descended.

When the dust settled, there was no one to be seen at the same spot. The Dhampir Queen had escaped.

***

# Chapter 1792: The Only Leader.

Out of frustration, Peter attacked the spot from where Erin had teleported. His head-tail continued to pound that spot and even created a crater. Seeing Erin escape right before his eyes had frustrated Peter more than anything. And the fact that she escaped so effortlessly was just putting salt on the wound.

In anger, it looked like Peter's new Lesser Wight, Laxmus, was doing the same. It was punching the ground like an angry gorilla and hitting it repeatedly as it imitated its new master.

The ground was easily shaking the whole nearby area.

"I don't know if it's just me... but I find it so weird to look at," Kev said.

"I mean, after how much we were afraid of Laxmus and the fact that everyone in the Red Vampires respected him, and now for him to end up like this, isn't it ironic?"

"He wanted to make the whole world bow, but now is nothing but a mere puppet."

Many Red Vampires at the scene felt the same way as well, and they had heard what Laxmus had said. Although they agreed with him on hatred for humans they didn't know his reasons which seemed petty more than anything. It was as if he felt being a vampire was a curse and because he had to deal with it, he wished everyone else did as well.

While most of the vampires that sided with him, did so because they thought they were superior. Which contradicted the two ways of thinking.

However, something strange was in the underground town-the Dhampirs that had come with Erin were still inside the settlement.

And through whatever means Erin had escaped, she hadn't revealed it to them.

The dhampirs soon realised their danger and were trying to leave from where they had come. However, by communicating with each other telepathically, the Vampires were one step ahead and had already blocked off any way of escaping.

The Red Vampires were not tired yet. This war had filled many with anger because they had lost a lot of their friends and even one of their leaders. Therefore, they didn't show any mercy to the escaping Dhampirs.

The battle resumed, and this time it was more of a one-sided massacre. Ni, seeing this herself, didn't know what to do since she was also part of the Dhampirs.

"I can help," Xander suddenly suggested, "My shadow power... I didn't get it from Laxmus. We had been designing contingency plans against him for a while, and the shadow was one of them."

Using his own shadow crystal that looked dimmer than the last time he took it out, he used the shadow to shroud Ni for now and decided to think about what to do with her later. However, it was too late for the rest of the dhampirs.

There was too much wrath, and bloodshed as the Red Vampires massacred the dhampirs without showing pity or mercy. By now, Peter had also calmed down and had stopped acting crazy.

The group decided to head to where he was standing. Everyone was curious about what had truly happened and what would be the next course of action.

However, as they did though, Xander noticed that Layla was wobbly on her feet.

"Layla!" He shouted and ran across the ground, grabbing onto her.

"Is she okay?" Shiro asked. He had just come from a tough fight against one of the Guardians. Although the Guardians lost their shadow, the fight became much easier, and Shiro defeated his opponent swiftly.

"I think so. She's just tired and will recover with good rest." Xander replied. He could hear her faint heartbeat and even sense her breathing slowly.

The battle between the Red Vampires and the dhampirs had ended by now. The Red Vampires were currently only a quarter of their size when the war began. Nevertheless, a little over 200 hundred Vampires had managed to survive.

However, of all the dhampirs that had attacked, only a handful had managed to escape.

Earlier, since Peter and his group had landed right in a war, they had taken care of most of the Guardians.

The group came to this planet with a heart of vengeance and had planned retribution for the Red Vampires for attacking the Green city, and if it was another day, they would have seen this plan through to the end, but this day was different.

Even though this group of newcomers had been attacking them moments ago, now that the dhampirs were defeated, the Red Vampires were on their knees, staring off into the distance, not knowing what to do now.

"I really don't know what to report back to Dad. Do we say we won this battle? Achieved our goal?" Jake asked.

"Well yeah, it's hard to judge what has happened," Muka replied, walking towards Jake.

"The Red Heart is no longer with Laxmus, who was our biggest fear."

"I don't think the Red Vampires will ever be the same threat as ever after this, and it looks like our other Leader was working as a double agent."

While saying this, Muka looked towards Layla, lying flat on the ground, relaxed.

"However, the Red Heart is in the hands of someone who sees the whole world as her enemy, and she is also the one who defeated Laxmus. This simply means we could be in for an even bigger mess."

Just then, Lucia, Jessica, and Minny came running back to the others, looking tired and out of breath.

"I'm sorry, but we couldn't find it anywhere," Jessica said.

"The sword that you were talking about. There were a few other weapons and a strange box and some larger stuff that we couldn't open but nothing that resembled the sword." A few minutes back, they were sent to find Arthur's sword. But after hearing what had happened, they knew it would be almost impossible to get it back because the sword was now in the hands of the vengeful Dhampir Queen.

And since she also had the Red Heart, the combination of the two could potentially be very dangerous.

*** *** ***

After the meeting ended, they began to focus on their own things, and Jake reported to Logan to update the latter about what had happened and how the mission went.

But that was when the Red Vampires started to do something as well. They began to gather in front of the wrecked Lab and headed towards where the others were.

However, they didn't get to close, only staying away for around twenty metres and waiting.

"Um... this is a bit strange, right? Should we do or say something?" Jake asked.

"Not yet," Xander stated, as he could tell that Layla was finally opening her eyes.

"Xander..." Layla said in a soft voice, smiling and rubbing her forehead again. "You're alive."

"Well, thank you for the vote of confidence. Did you really want me dead?" Xander asked.

Shaking her head and lifting herself slowly, she noticed Peter and the others, the destroyed settlement and more.

"I guess everything wasn't a dream in the end. Did Laxmus die? And what happened to Erin?" Layla slowly asked.

Xander then explained everything that had happened, even though he felt now wasn't the right time. He just wanted her to rest but knew she wouldn't give up until she had her answers.

"I see... I should thank everyone." Then, using the sword, she pushed herself off the ground, and Xander helped her. Quickly, both Kev and June went to her side, and she finally stood properly with her hands around their shoulders.

"Please, you really shouldn't walk," June pleaded.

Layla didn't respond because her thoughts were occupied by something else. Instead, she continued to stare into the eyes of everyone there. She didn't know why they were there, nor did she know who everyone was, but she knew one thing: they had all worked as hard as they could to stop Laxmus and Erin, and most importantly, they were on Quinn's side.

That was the critical factor that they all had.

"Thank you, everyone, thank you so much for helping me. No, not just for me, but for the whole vampire and human race from collapsing." Layla stated while bowing her head.

The group felt a bit embarrassed; some of them didn't know what to say. The red vampire leader, considered an enemy of the world, had given her apology. Confirming she really wasn't an enemy after all and was one of the good ones. It was mind scratching, but they somewhat knew this could be the case after learning the truth from Quinn.

"Quinn will be happy that you were helping him as well," Peter said.

"And hey, look what I got out of this whole thing. It might be a loss for everyone, but it's a plus for me." Peter smiled, patting the shoulder of the large Laxmus, who just grunted.

Just then, a particular vampire walked over to Layla and bowed down on the ground.

"My name is Hannah, captain of a small squad of the Red Vampires. I greet the Leader with great respect." Hannah said.

"Please... stand," Layla replied. "I was the leader of the Red Vampires, but."

Standing up immediately after hearing that, Hannah had a tear in her eyes.

"No, the Red Vampires are here still. We all fought for a cause, and you were one of our leaders. Still our Leader. Which is why I ask you, as there is still something you need to do."

Stepping to the side, Hannah presented her hand and gestured at the two hundred or so Red Vampires.

"Please, as the only leader of the Red Vampires, look after us, and guide us on what to do!" Hannah bowed again, and following her words, the rest of the vampires did as well.

***

# Chapter 1793: Red Continue On.

This was not the first time Layla was seeing all the Red Vampires gathered in front of her. As one of the leaders of the red vampires, there had been multiple occasions when they stood in front of her. In fact, the numbers for previous events were far more than this time.

However, for some reason, seeing them this way this time felt different. Was it because before, she had always stood in front of them as a fake leader? The respect, honour and awe, all felt fake, and to a certain degree, she thought it was the same now.

"They're waiting for me. They want me to say something." Layla thought.

After taking a long breath, Layla gently brushed Kev and June, who were helping her balance. And as the two of them stepped back, she stood straight and stepped forward. She couldn't look weak in a moment like this, not with what she was about to say.

And finally, when she was around ten metres away from them, her steps came to a halt.

"The Red Vampire Leader Laxmus is dead, and the Queen of the Dhampirs killed him, but I am not here to tell you that. It's a fact that you already know."

"And I am sure many of you must have seen that moments before the Dhampir attack, Laxmus and I were fighting each other."

"So before you call me your leader or wish for me to lead you, you all deserve to know the truth." Layla said, inhaling a deep breath.

All the vampires were hanging to her every word, and she had their full attention.

"The truth is Laxmus was using you all. There was a much larger force in control of what Laxmus was doing. And he would gather anyone under that banner to achieve his goal. I'm sure many of you had heard what he said in his final moments.

"The Red Heart, although he might have planned to use it to eliminate humans. Sooner or later, his attention would have turned on all of you as the one controlling him dictated what he did."

"I knew this, which was why I joined the Red Vampires. But that doesn't mean my feelings towards you all for these years have been fake. On the contrary, I wish to protect everyone and give you the life you deserve because I am a faithful follower of the Great Hero Quinn."

"I believe he would have wanted the best for you, and I continue to follow his wishes and strive to make his dream a reality, which is why I want to continue doing that."

"I don't plan to turn the humans into vampires or control them as Laxmus wanted. Instead, I plan to create a safe place for vampires like us."

"I know many of you don't feel safe around humans, and you have every reason to. I have heard your stories, and I have listened to you."

"So I won't force you to live with them, but just like in the old settlement, you will have the choice not to get involved with them."

"I'm tired of fighting, and I'm tired of losing people I care about. So let's just tend to each other from now. If you guys agree with me and believe in that. then feel free to follow me."

Once Layla's brief speech ended, something strange happened that the Red Vampires themselves didn't understand. Many of them had started to cry, and their eyelashes turned moist. A wave of emotion hit them as if they felt free, free from their duties, free from everything they had been toiling for years.

If they followed Layla, they felt like they could finally live the life they had strived for, and after an emotional turmoil, they could express their feelings more easily.

"Thank you!" Hannah cried, "Thank you for not abandoning us. Thank you for not just leaving us and forgetting about us... LEADER!"

The last word resounded throughout the area. And hearing her, the rest of the Red Vampires also followed and clamoured in unison.

"LEADER!"

The others witnessed history in the making for the Red Vampires, and they couldn't help but feel warm inside after seeing this scene. The vampires were patting each other and hugging with tears of joy.

As another favour to them, Layla was removing the fog above their heads and consuming it all-letting them feel happiness and forget about the bad that had transpired.

"I will take on your pain in return for trusting me," Layla thought.

While all this was happening, Jake whispered something to Shiro, who was by his side, and the two nodded after they agreed on something.

Once the clamour calmed down, they walked to the front.

"We are partly to blame for this mess here," Jake stated. "Which is why the two of us have decided to do something. Just remember that I, a human from Green city, have decided to do all of you a favour."

Shiro sighed a little, he thought the last bit was unnecessary, but the two of them placed their hands on the ground anyway. A few seconds later, large buildings just like before started to rise from the ground.

Section by section, several buildings rose and were created within seconds right in front of the stunned Red Vampires, and finally, in the place of the lab, Jake decided to place a mansion instead. In front of it was a garden, and through it was a pathway leading to the front door.

The two of them were done, and Jake clapped his hands as if he were pleased with the results.

"It's not as strong as the buildings before, but it's at least a start and something you can live in for now." Jake said.

The vampires were impressed as they looked inside the buildings, but they soon noticed something.

"Hey, human, we have no furniture! The battle destroyed them as well. Do you think you can also build some of that from your earth ability?"

"Yeah, for me as well. A nice large cabinet would be nice, and can you make my room a bit bigger? I mean, there's less of us now, so we can have bigger houses and rooms, right?"

Soon, several vampires were making requests, and sweat ran down Jake's face.

"Well, go on. You want them to see you in a good light, right? So you should finish what you started." Shiro gestured to the other.

Sulking, Jake walked toward the vampires with heavy feet.

"Do you know how excited I'm going to be after this? I was hoping to go to the nice mansion I designed..." Jack mumbled but listened to his uncle in the end.

The group laughed and thought it would be best to head inside Layla's new home for a little bit to discuss the next steps.

"Everyone, please have a well-deserved rest. Then, once everyone has recovered, we will gather the fallen and pay our respects to them."

"Whether they agreed or disagreed with us, or even if they fought by our side because it's due to them that some of us are alive today."

Saying these words, the vampires felt like they had a little breath of energy and decided to do as Layla told them.

"Ah, Minny is tired as well." Minny yawned while getting a piggyback ride from Jessica. "Minny worked hard. Everyone worked hard as well to be my mommy." Minny finally shut her eyes.

"It looks like you are all an interesting group. I'm surprised you took such a young vampire onto the battlefield." Layla said, still being helped by the other two.

"Hey, Dad, can you like, come over here and give us a hand or something" June asked.

"Ah, right, sorry" Xander quickly rushed over to their side.

"They're your kids, Xander?" Peter asked. "Right, you told me they were, but... does that mean Layla is their mother?"

Then he looked at Layla, and an incredulous expression appeared on his face, "Wait, did you two have kids! What about Quinn?! I thought you and him were like dating!"

***

# Chapter 1794: Troubled Queen.

It was a tense moment for the group for multiple reasons. First, they had heard Quinn talk about Layla before. When talking about her, it did sound like the two had some connection, but to hear directly from Peter that the two of them were dating meant it went a lot further than they thought.

"Wait a second.. those three are acting pretty close." Jessica thought. "Quinn was in slumber for a thousand years while Layla was running the Red Vampires. It would make sense for her to move on and find someone else, and these guys are incredibly close to her."

"That means I might be able to sweep in when he has a broken heart, show how caring and loyal I am, and then with Minny on my side and all the juice boxes I have prepared, Quinn and I can, we can…"

"These are not my kids," Layla answered. These four words crushed Jessica's hopes, and a few other faces reacted for a split second, but not many managed to catch it, as they quickly put on a brave face.

"That's right. She's our auntie." June replied as they continued to help.

"I'll answer your questions once we get inside," Layla said.

Upon entering the mansion, the first observation everyone had upon stepping inside was, "It's huge!"

It was a luxury mansion with a large double staircase leading to the second floor and even had specific pieces of furniture carved out, all made from Earth. It looked a little strange because it was all one colour, but the others could imagine what it would look like when everything was fully furnished.

Walking around, they all eventually found a large room to sit in, and Ashley, who was a bit embarrassed to be with everyone, had decided to head over to where Xander, Layla and the others were. He didn't feel comfortable around others because of his former identity.

"Oh, it's a surprise to see you here." Xander smiled, "Don't worry, I'm only teasing you. I heard from June and Kev what you were doing in front of the lab."

"I know it must have been hard for you, but you know. even though you were an arse sometimes, I always liked you."

Ashley didn't know what to say, so in the end, he just lowered his head and didn't say anything.

Layla sat down in one of what she could only assume was the living area due to the things that looked like sofas and a table in the middle. There were no cushions though, but it would have to do.

"I'm really interested to know about you all, and how you came to travel with Peter, and Peter how you are even here."

"It's been a long time, all of us doing our own thing, but I guess I should explain myself first." Layla said, adjusting her position a little.

"First, about your question from earlier, these kids belong to Xander, and they are a lot older than they look, a few hundred years old in fact. Unfortunately, their mother, Amy, has passed away."

"During that time, they were still young, so I helped Xander look after them, which is why they refer to me as their aunt." Layla smiled and rubbed Kev's hair.

He seemed to enjoy it but was also a bit embarrassed about it.

"When the Cursed faction was going through troubles, everyone had agreed to split and go their own way."

"Xander had decided to follow me at the time, but there was something that I had hidden from everybody, and it was this sword."

"When I used it during the fight against Helen and a few more times after, the sword started to affect me."

“Even when I wasn't using the sword, I could hear screams in my head as if they were trying to torture me. I tried to hold them back, but in the end they took over me."

"And because of this, there is a blank space in my memory. However, during all those years, Xander stayed with me."

"At some point, I had woken up from this daze to find out that ten years had passed, and next to me was Laxmus."

"It was then that I found out that the sword, and Laxmus, were linked to the same god, the god that created vampires in the first place."

"He's called Immortui. During that time, I stayed with Laxmus, and we founded the Red Vampires group."

"Laxmus saw me as an ally because we had the same marking, and I decided to take advantage of that. But in those years, I also helped the Red Vampires."

"Unfortunately, there were times when I found cruel things humans were doing to vampires, and I lost my way at times."

"Enough to even use powers which I never wanted to use." Saying these words, Layla stared at her hand and felt a pain in her chest simultaneously. The others didn't know what she meant by that, and although they wanted to ask, it didn't seem appropriate.

"Anyway, I'm happy Xander stayed with me. If you're wondering how he's still here, as well as Ashley, that's thanks to the shadow powers they have gained."

"Not only do they have the power to stop and slow attacks, but it seems like it slows down the ageing process of those who use this ability."

"Even if it's in a crystal, there is a way one can use it to slow down their own body's time, and they can live an extraordinarily long life."

That was when Xander pulled out the crystal.

"Well, maybe not so much anymore. The shadow belonged to Laxmus, and I stored it in a separate crystal from the one he gave us, but now that he's dead, there won't be a chance to refill the energy."

"Also, unlike MC cells, the shadow will not regenerate and can only be stored up to a certain quantity in the crystal. So, the more we use it, the faster it will deplete. Eventually, there will be no shadow left…"

Although it sounded like an unfortunate end to the tale, the expression on Xander's face told a different story. There was a smile on his face, and honestly, it was because he lived quite a painful life, but he never shared and would never reveal his thoughts and emotional pain to anyone.

Amy was his wife, and he loved her dearly, but after her demise, the old flame he had for Layla reignited, especially whenever he saw her with his kids. As they spent more time together, his feelings matured, but he knew her mind was always on one person, and she would wait forever for him.

To be with the person he loved and to be by her side all this time to support her while knowing she liked someone else was heart-wrenchingly painful, yet he chose to go through it. He was happy that she was happy and that his kids could now live a life with motherly care, but he was also a bit tired. Thinking about this, he inwardly sighed and was thankful that no one else had noticed his sudden mood change, although he could just blame it on the shadow problem if someone asked.

On the other hand, after Layla had explained herself to the others, the group started to talk about their experiences and the events that transpired in the last few days.

Peter started the discussion and talked about how he found himself in the room one day, and after an unknown time, Quinn also woke up, and from that room, their new adventure began. Next was Jessica, and then Lucia, too, talked about her side of the story.

After some time, Layla finally had a clear picture of what happened, how things worked out, and who all these people were.

In the end, Layla sat there in silence while thinking about Quinn.

"So… no one knows where Quinn is right now?" She finally asked.

Everyone looked a bit depressed by this fact, but it was a truth they had to accept.

"Well, at least I know he is alive. And there is a good chance that I will see him again. But, for now, I guess we just have to do what we can and carry on as we have for all these years." Layla smiled.

"About that." Shiro opened his mouth, but he had switched with Vorden.

"We need to talk about the elephant in the room. I know we have been avoiding It all this time, but what has happened to Erin? Why is she so hell-bent on thinking that everyone is her enemy?"

"Layla, you were close to her and were also part of the Red Vampire later, and the dhampirs seemed to have a huge grudge against the Red Vampires. Is there a reason for that? Do you know something?" Vorden asked.

"I want to know too!" Lucia sighed, "I mean, she had the turtle familiar. Does that mean she killed our leader, Owen? I thought he had died of natural causes."

"We also learnt that the Dhampirs can control their natural urges," Peter added. "Does that mean Erin is doing this out of her own will?"

"I'm not sure, but I think I might know someone who can answer these questions," Layla replied.

***

# Chapter 1795: Wake him up.

There was a reason why no one quite knew what happened to Erin, and that was simply because Erin had blocked all contacts without any explanation. Based on what Leo had told them, they knew she was a Dhampir and had trouble controlling herself, but that was it.

Shortly, she returned, saving some of their lives during a crucial moment in the war against the Dalki, only to turn and kill the first vampire leader. But there was something that everyone was pretty sure about.

She was the reason for the uprising of Dhampirs and the reason behind the rift between the two groups. How it started though, was something hardly anyone had an answer to.

"As I said, I don't know the answers to the question you have, and for that, I have to apologise," Layla stated.

"The thing is, it's clear that it's Erin's anger, not the urge that's behind her actions. It's as if she genuinely hates vampires, which makes no sense."

"When I think about it more and more, it reminds me of the old Erin?"

"The old Erin?" Lucia asked.

"Ah!" Vorden said, realising and tapping the side of his head as he figured out how to explain. "I guess you are not aware of it, but Erin isn't just the queen of the dhampirs to us, but she is actually an old friend."

"You see, we had a group, me, Layla, Peter, Quinn, and Logan, from time to time. We were all classmates at the same military school. Which is why this whole fight is too personal for us." Vorden explained.

When the others heard of this, they couldn't even be surprised anymore. After every fact they learned about Quinn, they would be left speechless. And now Vorden was basically saying everyone who had worked with Quinn had become some giant influential figure, good or bad.

Leader of the Red Vampires, Queen of the Dhampirs, Leader of Earth, and even a high-ranking person in the Blade family. Although, they couldn't understand why the fact that Erin was part of Quinn's group had never gotten out.

"Haha, and you're forgetting that Quinn was the one that turned Erin into what she is," Peter added. "So in a way, this is all Quinn's fault."

Even if it were somewhat true, no one would say it. At least they wouldn't word it in the same way Peter had expressed just now.

"Anyway, I have a theory," Layla said, interrupting the awkwardness.

"There are only two events I can think of that could have massively influenced Erin's mentality. One of them is the disappearance of Quinn."

"However, even then, she seemed sane enough to leave for fear that she could hurt us. Then the only thing I can think of, which might have affected her drastically, is Leo's death."

Leo was influential not just in Quinn's life but also played a big part in Erin's life. He was her mentor and teacher and even helped her through all her troubles. Because of this, the others understood the importance of Leo in Erin's life and somewhat agreed that his death could have been a trigger.

"But what happened to Leo?" Peter asked. "Quinn tried to find out around. We know it happened while they were fighting against Pure, but when Quinn fought with Chris, he said that Leo died before him, although he wasn't the one who did it."

"In fact, from the sound of things, it sounded like Erin was the one that killed Leo."

Layla sighed and tried to understand the situation.

"The whole thing doesn't make sense. Erin is strong, strong enough to find a way to get rid of the dhampir urge, yet she was the one that killed Leo?"

"Her hatred for vampires had a turning point, and I can only assume it has something to do with Leo. The anger she is feeling and how she acted was similar to how the old Erin used to react whenever she came across any Dalki."

"Could it be that a vampire killed this Leo guy?" Jessica suggested. This was also a good possibility and could validate the reason behind Erin's hate against Vampires.

"Maybe. We can't say for sure, but there is someone who might know the answer to all our questions." Layla replied.

"Who? Pure?" Vorden asked. "I mean, Chris was there. We could ask him what happened that day if he doesn't attack us the moment we step in front of him."

"Not. Don't forget that Leo didn't attack Pure alone. He was with someone else at the time, this guy, Sera."

"That guy could raise the levels of any weapon to the demon-tier level. He is the person I am talking about."

Now that Layla mentioned it, Peter and Vorden started to recall him as well. Although Vorden wasn't directly there at the time, he had heard about Sera.

"Ah yes, I remember him. He was indeed very powerful." Muka also remembered the person in question.

"In fact, I would find it hard if there were many that could take him on back then. Maybe one could now, but it was a different story back then."

"Anyway, I am sure he must have survived the war. And perhaps even travelled with Leo for a bit, helping him take care of Pure."

"But the question is, is he still alive? Isn't he human? He would have died long ago, even with Qi."

Layla shook her head once again and raised her sword.

"The sword told me that Sera wasn't a normal human. He is similar to Laxmus but not quite the same. He should still be alive, but I have no clue how we can find him, nor do I have any leads."

The group thought about it for a while and discussed it as they tried to rack their brains. Now that Erin had the Red Heart, and based on her words, she would soon be moving out against the other vampires. Maybe even targeting the Vampire Corps next.

"I just realised something, Layla. Why are we trying so hard to find out what happened to Erin?" Peter asked.

"Do you still see her as your friend? Because either way, if we fight her again, we will have to use everything at our disposal to have a chance of winning a fight against her, unless you guys want to end up like Laxmus and be by my side."

It was true because the simple solution was to kill Erin and take the Red Heart back to stop her and the Dhampirs from accomplishing their goal, and only then can they try to make peace between the humans and vampires again.

"Even if you turn Erin normal again like she was before, that doesn't change what she's done either," Vorden added. "The Dhampirs have killed many people, including Fex's wife, Samantha."

"I know," Layla said, clenching her fist. "But we must know what happened to stop it from repeating to us and others around us. After finding out about these Celestials, it just makes me feel that something bigger is happening, and they're all trying to use us.

"I don't want to lose any more people, and before I decide to pass on, I want to know what happened to Erin. I don't want to pass away with regret, not after living this long."

Many understood what Layla was saying because they had felt the same way.

"Although I'm not sure if he will know about Sera or not because he is a human, there is one genius that might be able to figure out how we can locate him."

"Or how we can perhaps get Quinn back with us as well." Xander chimed in, holding up the crystal in his hand.

"Well, take Vincent back to Logan, see if he can get the former back to how he was, and maybe Vincent would have a better idea for what we have to do next."

"After all, he stayed in hiding for a very long time, and I bet he might know a few facts that we're unaware of."

***

# Chapter 1796: Human vs Human!

Once they decided what to do next, everyone stood up. The group that had initially come to invade the red base would now return to Green city to revive Vincent.

Xander would also be joining the group since he had the crystal and was the only one who knew how to use it.

On the other hand, Layla would be staying behind, and although she felt that she needed her friend here on the base to handle the affairs, in the end, she relented since she still had June, Kev, and Ashley to help her. As for her going with the group, that was a ridiculous idea since her people needed to stay here with them, especially in this challenging time. On top of that, Hannah had also decided to stay with Layla.

She said that she felt a little uncomfortable with the group, and since she was a follower of Layla, she wanted to stay that way as well. But, of course, if Quinn wanted to take back the powers he had given her, she would be okay with that as well.

However, the others thought it was unlikely, considering who Hannah had decided to help.

At the same time, Shiro and Vorden decided to return to the Blade ship. They were comfortable to help anytime if the group called them back, and after seeing Erin, they felt their old friends would need their help soon to deal with her.

In the end, a communication line was also opened, so they could come for help at any point and time.

While preparations were being made, and before they went off, there were a few things the others wanted to check out. So, stepping out of the mansion, they started to explore the vampire settlement.

"So, what are we exactly looking for again?" Jessica asked.

The large group divided themselves into parts, and Jessica, Lucy and Minny were in the same group.

"Just anything that looks of value or doesn't really match up in the vampire settlement," Lucia explained.

"When Laxmus died, apparently his shadow released many items all over the place. Some of the stuff looked good, and maybe we can learn what Laxmus did during his time alive."

After some hours of searching, the group mostly found useless stuff, although they all found some handy weapons too. However, none of them could compare to Arthur's sword. Honestly, it turned out to be quite a disappointing lot.

However, there was one large object the girls had come across. It was larger than a coffin in size while being round. It was something neither of them had seen before.

"This seems quite heavy," Lucia said nervously.

The two girls ended up taking their findings back, and Minny jumped on the large object, not making it any easier for the girls. Eventually, they reached the mansion, where all the other search groups had also returned.

Minny jumped off happily to join the others.

"Minny would have helped, but my arms are too small," Minny said, imitating picking up the object. "Look, I can't reach."

The others found Minny's actions quite cute, but Lucia and Jessica, who had lugged the strange contraption halfway across the settlement, weren't really in the best of moods to swoon over this little girl.

In fact, seeing Minny from behind, Jessica had a split thought of just kicking her.

"Be nice… remember the game plan, Jessica. You have to stick to the game plan." She thought, putting on a fake smile.

"What do you think this is? And why did Laxmus keep it in his shadow." Lucia asked.

The vampires at the scene looked at each other, especially Xander and Layla. Then, to confirm his suspicion, Xander went to have a closer look brushing his hand against it and even rolled the object to find its top.

"Yep, it really is what I thought it was," Xander said.

"It's an Eternal chamber. These things were what used to go underneath the vampire castles. In simple words, this is what the leaders used to go into for an internal slumber."

Leaders were not the only ones who went into eternal slumber, but there were specific chambers that would be buried underground just for the thirteen vampire leaders, and this was without a doubt one of their chambers.

"We didn't find anything like that," Mitchell stated. "It must be the only one, but why would Laxmus have that chamber? Do you know which family it belongs to?"

Xander shook his head.

"There is only one way to find out, and that's using blood from the same family because it's the only way to open these things."

"So I guess we could just try everyone here? I am sure we have vampires from all the old thirteen families bloodlines."

Every vampire at the scene dropped a droplet of their blood onto the chamber, but there was no reaction. Still intrigued at why Laxmus would have such a thing, they decided to ask for the rest of the Red vampires to test their blood as well.

It was a long shot, especially since it's been so long, and the bloodlines were diluted and mixed, but they also thought this might increase their chances. In the end, however, not a single vampire's blood worked.

"There has to be a reason why Laxmus kept this on him. Maybe it was one of the original vampires? One of the others?" Xander pondered.

"At least it clears up one thing," Muka said. "Laxmus wasn't behind the disappearance of all the other chambers. He was one of my suspects in attacking the vampire settlement and destroying them."

"But I doubt he would only have one on him. Maybe he was trying to collect the other leaders and originals as well?"

"Anyway, this leaves Bliss and Pure as my main two suspects."

Pulling out his crystal, Xander decided that for now, he would place it in his shadow space. Since none of the vampires here could activate it, it was a waste to let it remain here. However, storing the chamber did put his shadow powers to the limit, and it was unlikely he could keep anything else in the crystal.

Still, there was Logan as well, who had samples of blood in his lab, and they were hoping that maybe one of the samples might break the seal.

"You know opening things like this isn't always a good thing to do," Jessica suddenly said.

"I mean, if Laxmus had it, maybe it's someone as dangerous as Laxmus inside this chamber? Maybe I am wrong, but I believe it's good that we couldn't open it."

Upon hearing this, the others realised her assumption also had some backing. It was quite possible after opening the casket could have led them into another battle. And all of them knew they were not ready for one, especially not in the Red Vampire base.

Once the group inspected other items and didn't find anything else interesting, they began to bid their farewell. Jake had also returned after helping the vampires with their furniture and other requests, looking exhausted. His eyeballs were sinking in, and he was about to fall over.

"Update me on everything I missed once we get home," He said, too tired to care about what happened.

Soon, the group exited the Red Vampire Base and returned to the ship. It didn't take long for them to begin their return journey toward Green City, hoping to revive Vincent and find answers about either Erin or Quinn.

*** *** ***

In a dark room, someone was seated with his legs crossed. Just then, a marking of a single eye with two wings lit up on the said person's head. It pulsed a few times and eventually faded away.

"Poor Laxmus. It looks like he had failed to achieve what Immortui wanted. However, he was always too greedy."

"He cared for himself far too much and strayed from the original goal. It looks like I'm the last one left."

The man thought as he stood up and gripped the sword next to him firmly.

"Who would have thought that the last of your loyal servants alive would be a human. I guess it's a bitter-sweet ending. Now a human will kill all the other humans."

***

# Chapter 1797: A true Hatred.

A portal has opened in the vast hot desert. The use of portals was banned a long time ago due to a law that Logan Green imposed, and other planets and leaders agreed with it, but the technology was never lost and many still continued to use it illegally without fear of getting into trouble.

Similarly, for the ones currently using this portal, it didn't really matter to them. Two figures, holding hands, were thrown out of the portal. They were thrown with great force and started to roll across the desert until one of them stood upright and pulled the other up.

"Are you okay?" Erin asked while brushing off the sand on her clothes. The armour she was wearing had now disappeared and she was in her normal attire.

"Yeah, I'm fine. My body's just a bit hurt." Flora replied while picking up the sword for the ground she had used not too long ago, but her fingers failed her when she tried to grip its hilt.

On closer inspection, Erin noticed how much of a mess Flora was in. Her entire body was bruised, and one of her arms was even twisted and broken.

Sensing her energy, Erin could tell it was feeble, and Flora had even made a large cut on her arm to power the sword. It was surprising how she was still standing. Erin was aware that her closest subordinate could fall over any moment if she didn't get help.

"I have to thank you. Because of you, I could get myself out of a tricky situation. I'll be honest, I didn't think I would have survived that one. So let me help you." Erin put her hand on Flora's broken shoulder bone.

As Erin transferred Qi energy to Flora, it allowed the latter to heal more easily or speed up the healing process.

"Please, if you weren't here in the first place, we could have never reached this far." Flora shook her head.

After she absorbed some Qi, Flora purposely pulled away, not wanting to take too much of Erin's energy because it was clear to her as well that Erin was extremely tired, in fact, the most she had ever seen, but due to Erin's pride, she would never show weakness in front of others, especially to her followers.

"Who did this to you?" Erin asked as they began walking.

"You're strong, so I can't imagine many who could have troubled you, but then again, a few unexpected faces did turn up near the end."

"It was the undead one. The same one from the wedding. His strength and speed were already beyond mine, but then it seemed like he had this strange energy, the same type the Red Vampires used to help them transform."

"After that, he had powered up, and there was nothing I could do. Luckily, he wasn't the brightest person and was easily distracted, allowing me to get away."

"Who were those people? I'm not sure if they were with the Red Vampires or not?"

When talking about Peter, Flora's body was trembling a little. It had been the first time she had been so overwhelmed like that. Not even the Vampire Corps leader, Andy, was that strong.

"Ah yes, him... he showed potential in the past, and it looks like he's somehow able to become quite powerful."

"Who would have imagined the weakest in the entire academy would reach this level." Erin replied.

For a second, Flora wasn't sure if she was hallucinating, but it looked as if Erin was smiling as if she was proud of this fact, and the way Erin was speaking, it was as if she knew the attacker.

Flora thought for a moment and then began to follow her leader.

Her teleporter was an emergency measure, but there was actually nothing here for them. They landed on Earth itself but they were dropped at a random location, and once they got their bearings or reached somewhere, they could head back or plan according to the situation.

As they travelled through the seemingly endless desert, Erin's previous reaction was bugging Flora, and in the end, she couldn't control herself and asked the questions.

"Erin... I don't know if this is too personal and forgive me if it is, since I know you don't like to talk about your past much."

"But that undead, do you know him? And what about the others? Are you familiar with them as well?" Flora asked.

Erin's steps halted for a moment, and Flora wondered if she would face the former's wrath once Lin turned around.

"Yes, I knew him, but that was my life before I was who I am now, and even he was different in the past."

"This was before the world even knew of Vampires. It's been a long time since then, so it would be hard to imagine." Erin explained.

"A world without vampires..." Flora repeated, imagining what that would be like. Of course, vampires existed, but they had just stayed in hiding, but for Flora and nearly everyone alive today, vampires had become a norm, and it wouldn't be hard to encounter one.

"You don't have to worry." Erin continued.

Even if I know them, or whoever I face, I will never lose sight of the goal. I have lost too many people because of these vampires, and I know it is the same for you."

"Your situation reminded me of my own, which was why I decided to turn you, like me. I knew you wanted to change how the world was, how tolerant and helpless everyone was due to the vampires."

"And all because of what? Just because a vampire saved the world a thousand years ago. The funny thing is, this vampire hasn't even shown up since then."

Just because one of them has done a little good doesn't mean that we can forgive all the evil they Have all committed and continue to do.

As always, Erin got heated when it was a conversation about Vampires, but at least Flora could talk to her about the past. This was the first time this was happening because she would never answer these types of questions before.

The walk was tiring, and since they didn't know what they would face or who they would come across, going all out to run across the desert wasn't the best option, and for now, their bodies were recovering the Qi that they had lost in the war.

"What is the plan for now?" Flora eventually asked. "The dhampirs, since we left them, it's unlikely any one of them would survive."

"A bulk of our forces were taken out before we even reached the settlement by that other leader, and now with the rest of them gone, there are only a few units of Dhampirs scattered here and there."

"After they find out that we abandoned the main group like that, it might be difficult to convince and rally them up again for the cause."

Erin remained silent for some time before finally giving a response. "There are only two large factions of vampires that must be dealt with," She answered.

"The Red Vampires, who, after Laxmus's death, will struggle and crumble by themselves, and the Vampire Corps."

"Without these two, the vampires will cease to exist, but there is one problem. The Vampire Corps gets a lot of support from the Green family, but lately, a certain group has been able to turn the tide in support."

"During that battle, Jake Green was present. With this information, there is a lot that we can do. However, building up the dhampir forces again for another fight against the Vampire Corps and the Greens would take too long, so we need to use someone else's army to fight for or with us."

Finally, the two of them saw the endless sea and a small port town on the shore. A wall was built around it, and there seemed to be many travelers and other people.

"There's no Vampire Corps base, and you see the city flag in support of Pure. It looks like luck is still on our side. Let's meet with Pure and get rid of all these vampires.

"They will all pay for what they did to me and others, whose lives they ruined. I will not forget that day… I will never forget that day." Erin gritted her teeth.

***

# Chapter 1798: In the casket.

Since the group was heading back to Green city, it didn't take them long to reach their destination. It was mainly because the Red Vampire base was located on Earth, and they no longer had to remain in their stealth mode compared to before.

Another thing was that they no longer had Hannah with them, nor did they need to take a detour for the Blades. On their way back, the group had updated Logan on everything they knew so far. Logan reassured everyone and told them to leave it with him and ended the call shortly as if something else was bothering him. Either way, they would find out when they got back.

*** *** ***

Entering the Green city was never going to be a hurdle for them, and currently, everyone was in Logan's lab for a few reasons. First, they gave the casket they found among Laxmus' shadow items to Logan to analyse, and then they handed over Vincent, along with Xander's Nest crystal.

Logan placed him in a big tube, with the nest crystal attached to a chest device positioned around Vincent. The scene reminded Peter a lot of when Quinn was in slumber, and with Vincent having a face that matched Quinn's, it didn't exactly help subdue old memories.

"Will Vincent be okay?" Xander asked as Logan wiped the sweat from his head.

"I honestly can't give you a definite answer for now," Logan replied.

"He's in a similar state to Quinn. The nest Crystal isn't properly absorbing into Vincent's body, but it still is absorbing, which is the good news."

"Let's just hope it doesn't take 1000 years for Vincent to wake up like Quinn," Peter said, leaning up against the wall. He was frustrated with the whole situation, honestly. The fact that Quinn was nowhere to be found was bugging him even more. He wanted to find Quinn as soon as possible.

As for Logan, there looked to be something significant on his mind as well. Each time he looked at Jake, there was a large frown on his head, and he had chosen to hide behind Jessica, avoiding his father's gaze.

"Come on, dad, tell me what did I do wrong?" Jake finally said.

"I helped them as you asked, and there were loads of things you didn't tell me about them, like how crazy some of these people are."

"Crazy?" Jessica said, turning around she moved away so Jake and Logan could make eye contact.

"I told you to stay low," Logan replied. "It was the reason why you were hiding your face."

"Yeah, and I was wearing it the whole time, just like you asked!" Jake replied.

"What's the point of keeping on the hood if you go and display multiple and a different set of abilities?"

"Sure there were other Blades there, and if they were found attacking, it wouldn't be so much of a problem, but you're my son."

"The son of the current leader and known to be one of Green's Strongest forces. Pure can easily use this against us if they find out. Are you sure that you managed to hide well?"

This was a question Jake wasn't too sure about. The hood didn't cover his face, and at the time, he was trying hard to help the others take out Erin. In the end, he was sure that she had at least seen his face.

Seeing his son remain silent, Logan feared the worst but let out a big sigh after he thought about it. What could he do? Shouting wasn't going to change anything.

"We will just have to deal with it, and as you said, without you, there could be a chance that some people could have died."

"We should look at the bright side, and since I've heard nothing so far, it has to be good news." Logan stated.

Logan also believed that the Red heart being in the dhampirs' hands wasn't such a bad thing. Laxmus would have used the power for the destruction of all of the humans in some way or the other. As for Erin, other than its raw power, it was unlikely that she could have any other use for it.

It was certainly an item that one couldn't really use against vampires, and as far as he knew, the dhampires didn't have a great mind. It was the problem Laxmus had as well.

They could use it because the Red Heart was incapacitated. Logan currently only knew three people that could get the full use out of the Red Heart. Himself, Vincent and lastly, Agent four from Pure.

"As long as it doesn't somehow end up in Pure's hands, we should be okay. That's one less thing to worry about." Logan said as he moved on to the next project the others had bought. The large chamber casket that had someone inside.

Several robot arms were holding up the object while others were scanning it. Images flickered through Logan's computer as it was trying to find something. Words such as blood samples were being brought up, while references were coming up as well.

At the same time, fingerprints on it were taken, as well as DNA over the whole box to try and see who had been in contact with it as well, until finally, Logan had come up with an answer.

"Just as you all thought, that certainly is an Eternal Chamber originally created for the vampire leaders, kings and originals," Logan explained.

"After going through blood samples and DNA, I have pinpointed our most likely suspect as to who could be inside this."

"It seems like the most likely cause is Alex... Alex Way."

Muka's eyes opened up wide a bit when hearing this name. She had suspected it to be one of the other leaders, but for it to be the Blood Fairy?

"Should we open it?" Muka asked with hesitancy in her voice.

"I mean, you said before that there were many people after Alex due to the weapons he could create and honestly, a blood fairy might do us more harm than good."

"A blood fairy... there's a blood fairy inside that thing?" Jessica repeated. "What is a blood fairy? It sounds beautiful?" Minny asked.

The robots stopped scanning the device as Logan finally sat down, tired from everything he had been doing. Although his body was mostly robotic, his mind was still fully human.

"Even if we wanted to open it, we don't have any other way." Logan replied.

"I gave Alex's blood to Quinn. As they say, all roads lead back to him. And I'm sure it will be a nice surprise for him when he does come back."

Hearing Quinn's name just seemed to depress the group a bit, and now they were lost again, with no lead. Besides that, there was Erin too. Although they knew Sera might know a bit about what had happened to Erin and the reason behind her change of behaviour.

Looking at all the glum faces in the room and realising that he would have to stay with these people like this for a while, Logan stood up and clapped, grabbing everyone's attention.

"Okay, listen up. Learning and finding Erin is still essential, and the Red Heart can still be helpful to us in many ways."

"We might even use it to find Quinn. So instead of sitting around here, I have a suggestion to make to you all."

"There are people who have confronted Sera, and at the same time, keep in mind that Sera wasn't the only one there."

"Others know what happened to Leo, like the faction that's most likely triggered Erin to act like this... Pure."

Hearing this, the others believed what Logan was about to suggest.

"Pure and I have been working together, I can try to explain to them what happened to the Red Heart, and at the same time, we can set up a meeting between our two groups."

"Why don't we ask them what happened that day and what happened to Leo?"

In the end, the group agreed with Logan's decision, and the latter made a call. Surprisingly, it didn't take much convincing them to have a meeting between the two groups, but there was one condition.

The meeting was scheduled at the Pure base.

# Chapter 1799: The Giant God.

The audience in the Celestial Space was increasing with every passing moment, and more and more celestials were needed to support the area as everyone stared at the orb to witness what was about to unfold. The God Slayer from the earth, who was recently causing trouble for many, and a celestial were working together.

Watching all of this among the other Celestials was none other than Bliss.

"You're an idiot, an idiot! And I guess I'm an idiot as well for sending you to this place."

Bliss had a deep frown on her face. "How can you cause so much trouble no matter where you go? Now that they see you working with a God Slayer, they will guess that you are both from the same planet or have a connection."

"If the others learn that a celestial has a connection with a god slayer, then we will become a bigger target than we already are. And of course, I cannot contact the other one." Bliss sighed in indignation.

*** *** ***

On the Amra planet, the ground that Quinn and Sil were standing on started shaking violently. It was as if the planet was frightened of what was coming, of this battle.

After showing all his weapons, the weapons himself and his body started to emit and glow with strong energy. He was covered in a strange white light, constantly moving as if it were alive.

"I'll take on the right side, and you take on the left!" Sil shouted.

"And a warning about this fight, don't hold back, don't play with these guys because they can cause serious damage!"

Sil was already off using super-speed to run straight towards Athos' side. Since Quinn had battled with Sil not long ago, and considering the latter's experience in fighting against Celestials, Quinn thought it wise to take his advice. And as he flew forward, the shadow was already wrapping both of Quinn's demon-tier wings.

Heading straight for Athos, Quinn gathered his blood aura, and while doing so, he covered both his hands with two giant spinning blood drills. He could only wield one of these in the past, but he now had grown used to holding a powerful blood aura.

Seeing him coming towards them, one of the women by Athos side had pulled out two swords and swung them down towards Quinn. From the swing alone, Quinn felt he was getting hit by colossal pressure even though the sword hadn't even reached him.

"What is it... is this gravity... or wind pressure? I don't understand." Quinn thought.

His speed had slowed down, but spinning at the right time, he avoided the sword strike, but a strange drag had pulled him down with it, and he felt even more pressure, forcing him to crash to the ground.

Quinn didn't land very hard, but the pressure had pushed him into the ground, and that had created a crater. Eventually, another sword from the female Golden Amra was coming towards him. With no chance to get out, Quinn jumped up and threw one of his blood drills like a punch. The blood dril instantly clashed head-on against the sword.

The power clash was strong and immense, and it looked like Quinn had the upper hand in this battle of strength, as the sword was pushed back and caused the giant female to stumble around a bit. Seeing this as an opportunity, Quinn ran forward again and headed straight towards Athos, who had yet to move.

At that moment however, the female Amra had moved again, swinging her other arm down. But when she attacked, a large rock had come out at great speed and hit the sword, causing it to go off its trajectory. Quinn had been through enough fights to judge the sword would miss him and that it did.

The second it hit the ground though, Quinn used it as an opportunity. The sword was large, and jumping up, he pushed off the flat surface of the sword to give himself extra strength, and using the momentum, he spun his body and headed towards Amra.

There was only one blood drill, but he gathered the blood energy around him, turning into what looked like a giant blood drill ready to pierce right through Athos chest.

"Thank you guys for helping me out. I wasn't expecting any help, but you have returned the favour. Just be careful." Quinn thought as he looked out of the corner of his eye at those that had helped him.

Geo, Nock, and Dober were staring at the ongoing battle not too far from where the others were fighting. They had strange colored Green rocks in their hand, and it was Geo who had thrown and hit the sword.

"We're crazy for doing this," Nock said. His arms were trembling, and he nearly dropped the rock in his hand.

"How can we even consider going against those who have reached the 90th floor? The one that our god has rewarded the most."

"Because this whole situation is crazy," Geo replied.

"Who would have thought anyone would even be able to touch our god, and right now, we are fighting alongside someone who is on par, if not even stronger than our god."

"We make our own decisions in this world, and I have decided to help him."

Dober laughed at this comment. "I have long grown bored of the towers antics. Besides, this is how I always wanted to go out, with a blast."

"Great, even though you think we're going to die, I haven't given up!" Nock said, hurling the green rock through the air.

As it flew, it created green flames. It was impressive, even for Nock himself, because he had never been able to do such a thing before.

Clearly, something was changing in him, and he was improving rapidly. After years of hitting a limit, it looked like he was finally reaching another stage, not that it mattered anyway, as the golden female just slashed her sword, slicing the rock right in half.

"This is going to be a hard battle... please end this fight quickly, Quinn." Geo thought.

Quinn had made himself move faster as he controlled the blood aura at the right time and suddenly accelerated. He wanted to use the speed change to catch Athos by surprise, and he thought it would have worked, only that Athos had lifted the shield in time.

"I'll smash through that thing and head back to earth!" Quinn shouted.

As his red aura hit the shield, he continued to spin it more and more. Although Athos hand was slightly trembling as he used his strength to stop, it looked like the shield was in perfect condition, not damaged.

That was when, using another hand, holding onto a spear, Athos pulled it back. His limbs seemed to somewhat grow from his body and even had extra joints, which allowed him to put strength while his body was still facing a particular direction.

Seeing this, Quinn quickly decided to stop his attack, and the red aura dispersed. Then, he covered himself with his shadow wings. The spear had hit the wings hard, and the others saw the shockwave coming from the impact as Quinn took the hit head on. He could feel the wind on his back.

Peeking through his wings, Quinn could no longer see Athos, nor could he see anyone else; instead, he was flying through the air at an incredible speed. The force of the attack was so strong that although the shadow blocked it, it hadn't slowed it down or frozen it in place.

Finally, Quinn stopped using his powers and pulled out his wings.

"Just... how far was I sent back?... This raw strength, it's stronger than any Demon tier beast or anyone I have faced before."

If Quinn didn't have the demon-tier wings covered in shadow, he was afraid that he would have died in that single attack.

"He's not faster than me. But speed doesn't do anything even if I attacked him at full speed and treated a large attack. This is all about power. I need more power."

Donning his blue fang set away, Quinn used the tip of his fingernails to make a thin cut on his leg. Then, he hardened them to create a pair of blood-colored Celestial boots. Only this time, he had cut up to his thigh and continued to have the demon-like hardened blood all the way up.

"The chest piece only deteriorates if I use the Celestial energy through my body, but not when I power it through my blood on the outside."

[Twin Tail soul weapon activated]

Small hard pieces of razor-sharp objects could be seen piercing out from his skin and were pronging over his shoulder. But luckily, the chest piece went around his body and over his shoulder. The bits that moved towards his chest only stuck in the piece a little. Although it was harming the piece it was only a little.
