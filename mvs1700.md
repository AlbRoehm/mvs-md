# Chapter 1700: Quinn Museum.

Quinn was silent as he processed what he was witnessing in front of him. Museums are places where proofs and records of important events and people that had impacted history are kept for future generations to see.

Since Quinn hadn't felt the effect of what he had done first-hand and didn't feel like a substantial amount of time had passed, he just couldn't believe what he was seeing.

However, his thoughts were soon interrupted by laughter. Turning around, he saw Peter holding his belly as if he was in pain, hysterically laughing out loud.

"How... just how?" Peter said.

"Why would they make a museum of a single person? Are you a fossil or something?" Peter laughed.

"Oh my gosh! This is the Quinn museum!" Jessica exclaimed, "You really brought us here! I always wanted to visit this place but never got the chance."

Jessica's comment had stopped Peter's laughing, but he was still smirking and raising an eyebrow. Because Jessica wasn't the only one excited, Lucia e before the credits and Hannah looked to be over the moon about being here as well.

"I guess you guys don't understand," Hannah replied as she could see strange looks coming from the two.

"This Museum is quite a famous place. Only one such museum exists on the Earth, located here in Green City.

"You know, getting on Earth is a struggle of its own. You also know that everyone has good opinions of the Great hero Quinn regardless of their faction's alignment. So naturally, many wish to visit this place, including the Red vampires."

Hannah was looking up at the grand entrance with a proud expression on her face.

"Wait for a second," Peter said as he moved closer to Quinn.

"Am I the crazy one? You girls are excited to go into a museum of the Great Quinn when he's right here in front of you!"

Quinn didn't know what to do, so he just smiled at the girls. It did make them realise that it was pretty strange, but they still couldn't contain their excitement. The fact that they were with Quinn still didn't make sense to them.

To them, he was a fantasy, a myth, a legend that they still had lived most of their lives hearing about and seeing the museum had brought them back to a little of how they were.

"Come on, let's head inside... and Peter, I think you will be surprised too," Shiro commented as they headed towards the Museum's entrance.

The Museum was quite large, and it had a designated route for the others to follow.Surprisingly, as the name seemed, not all of it was about Quinn.

There was information about the Dalki, the vampire and the leaders as well. It even showed some of the subclasses that Quinn had gone against, as well as the bloodsuckers on top of it.

There were even large life-size models of many of them. The others were all amazed by what they saw while playing the information videos.

If one stood next to a statue and pressed a button, then a holographic display would play their actions, attacks, and more of what that said beast, creature or the person was like.

While the others were having fun though, for Quinn, it was reminding him of the past and everything that he had gone through.

"This is amazing; everything in here is so detailed," Lucia commented.

"Yeah, there are vampire subclasses here that even I don't know anything about. The people who created this place must be very knowledgeable." Jessica commented.

"That's because they are." This time, the one speaking was Vorden instead of Shiro.

"This whole Museum was made by none other than Logan Green. Someone who witnessed this incredible piece of history with his own eyes."

Quinn knew that wasn't all. Logan could write things in such detail because he also had memories of Richard Eno. It looked like Logan had omitted some details, and for a good reason as well.

"The best bit is yet to come; follow me." Vorden said with a huge smile.

They soon walked through the hallway of the Museum and appeared in front of a big gate, above which, five words were inscribed in gold: The Life of Quinn Talen.

Upon stepping in, they had entered a large cinemalike room, but it was in the shape of a giant sphere. The seats were around half full, and as they sat down, everyone waited for the show to start.

Finally, a hologram display began, and now everyone seated felt like they were experiencing life as it had happened about a thousand years ago.

Not only that, but it had started from the very beginning when Quinn had joined the academy. Although Quinn could see some of the scenes were not entirely accurate because he was the one that lived through them.

However, there was extreme attention to detail, and everyone in the video looked real.

"Quinn's journey began at the Second Military Base Academy. It was where he met life-long friends and experienced a life that inspired him to change the world." The narrator in the video started to speak.

"One experience and friend that truly had shaped Quinn's personality back then was a fellow student named Peter chuck."

Just then, the video showed a frail and sheepish Peter standing near the hallway and nervously looking around with a scared expression on his face.

Suddenly got hit in the gut and was beaten up by the other students. There then was a scene where Peter waited outside of Quinn's and Vorden's dormitory, all beaten.

"Doesn't he look a little like Uncle Peter, and they have the same name!?" Minny said, pointing at the screen.

"But that Peter is really weak... it can't be him; he keeps getting beaten up in the video."

Although it really wasn't something that one should laugh at, Quinn couldn't help himself. He let out a chuckle seeing the old Peter on-screen compared to what he was today.

"What is that wimp doing!" Peter shouted out loud at the screen.

"Fight them, don't let them hurt you like that!" Peter stood up from his seat. It looked like he was more frustrated than others regarding his old past self.

The video continued going through what Quinn had done. The experience at the academy, facing the first Dalki together with his friends and then the next adventures, one by one.

Quinn could see that Logan had done well by not showing other characters' faces, such as Layla or Erin; perhaps there was a reason for that.

Soon, the video showed the demon tier beast and all of the key events that Quinn had experienced. Including what he had done in the vampire world.

Of course, it only went briefly over these things, showing the key things, but the video was done as a well-made movie.

It showed Quinn fighting against vampire leaders, then against Bloodsuckers and more. All three girls and Mithcell hardly blinked as they looked at the screen in amazement. Finally, the video concluded with Quinn defeating Graham.

The video had ended, and as they left the large room, the others couldn't stop talking about the events they saw.

"I never knew the Great hero had been through so much. No wonder he was so strong." Jessica commented.

"It makes sense, and it's even more inspiring that Quinn was never that strong. That he had grown strong through all his experiences." Hannah added as the rest nodded.

"Again, guys, the guy you're talking about is right here; you can stop talking about him like he's dead," Peter said.

"For me, it was nice seeing you peter." Lucia finally said, tapping her feet on the ground.

"Your younger self looked kinda cute."

Hearing this, the others thought Peter would make some remark or shout back in anger like he usually would. Instead, though, he just folded his arms and looked away.

"I guess you're not wrong."

"We still have more to see," Vorden said as they moved to the next room.

When entering, Quin noticed several pieces of equipment that Quinn used to own. He saw the different gauntlets, and there were also replicas of his unbreakable swords, the soul weapon of the twin tails and his other weapons.

However, none of them were the original weapons. At least that's what Quinn thought until his eyes landed on one item that was encased in a glass box, just like the other weapons.

"That's... real," Quinn said. "And to think it's here."

***

# Chapter 1701: A Gift.

Walking up to the case, Quinn could see the item laid out on a cushion in its full glory. It was one of the Demon tier items that Alex way had crafted for him during his time, the Demon tier Amulet.

Demon tier items had always been in a league of their own compared to regular items, and this one in particular had allowed Quinn to turn the tide against his enemies twice.

Once, when the Dalki had launched a full scale invasion against all the planets. Taking control of the Dalki had allowed him to surprise nearly all of them, then the other time was on Blade Island itself. When used with the seedling, it had given him the strength that they needed.

"Whoa, is this actually the real thing and not a replica? It's the only one that's locked up this securely!" Jessica exclaimed with excitement.

Usually, even regular people that weren't in tune with sensing energy would be able to recognize a Demon tier item, but it looked like whatever casing the item had been put in prevented that energy from escaping.

However, as someone who had used it, he would naturally recognise it, though he was wondering how it had ended up here. He could still remember that he had gifted it to Mona...

"It says here, it was a Demon tier item that the Great Hero Quinn had gifted to an ancestor of the Bree family."

"It was reportedly used by her in the Final Dalki War against the Dalki leader Graham and seemingly lost for a few centuries."

"Once it was found, Logan Green purchased it for... how do you even pronounce a number with this many zeroes?!" Jessica stuttered when she saw that information.

"Unfortunately, there does not seem to be any information on it. I guess it makes sense, though. If this is the real thing, there would surely be plenty of people that would target it." Mitchell commented in thought.

"Well, that lack of information has done little to stop people from trying." Shiro stated with a deep sigh.

"In fact, not just this item, but the whole museum has been targeted by all kinds of groups throughout the years of its existence for multiple reasons."

"I'm sorry, Quinn, but during your sleep there were many who had dared to pretend to be you."

"Although the Dalki threat had been gone, your name still held a lot of influence, so there were those that tried to rally others for their cause by pretending to be you, but of course it didn't work out well."

"I believe Layla took care of most of them, but sometimes it was Erin or one of us who took them out."

"I don't know if you've encountered them or not, but there are also people who believe that we shouldn't celebrate you as a Great Hero to this degree."

"The majority of those people either don't believe in your feats, or at least in the severity of the situation overall. The strength of the Dalki had long since been forgotten."

The Celestial Vampire had already seen the latter case when first chancing upon one of his statues.

There would always be those who didn't believe in the tales of the past, assuming them to be greatly exaggerated, so Quinn didn't mind too much. However, he didn't like the idea of people pretending to be him.

Even if he would want to announce his return, there would surely be a lot of backlash since people would rightfully assume him to be just another case.

He was starting to agree with Vorden about why the old Quinn' should perhaps be a name left alone and in the past.

"If this belongs to Daddy, then why is it behind the glass?" Minny asked.

Everyone turned to girl and thought about it. It was undeniable that Quinn used to be the original owner, but he had gifted it away.

Given that Logan had paid a large sum of it, who exactly should be able to claim ownership...

"It's okay." Quinn said to Minny as he ruffled her hair. "I don't really need it any more, and besides even if I did have it I think there is someone else here who is more deserving of it, who I would give it to."

When swaying this, Quinn looked towards Lucia, and she didn't quite understand.

"This item... it has been crafted from the crystal of the beast that took control of Robin Graylash. Although it can't bring back your ancestor, I hope it will help you carry on his legacy."

Lucia's eyes opened wide, and she went towards the amulet. She looked at it carefully, closer and closer to it, until her fingers rested on the top of the glass.

She never realised that an item would draw so much attention from her after Quinn's words, but it did, and the others could see the way this had affected Lucia.

However, after a few seconds, sparks started to emit from the glass, and she felt a sharp tingling sensation over her body. Before it was to get worse, she let go.

"Apologies, but I didn't think you would try to touch it." Shiro explained.

"As I said, there have been frequent attacks on this place, with the said goal of stealing these items. As a result, all the items, even the replicas, are protected."

Seeing that she couldn't get the item, or at least hold it in her hand, Lucia naturally felt a little down. In some ways, Quinn's words had given her hope.

Mitchell had obtained a pair of Demon tier boots, making him stronger, but Lucia still felt like she had no strength or place in the group.

What better way to help and be more apart than a Demon tier item that was related to her family. A visible form could be seen on the face, and Quinn felt like he was partly to blame.

"Don't worry, once we meet Logan, I'll ask him about getting it out of here." Quinn said, feeling guilty about having overlooked such an obvious issue.

Lucia lifted her head to smile, but the smile instantly turned to shock, as she could see a certain someone doing something behind Quinn. He had already readied his fist, and covered it in powerful Qi.

A large smash sound emanated throughout the museum once the glass casing had shattered into several pieces. Turning around, Quinn could see the amulet being held in Peter's hand.

"You wanted to give it to Lucia, right?" Peter shrugged nonchalantly when he saw the looks of disbelief on the faces of the others.

"I mean, it's not like we are stealing anything. As Minny said, it belonged to you in the first place."

Shiro couldn't stop shaking his head, and at the same time, there were others in the exhibit that had heard the loud crashing sound.

They, too, couldn't believe what was taking place. Regardless of all this, there was nothing that Shiro could do now, because it had already started.

Large metal shutters of the entrance and exit of the exhibit hall were closing. The people looked panicked as they were seeing this.

At the same time even outside the exhibit, several barriers of metal looked it to be covering the entire place, making sure no one could leave.

"Well, now what do we do?" Hannah asked.

"We might have to fight a little bit until we can sort this out, because I think Peter's become their target."

Several of the training Al robots were seen falling from the ceiling, appearing from the ground. Laser machines pointed all towards where the amulet was and the rest of them.

Despite all that chaos, Peter didn't seem to care one bit. He simply walked over to Lucia, and carefully placed the amulet with the necklace around her neck.

"Hey... wait Peter!" Lucia stammered, her face all red. She didn't know whether to be happy about what he was doing, or annoyed, but right now the fear was most overwhelming since everything was pointing at her.

"Don't worry. They can't hurt you." Peter proclaimed, standing in front of her. "Not when I'm here."

"Oh..." Vorden had swapped with Shiro, because he just had to snarkily comment on this moment. "It looks like you finally managed to find someone other than Quinn to care about."

*** *** ***

Outside the museum, it had only been a few seconds, yet several vehicles had already turned up. Guards in their uniforms had surrounded the museum to make sure nobody would be able to escape.

That was when an important looking car arrived, and a single person came out, a frown on his face.

"... what are the chances that those guys aren't involved in this?" Logan thought, a slight smirk forming on his face.

***

# Chapter 1702: Black Rock.

The AI robots in the room were strong ones and looked a little different from the ones they would usually see. Last time, Quinn remembered them being almost silver in colour. Similar to the metal or Glathrium like material they were made from.

However, these were jet black, with a glowing single circular red-eye, and the core of its chest reinforced, making it quite large and pointed outward a little.

Using his inspect skill. Quinn could see two that all of the Al robots in the room contained Demi-god tier beasts as their core, and there were at least eight of them.

As for the material, it wasn't glathrium. It was made from Darkrock, which Quinn had never heard of before.

"I have to say this is a pretty good defence for the museum. I'm impressed that Logan went this far... this place must have meant a lot to him." Quinn thought.

While watching this, four of the robots went towards the group from the front, while at the same time, four of them went towards the back.

Vorden, who was currently in charge of the body, hack hardened his skin and went forward, trying to throw out a punch at the robot.

As the two hands collided, Vorden had surprisingly lost out in strength, and it looked like the hard black exterior was unharmed.

"I wasn't expecting a fight..." Vorden said as the hardening around him started to disappear, and he was wondering what he could do to help.

Before the wedding, Vorden had time to prepare, but it had been over 24 hours since those abilities had been gathered.

Vorden did touch some of the citizens that were in the museum. It was a habit of his he had picked up at the academy so he would never be in a desperate situation.

Unfortunately, the abilities he had received weren't the strongest or the best. especially for these robots.

Several blasts of energy had also come toward the group. It would have been easy for Quinn to block this with his shadow, but there were spectators here. Talk about those with the shadow powers had risen lately.

Either way, he didn't think he would need it. Covering a condensed amount of blood aura in the palm of his hand.

Quinn moved it quickly to each spot of the attacks. When the beam of energy hit his hand, Quinn just had to match the power from the attack with his own blood aura and Qi.

Successfully, moving his hand quickly at each of the blasts quicker than the attacks could come out, Quinn had stopped them all from hitting the others behind him.

Seeing that her king was taking care of that, Muka had also decided to act.

She ran up to a robot that was getting ready to fire another blast toward her. Just before it fired, Muka sped up, running towards it and skidded across the floor.

Her foot had hit the bottom of the robot. It was thrown in the air and slammed onto the ground.

Its energy blast laid on top of its head and went off, blasting it in its own face.

"That was lucky" Hannah thought.

The group had created about two semi-cireles to deal with the robots, one side having Quinn, while the other Peter, so they were never worried.

All of them had confidence after the Chained events that they could certainly get through some Al robots, even if they were in some strange black material.

Right now, Peter was somewhat proving that, as he was faster than the robots, hitting them right in the chest and sending them flying back while avoiding a hit of another, grabbing it by the arm and slamming it into the ground.

There were two more robots, and grabbing each of them by the arm, Peter forced them to use their energy blasters on each other's heads before kicking them away.

However, while being hit away and flying through the air, the robots would reposition themselves in midair.

They would use small amounts of energy in the palm of their hands to rebalance themselves and then go straight for the attack again.

Once again, Peter would smash them with his strong hard fist, but he noticed that the strange material wasn't caving in, and that was with him using all of his strength.

"This is getting really annoying." Peter thought "How do I deal with this."

While Peter was thinking about what to do or a way to break the strange hard outer shell, he could see that the robot he had knocked away that was closer to Lucia had decided to go for her.

Lucia could see this, and she was thinking about acting but believed that Peter was someone who would keep their promise and would be able to move faster than her anyway.

The robed figure dashed across the room, and something could then be seen coming out from the hood.

It moved lightning fast, and only a whip-like sound through the air was heard. The after image of an object was seen before it disappeared. In the next second, the Black covered Al robot was sliced in half, falling to the ground.

Peter had transformed using his celestial energy, and it looked like his special head-tail could slice through the Black material.

Perhaps he would have found some other way, but this was the sure way to get rid of them and ensure that a certain someone didn't get hurt.

Still, Peter was careful not to show the tail, using it exceptionally quickly.

On the other side, Peter was somewhat wondering how Quinn would be dealing with this. Their strength in raw power was relatively the same.

Of course, Quinn had better Qi control, Blood control, among other things, but Peter was a little competitive and wanted to see if Quinn had more trouble dealing with the robots than him.

That's when he could see Quinn holding up one of the robots by its head. Its arms had been twisted in a way, so they could no longer be used.

Still, the others were wondering just what Quinn was doing because when he let go, the robot fell to the ground and never got back up.

None of them did; all of the robots Quinn had grabbed by their head had now fallen.

"Well, I'm happy to know the draining gauntlet still works, and it looks like this body can handle a lot more energy." Quinn thought.

What Quinn was doing was using his demon tier gauntlet to drain the Qi energy from the robots. Knowing they had beast crystals inside them, he thought he would give it a shot.

After seeing Chris's amount of energy, the celestial vampire thought it would be best to increase his energy and continue to get stronger even in a place like this.

The intruders had dealt with the Al robots. The others in the room had gone up against the edges of the room, looking frightened.

"They defeated the robots that quickly. Those were the black ones as well. I've never seen someone defeat the black ones." One of them commented.

"Now, what do we do? Should we just break our way out of here?" Peter asked.

Quinn wasn't too sure that was the right decision. This was a nice place, after all.

"Please don't," A voice said, projected over the speaker to the museum.

"I really don't want to rebuild this place. Especially not from scratch, Just follow the doors while the rest of you stay put, and there will soon be others that will come and help you."

One of the shutters that had gone down was moved up. while the others remained closed. It was as if someone was telling them to go a certain way Quinn immediately started walking towards the door because he could tell from the voice. It was the one and only Logan.

The group decided to follow Quinn, and eventually, it looked like they had been led to some type of theatre room.

It looked somewhat like the one that showed details of Quinn's life and the past, but not as big.

For a second, Quinn stopped as he looked at a short man that was across the room. Logan looked a bit older than he did before.

He had even grown a few inches. He only looked a few years older than when Quinn had last seen him, but there was one big change.

Quinn could sense that underneath the strange metallic armour he was currently wearing, that he had a crystal..not just a crystal on him but a crystal in him, and it was a Nest Crystal.

"It looks like a lot has changed since I last saw you." Quinn stated.

"Yes, and it's my job to bring you up to date on everything, Logan answered.

***

# Chapter 1703: Millennial history. (Part 1)

Seeing Logan in front of him, Quinn felt a sense of relief that he was reunited with one of the people who had been with him through his tough times.

After all, he was among one of the first friends he had made in the academy and had stuck with him until this point and time.

He wanted to talk to Logan, in the straightforward way he used to, perhaps in a more comfortable environment.

Still, Quinn also knew that there was a lot to be done before that, and maybe Logan had a better way of showing them everything rather than being questioned one by one.

"I will assume that since all of these people are with you and know you as Quinn, it is safe to tell them everything," Logan stated.

"If that is the case, I will begin my presentation for you."

"Ever since you disappeared, Quinn. I have been working on this project and updating it with all the information that you might need once you wake up."

"But, of course, I never expected things to last this long, and I ended up storing a lot of data."

"To be honest, there is never a moment when I don't feel as if it was my fault that you did not awaken ten years after your slumber as I had predicted."

The girls looked at each other. They had no clue that Logan was a close acquaintance of the Hero Quinn.

They did know that Logan is said to have witnessed and survived back then, when the war had started, and there were rumours that the Green family had supported the great hero, but it was clear that there was much more to it than that.

"I'm ready. Show me everything you got." Quinn nodded.

Logan, in response, pressed a button, and all of the panels of the walls started to light up slightly green.

The next second, they began to show images, and finally, everyone once again felt like they had been transported to another place as if they got teleported.

The place they currently were, was back in the tomb of the tenth castle. Here was where the group agreed to send Quinn off into his eternal slumber.

Again, everything could be heard, including the dialogue of the others, everyone bidding goodbye.

"I created the unique chest piece that would be able to monitor your readings. It notified me how much energy was being consumed from the nest crystal."

"Based on the readings that I had gathered from that day, I concluded that the energy drained from the crystal would take about ten years to complete."

"However, I was very wrong in that prediction. Although you started off consuming a lot of energy from the crystal initially, the rate of consumption slowly began to decrease over time."

The scene changed once more, showing everything as Logan spoke, helping them visualise more. It had gone to the vampire settlement and the state they and the current people were in.

"With the nest crystal being used to keep your body in a stable state, it meant that the vampires no longer had a steady blood supply the same as before."

"Although we knew there were plenty of nest crystals out there in the universe, it didn't solve the current problem."

"At the same time, Earth still wasn't exactly a safe place. The Vampire Soldiers, some of the military forces along with Shiro and Leo, were still suppressing Pure."

"They were doing a good job and were getting rid of bases Pure, one by one."

"This was when a certain individual had stepped up. Perhaps it is a bit unfair to say one individual, as two had stepped up. Fex and Samantha."

"Thanks to these two, the vampires and humans were able to work so well together. The vampires trusted Fex, as they all knew he had a close relationship with you, while the humans trusted Samantha due to her relation to them."

"It was the perfect combination; They had set up systems for vampires and humans, such as blood donation and more."

"Eventually, we also discovered a nest crystal, allowing the vampires to regain their blood supply."

A lot of this Quinn had learnt from Andy, but when did it all start going so wrong?

From what Quinn could see in the videos, the vampires, humans, and everyone was experiencing a happy life. In the video, there were even some scenes with the Dalki.

Quinn remembered that a group of Dalki had agreed to surrender on a certain planet and provided them with information during the war in exchange for mercy.

It was most likely that they were all dead by now singe they had a low life span in the first place.

"The situation back on Earth gradually improved. However, Sera and leo could not locate Zero, Chris or the other core members."

"But they had managed to seize almost all of their operations, taking back everything under their control, and then they handed it to me."

"Finally, for the first time in a long time. Humans were able to go back to Earth, and on top of that, they invited the vampires to live amongst them as well."

"Since many still had a good impression of you, Quinn, there was next to no one against vampires being part of human society."

"Many of the old vampires that somewhat opposed this idea were already in slumber. And the new generation had the choice to decide what they needed to do."

"At the same time, those who didn't wish to go to Earth had the choice to remain in the vampire settlement or settle on the Graylash planets."

Unlike what Quinn had thought, Leo was still alive at this point. They were successful in their tasks. So the question still remained what had changed and what had happened to the Cursed faction.

"Although humans said that they were fine with living among vampires, it was a difficult task."

"Samantha creating what is known as the Vampire Corps today. They managed to keep the vampires and humans in check."

"That was until something strange began to occur."

"More and more humans were being turned into vampires, and they were turned forcefully."

"Pinpointing how and why this was happening was hard, and we failed to deal with the problem. The humans were starting to lose trust, but they decided to listen."

"This was mainly because the Cursed faction, the faction you had created, strongly supported the vampires at the time."

"Most of us were growing old, Quinn, but we were determined to fix things, make things right, and achieve what you wanted."

"In truth, I had even thought about waking you up because of the problem. I was trying to find some way for your body to absorb the crystal."

"After all, it had already been a lot more than just ten years at that point."

"However, when we went to your tomb, you had disappeared, and only you had disappeared because the rest of the vampire settlement was still there, along with everything else."

"We searched for you and Peter a lot and did our best to find both of you, and perhaps because we put too much focus on that, we completely missed what was happening on Earth."

"Something strange was happening slowly; something was changing. In fact, I should say it was the turning point that led to the world's current state."

"I was busy with duties on Earth, creating systems, and helping out Fex on a day to day basis. Meanwhile, Sam continued to focus on the Cursed faction, all of them were looking for you."

"The first sign that something was wrong and the situation was out of control was when Sam suddenly disappeared."

"Till this day, no one knows what happened to him, but without him, the Cursed faction fell apart and began to lose hope and sight of what they were doing in the first place."

"Then, finally, it had started. There was an attack on Earth from someone we had completely forgotten about, the true first vampire king, Laxmus."

***

# Chapter 1074: Millennial history. (Part 2)

For the first time during Quinn's search for what had happened, he had heard the name Laxmus. There were many regrets in Quinn's life, the choices he made, and not killing Laxmus was one of them.

Laxmus was the cause of chaos for the vampire settlement, and after taking the strange shadow powers that Bryce had, Quinn always feared that when he did return, he would be stronger than before.

"There also was the strange marking that was on top of his back before he transformed." Quinn thought.

"Without a doubt, he is linked to one of the celestials. The question is which one and what is their condition."

"If I remember correctly, Laxmus said something about sending as many lives as possible to their death."

"If that is the case, then Laxmus could be one of the most dangerous people to look out for."

The scenery had changed, showing battles going on Earth. It reminded Quinn of the many fights that he had been in. This wasn't some small scale battle, it was full-on war.

The only difference was that humans and vampires were fighting against the enemy from the beginning.

"Laxmus didn't attack on his own. He had an army of vampires with him, and they were incredibly strong." Logan continued to explain.

"They were quite large in number while also being able to transform, just like Laxmus himself could back then."

"It was safe to say they had more power than that of the vampire leaders, and with the vampire leaders mostly being asleep, it was left to the vampire corps and the rest of earth to deal with them."

"During the battle against Laxmus and his vampires, the trust in vampires and humans were growing further and further apart, and that's when we learnt of two more great losses."

"One of them being Leo, and the other Samantha." Hearing this, something sounded strange to Quinn.

"Wait, didn't Chris say that he had seen Leo die? Then why would he die in the attack against Laxmus and not one against Pure?"

"And Fex stated that Erin was the one that killed Samantha. Was she working with Laxmus? Is she a part of the red vampires?"

There were a lot of confusing things for Quinn. He wanted to ask questions now but thought it was best till he got the entire picture to ask the rest. So, for now, he would just listen.

"If it was just a fight against the enemy, perhaps we would have been able to do something, but because of the infighting between the human groups."

"Things got out of hand. This wasn't just a simple war. This fight with Laxmus and his vampires went on for a very long time."

"It appeared that the Graylash group were also experiencing troubles themselves and were hardly able to help. As the human forces, the Green family, and the Cursed faction weekend, It looked like the fighting would never end."

"Until another group that had also been building up power for a return had arrived."

"Pure..." Quinn guessed and mumbled.

"Correct."

It was the only guess that seemed probable. It would explain how Pure had managed to gain so much favour with the people of today and how they became such a big force.

"Pure, said they were there to fight for the people."

"They had been gathering up their power similar to Laxmus in a way, staying quiet as if they had been wiped out."

"Many had forgotten about them, who they were, and their bad deeds. It was the perfect time for them to act."

"With them, Pure had brought a new class of Hybrid beasts. Similar to those that you had faced before."

"Using these, they were able to fend off the attack from Laxmus and pushed them back."

" We don't quite know what happened to Laxmus himself, but it is theorised that he is the leader of the Red vampires of today."

"After the attack, Pure were making strides with the people. They had lost a lot, and they had also lost the bridge with Samantha that connected them with us."

"I and Fex did what we could to try and help and convince the people to our side, but Fex had chosen to go into a deep sleep."

"Meanwhile, the Cursed faction were being hunted. It was then that the Dhampirs started to appear, and they had targeted the Cursed faction members as their number one target."

"The people needed someone to blame of this mess, and they had chosen those from the Cursed faction."

"I had distanced myself away from them, but the other members weren't so lucky, and the Cursed faction was no longer, being forced to split. Everyone was hunting the saviours of the world."

It was a sad tale, and even now, Quinn was clenching his fist in anger. The others had opened their mouths as they couldn't believe it. History that they weren't quite sure of, the history that had been somewhat lost.

"Although Split, everyone had their own goals of what they wished to achieve. Vorden and both Raten were being hunted due to being Demon tier beasts."

"The great powers wanted to use their bodies as weapons. So, they both decided to give up their bodies and help the Graylash family that were in trouble and their own Blade family that was growing."

"It was decided that the best thing to do was to allow the Cursed name to be forgotten. So everyone could continue to work in the shadows, all for you, Quinn."

"There was one thing that we all believed. that one day you would come back."

The little video had ended there, but they're still were a lot of things that Quinn didn't understand, but he was taking in what he had heard and was trying to fit things in place in his head.

"Honestly, if we knew when your return would be, perhaps things could have been set up differently."

"At the moment, the Green family is working with Pure, in the hopes of getting rid of the red vampires."

"I don't know how much you know, but they seem to be after the red heart."

"An item that you had created during your fight with Graham. It is believed to have an unlimited amount of blood energy. One beyond any blood crystal ever seen."

"The Red vampires want to turn everyone into vampires. So I thought it was in our best interest, for now, to work together to get rid of them."

"In the meantime, I have been trying to learn as much information as possible from them."

"At the moment, the only thing I have somewhat been able to gather is they had, at some point, raided the vampire settlement."

"This isn't public knowledge, but it seems to be the case."

"However, as for the tombs of the originals, or the giant stone tablet, those things are not in their possession, so it's hard to pinpoint what exactly happened."

That had lined up with what Muka said, but it looked like no one had any clue what had happened to him, the vampires, the tablet, or Owen.

"I have some questions, Logan if you don't mind, I would like you to answer now and honestly. I'm hoping that you will know."

"Recently I met up with Chris, and he stated that he saw Leo die? Who killed Leo."

"On top of that, before meeting the rest of you, I also met up with Fex."

"He told me that the one that had killed his wife, Samantha was Erin, so that means she is with Laxmus, with the red vampires. It would make no sense."

"The Dhampirs stated that Erin was the Queen and the dhampirs have an urge to kill vampires, so why would they be working together?"

"Finally, I want to ask, what about the rest of the Cursed faction members. Did they live peacefully, are they still out there somewhere."

"What about Sil, where was he during the fighting, and Vincent, what happened to him?"

"None of these are mentioned in your story, and lastly... Layla, what about her? Is she with the red vampires as well?" Quinn asked.

***

# Chapter 1705: Millennial history. (Part 3)

Quinn was concerned about everyone in the Cursed members, from those who had been with him for a long time, such as Alex, to those he hadn't known for long before he went into slumber, such as Hayley.

However, he believed that most of them would have chosen to live their life freely until the end, and hopefully hadn't got involved in all of the current mess that was going on.

"I am sure you want to know more about what happened to everyone in the Cursed faction," Logan said, smiling at them.

"The Cursed faction is not really known to the current generation, but I knew you would care about them all."

"I have, to the best of my ability, kept track of all members of the Cursed faction for the longest amount of time, whether they know it or not."

"But, I have not been in contact with most of them; please keep that in mind while you see the next slides."

Behind Logan, the screen started to change once again, and the first image that appeared was surprisingly of Alex Way, the forger that Quinn had later turned into a subclass called the Blood Fairy.

"Now, before I continue, I want to state that most of the members of the Cursed faction lived a fulfilling and long life."

"So if you do not see them on this list, it's alright to assume that they had lived through the peaceful years that you had created, Quinn."

"In fact, Alex Way was one of them. However, as time went on, Alex became a legendary renowned weapon forger due to his skills."

"He was one of the few people who could create a Demon tier weapon that would fulfil its true potential."

"Because of this, there were many groups after him, even before the fighting and battles had started."

"In fact, the danger was so much that Alex had created quite the legendary set of equipment for himself to defend himself."

"After all, we couldn't protect him all the time, thus he didn't wish to take any risk."

"Still, multiple groups had gone after him for more reasons than one when all the chaos happened."

"If you remember, Alex used fairy blood in his weapons."

"This was incredibly useful when fighting against vampires."

"Knowing this, Pure, the Dhampirs and the humans were heavily after him. There was one thing that they were unaware of though, and it's the fact that fairy blood is also effective against dhampirs."

"I learnt of this thanks to Richard Eno's knowledge that had been left behind."

"Knowing everyone was after him, I had figured out a way to put Alex into an eternal slumber, similar to how the vampires were put to sleep."

"At first, he was against this and wanted to stay to fight against the enemies, but then Andrew... the other Blood fairy, was killed by the enemies."

"After that, Alex was more inclined to listen to our ideas."

Raising his left forearm, Logan tapped on it. His entire arm was encased in a strange metallic object, and in the next second, something popped out: it was a small vial with a red liquid inside.

Logan threw it out towards Quinn, who caught it, and used his inspect skill on the object.

[Blood Fairy blood belonging to Alex Way]

"Alex went into a deep slumber, and the plan was to wake him up when needed and when we could protect him."

"Now, we need him for both of those reasons. However, someone... has taken Alex."

"Perhaps it's the same people behind the disappearances of the original vampires, but I don't know."

"I think that this vial is better in your hands. You're more likely to find him before I do, Quinn."

"Use that vial and wake him up when you do. I am sure he will be happy to see you. He always wanted to thank you for changing his life."

[New quest received]

[Find the Blood Fairy Alex Way's tomb and wake him up again.]

"One more Quest..." Quinn thought.

So far, he had no luck in Owen's Quest, so he knew that this would be a hard one as well, but it would perhaps give him answers to the other vampires.

This could be a way to resolve things without him. If Quinn was to disappear from this world again, if they had Alex. they could perhaps have a way to fight the dhampirs because his ability was a massive weakness for the latter.

Still, the blood fairy weapons were a double-edged sword since they worked against the vampires as well.

"You asked about Leo and Erin. I am aware of who Erin is at the moment. I don't know what happened or why she had attacked Samantha back then."

"Based on her and her group's actions, I don't believe she is with the Red vampires or Laxmus."

"It doesn't make any sense, but I don't know why she would have attacked Samantha at that time."

"I'll be honest, what the Dhampirs and what Erin is doing at the moment makes the least amount of sense to me."

"But, unfortunately, I haven't had a chance to talk to her. Still, something has been seen with the Dhampir leader and take this as you will."

"It's a large monstrous figure, sometimes appearing by her side from the shadows."

"With fingers so large that they scratch the floor when its hands are by its side." Although there was no footage, Quinn could guess what was being hinted at.

"He... decided to go to her after leaving me?... but why her?"

"As for Leo... I only came to know later that he had died fighting on the battlefield against the vampire attack and the Pure."

"Perhaps they would know more about what happened to him but if I tried to ask them about it, I don't think they would listen to me at all."

The screen then changed, and to everyone's surprise, the person they could see on screen was Quinn himself, but it wasn't the current long-haired Quinn. It was the short-haired younger version of him.

The version that the others recognised more due to the statues and paintings of him looking this way, been able to gather information.

"You asked about Vincent. This person is someone whom I have been looking for myself but have not have been sightings of him, or you."

"In multiple different places: there were stories and even a video of him. I believe Vincent is very much still alive to this day."

"But he has been missing since we placed you in the tomb. Also, he hasn't tried to make contact with any of us."

"We can't deny that there has to be a reason why he is hiding, but I am afraid, only he knows what that is. Maybe he's waiting for your return to show himself?"

Finally, Layla appeared on the screen, but she looked a bit different from before.

Layla was covered in dark clothing and had huge dark bags under her eyes in this image. At the same time, there were scars on her face and over her body.

Finally, Quinn could see that underneath her name, it stated the leader of the Red vampires.

"Leader Black!" Hannah said, standing up. "Leader Black was a member of the Cursed faction?!"

Now Hannah was starting to understand why Quinn had asked her the question of the Red Vampire leaders.

"I don't know what has happened to Layla, Quinn. All I know is that she used that black sword a lot in her fights."

"She was in contact with the Cursed faction for a while, eventually deciding to leave not long after Sam's disappearance."

"The others thought that she had gone looking for him. Only later to find out that she was part of an organisation called the Red Vampires."

Quinn couldn't help but clench his fists when thinking about what to do. He wanted to speak to Layla and ask her a few questions.

Also, the Dhampirs were planning an attack acainst the Red Vampire. Quinn needed to decide what to do.

The image on the screen changed once more, and Sil replaced Layla.

***

# Chapter 1706: Millennial history. (Part 4)

Quinn was wondering what happened to Sil for a few reasons.

First, learning that Vorden and, most likely, Raten was also still alive, gave him hope that Sil was as well, but that begged the question, where was Sil right now?

And where was he during all of the chaos that had gone on? Did something unforeseen happen that made Sil unable to help his allies, or did he also disappear?

From what he had learnt, Sil had unlocked his soul weapon. Something that the Blades hadn't been able to do before.

It was believed that they couldn't, but in the end, he was the one who succeeded, and with his powers, he was able to do some crazy things.

There were only two things that let Sil down when fighting, his lack of experience and the deficiency of Qi.

However, he could improve both of these things over time, and after a thousand years, he was sure to be strong, that was if he had survived that long anyway.

There was the big question of how the Blades were alive in the first place. Qi could only slow down the ageing process, and even Owen had eventually died with his skill.

However, when looking at Vicky, she didn't seem too skilled in Qi, yet she was still alive. Also, she didn't even have a Nest crystal, like Logan, so there had to be something else.

"Talking about Sil... Well, it's quite complicated and to make you understand, I should explain from the beginning." Logan started to explain.

"You know there was a lot of information that I got from Richard Eno, most of which I couldn't even quite understand."

"It took me a lot of time to even process all of the information and get to a point where I can understand it to some degree."

"And even after all that time, there is still a lot of data which I need to comprehend and make sense out of it..."

"What I'm going to talk about soon is perhaps something that only you might somewhat understand."

"So first, I have to ask you, have you ever heard the term God Slayers?"

Out of all the words to come out of Logan's mouth. Quinn never expected to hear this. It was a word that he has recently learned of due to the System. What it meant, he had no idea about that.

"I have only heard of it from the system," Quinn replied to Logan, knowing that the others wouldn't understand, but Logan would.

"That makes some sense then, Logan replied. "First, let me explain the information that I had gathered."

"The Gods of this world are known as Celestials. That includes the ones in our realm and the realms that we're unaware of."

"The Celestials are spread far and wide in the entire Universe and all of them have conditions that they need to fulfil for the world to stay in balance."

"To fulfil the conditions that the Universe has given them, the Celestials love to keep everything in perfect balance."

"Some chose to work together or use their powers in strange ways, all for this condition."

"However, there are few who bring imbalance in the Universe, and the term for them is God Slayers."

"These God Slayers can be anything, of any race, from humans to strange beasts out there in the Universe."

"And as I said, they have gained this title because they can mess up the Universe's balance."

"However, when going through Richard Enos research, it seems as if these God Slayers themselves are some sort of balance, or should I say, some sort of countermeasure to keep the Celestials in check."

"Because when a God Slayer dies, their power does not disappear, and it is passed on to another in a form of a crystal which is produced that cannot be destroyed."

"However, the Celestials themselves don't see it this way. Most of them believe God Slayers are an anomaly that they must get rid of."

"God Slayers naturally arise as they grow in strength."

"But, because Earth has been considered weak for a long time, naturally, there weren't many Celestials near Earth because there weren't many God Slayers around here."

"I know it's complicated, but I hope you can follow what I am trying to explain."

The others had realised eyebrows and confused looks on their faces, but Quinn somewhat understood because he had been learning about Celestials from the system.

"What does this all have to do with Sil, though?" Quinn asked. "The Blade family continued to grow after you left Quinn, Logan answered. "The kids you rescued from that island grew up."

"They had families and passed on the ability of the Blade family, but no one from the new generations even came close to the ability of Sil."

"There were those that unlocked their own soul weapons like my son Jake. However, no one could hold and had a strong soul weapon like Sil."

"In fact, during his time, he had even learned to use Qi to a great degree, better than Hilston."

"To put it simply, Sil had become a being on the level of a God Slayer during that time. I told him everything knew and the information that we had gathered."

"In the end, we decided that Sil should go out exploring in space, in search of other God Slayers and their powers to make himself stronger and get more powers to help us."

"On top of that, there was something scary in Richard's information. There are more races than we know of in the vast universe, and thus, there are many Celestials and God Slayers."

"Richard seemed quite afraid of something bigger coming after us."

"Since Humans have had to struggle and go through many wars, more and more on Earth are being given the title worthy of becoming a God Slayers, which is a dangerous thing. But Sil is out there, protecting us all."

For a further explanation, Logan elaborated that Sil had a ship to explore the vast universe, and he was constantly fighting.

Once in a while, he would get a report from Sil about his adventures and deeds.

It honestly sounded amazing, an adventure in itself, and Quinn couldn't believe that the Sil he knew had become such a great person.

And this also made him wonder if the two of them fought today, who would win?

This was from the competitive side of Quinn, which would come out once in a while. He also knew that Logan was right. Chris was considered a God Slayer as well.

If he was to think of others that would fit this title, there was Ray, and perhaps Graham was also at the level at the end stage of the war.

With so many God Slayers in the history of Earth, then according to what they had learnt, soon there will be Celestials coming from other parts of the universe to come to deal with them.

Honestly though. Quinn was finding it hard to believe something like that would occur, and even if it did, there was a lot he needed to worry about on Earth before that happened anyway.

"So how did Sil and the others manage to survive for so long? Is it because Sil is a God Slayer, but what about Vicky?" Quinn asked.

"I believe you remember Sil's ability"

Vorden was the one replied this time, "He has a record of every ability he has ever come across, and among them, there was a particular ability that allows the user to use their MC cells to reverse the ageing process."

"He used this on the Blade members that wished to continue living."

"There were reasons why Vicky and Sil wanted to use the ability, but not every member of the Blades wanted to do so."

"The ability is something that only works for the user. So the only ones that can use this are the ability users themselves and the Blade family."

"It is not something like the second family ability of the vampires that could be used on others."

"This is why I am afraid... we couldn't help Fex. However, Shiro had already helped Raten and me by putting us in one of the other Blades."

"After living their life, they agreed to help us by letting us transfer to their body and reverse the ageing process."

"Then before Sil left, he used Shiro's ability to transfer him to this body as well."

"Shiro wanted to stay alive, and for helping us out so much, we agreed. Shiro said he wanted to see you before bidding farewell."

Now Quinn had been given his answers to how the others had survived and what they had been doing during all this time.

The question was, what was he to do now? There was a lot for him to do, and thus, he needed to organise his thoughts.

To find the Red Heart, to find Alex, Vincent and the Original vampires, to solve the mystery behind Owen's murder and Leo's death, to stop Laxmus, to find the motivations of Erin and Pure.

And to find out why Layla was with the Red Vampires.

Now, there was also the matter of Sil, God Slayers and the Celestials.

"It's time to get busy."

***

# Chapter 1707: A ping.

After Logan concluded the presentation, Quinn was getting a much-awaited catch-up with Logan. At first, they flew around the city in these levitating pods that looked to be powered by strange crystals.

There was clear open glass on one side, while it was pitch black to the outside. This way, only they could see through the other side, while no one else could see inside the flying pods.

Logan knew that their group would attract a lot of attention, so this was the best way to travel around.

It was amazing for them, including the girls who were originally from this time, to see the majestic cityscape.

It was clear that they had never experienced this city before as they gazed upon all of the large structures that shot up from the sea, creating large platforms for everyone to live and move across.

"Many more things have changed in the past thousand years. I know it may not seem like much, but there are." Logan explained to Quinn.

"As we continue to discover more planets in the beast solar system and out of that, we are learning about different types of minerals and crystals."

"With this, we have been able to grow our technological state. It allowed us to function more as the vampire settlement had done."

"This is a time where structures, infrastructures and even computer-based things can be comprised or destroyed."

Seeing a mother and her child enjoy what looked like a shopping trip down the street, Quinn couldn't help but smile at this scene.

"I don't doubt that much of this is because of you," Quinn replied. "You really have done a lot."

Continuing their trip, Logan explained all the architecture and even went to explain some of the defence systems they have set up.

Not only was the city protected, but Logan had also created a few advanced satellites and fleets that would be stationed just outside of the earth's atmosphere.

He went on to explain how Pure was also part of this operation. In the end, the two groups realised that they wished to protect the earth. If that was gone, what would they be fighting over or protecting in the first place?

This security system was there to protect them from any real outside forces that might choose to attack earth, and the collaboration was to show the people that they could do things together.

It was quite impressive, which just begged the question, even more, why all of these groups had to fight?

Just as Quinn was thinking about this. Suddenly, a large explosion went off in the city. The pod quickly turned and moved on Logan's command and headed towards the explosion.

And when they came close, they saw a masked stranger running through the city.

"That mask... it's a Red Vampire." Hannah commented.

"It's quite close to the facility; perhaps they were trying to find out what information we have." Logan observed.

"Should we stop him and capture him?" Jessica asked. "You don't have to worry about that," Logan replied.

Just as Logan replied, Black armoured Al robots began to come out from the group. And it wasn't just one, but a number of them, and in the next instant, they were going after the intruder.

It didn't take long for the intruder to get collared and captured by the robots.

"This system has many defences, and the colour of the Al robots dictates how strong they are... black is the highest grade and the strongest robots the city has."

"As you can see, they also act as the police force and can deal with the small threats we have once in a while quite well. It's not every day someone of you two's calibre would come here."

Although Quinn didn't really get to test out the strength of the robots. Peter had crossed arms against them, and he knew they were a pain. And, depending on how many robots the city had, it was safe to say it was well protected.

The tour came to an end as the flying pod moved towards a tower that had a large strange green glowing object on top of it. After careful observation, one could see it was a giant ball of energy.

This was where Logan spent most of his time. Upon entering the tower, Quinn felt the same vibe he did with all the other places of Logan's he had visited.

The whole place was a controlled mess. Again, items were everywhere, and it looked more like an experimental lab than an office.

However, here multiple different crystals were being experimented on rather than gadgets.

"I guess, as long as he's got something new to look over, he's happy to keep spending his time in this world."

"I thought he would have gone mad after a thousand years." Quinn thought.

The others were sent to a relaxation room where the staff would treat them with whatever meal they wished to have, and they could finally relax and recover from the battle.

Meanwhile, Quinn and Logan were left to speak on their own for a second.

Before leaving the office, Vorden looked back at the two and closed the door.

"I just wanted to talk to you, just the two of us for a moment or two, Quinn." Logan started.

"I have been trying to find a replacement for myself, to run the operations from this place, so I have been creating an Al system that is similar to me."

"I believe if you give me a week or so, I can perfect it so it can go to meetings in my place and can..."

Quinn raised his hand to stop Logan from continuing.

"You don't have to come with me." Quinn smiled.

"Look, I know you want to. You stayed, you did all of this, got involved in all of this because of me, and honestly, you don't understand how thankful I am for seeing the result."

"After seeing everything you built up and everything you have done, I realised that you are no longer just someone who was part of the Cursed faction."

"No, that's not right; you never were just someone who was part of the Cursed faction, you're Logan Green."

"You were destined to do great things, and you have done. You have this whole city, I mean, you're the leader of the Human race, at least half of it."

"On top of that, you have your own family and all this space force and advanced technological stuff."

"So I can't just come here and take you away, and if you won't listen and still think of yourself as a member of the Cursed faction, I'm ordering you to continue doing what you are doing."

Logan was speechless for a moment. He slowly pressed his hands on the table and then turned around to look outside through the glass walls of the tower.

"I... I will listen to what you say, but I just won't follow every order." Logan replied and turned around.

"As you said, I'm not part of the Cursed faction; I am a Green. That means I can do what I want. So why would I need to listen to you." Logan smiled.

"Quinn, no matter what, those close to you will follow you. I have observed this fact, and do you know why we will follow you?"

"We all know that you would do anything you could to help us if we were in your place, and that's why we are willing to do the same."

"No matter what, whatever you need help with, information, weapons, or if I think you are in trouble, I promise I will help you somehow."

" I guarantee that. Whatever time of day it is, no matter how tired I am, I will answer your call when needed because I know that you will do the same."

"I just want to ask you, what are you planning to do now, and how can I help you with it?"

Shaking his head, Quinn couldn't believe it. Of course, Logan, of all people, would be able to use his own words to find some type of loophole.

"I found out from Andy, Fex's son, that the Dhampirs are planning an attack on the Red Vampires."

"It looks like they have some information about their base or where they are located."

"I was just curious about the Red Vampires before, but now I've decided I need to find them."

"I need to find Layla before the Dhampirs attack them."

A familiar notification sound popped in his ears just as he finished these words, and two lines appeared in his head.

It was clear it was from his system, but he wasn't expecting any of this, and when he saw what they were, he was stunned.

[Congratulations, you are now a level 2 Celestial]

[A new celestial ability has been unlocked]

***

# Chapter 1708: A Comeback!

"I can't believe he actually did it." Andy thought while staring out of the glass wall of his tower towards the Vampire Corps members training in front of him.

"He saw them practising their different skills, including the Blood Strike, as they pushed their body beyond the limits."

Some had even collapsed onto the ground, asking for blood, as their skin looked dried up and withered from overexerting the skill.

The training had been intense for the Vampire Corps ever since learning about the Dhampirs l plans.

Although Andy already knew that the dhampirs were strong, he never thought they would be bold enough to launch a full-on attack.

Because no matter who is involved, be the attacker or the defender, both of them would be in a weakened state after a while, and there would be a risk of a third party taking advantage of this situation.

Of course, they could just be expecting that the Vampire Corps would keep to their word of not being the aggressors, or perhaps there was the fact that Pure would be there to have their backs.

But in Andy's eyes, none of these was enough guarantees for the Dhampirs.

The most likely reason would be that they believed they had the strength to take on the Red vampires and the Vampire Corps, which was why Andy had intensified the training routine.

However, Andy's current expression didn't have anything to do with this. Instead, it was because of what had occurred at the Chained event.

"I thought my father was exaggerating some of the stories about Quinn, but it seems like he is really the type to act and help his friends no matter what, and in this case, he even succeeded." Andy thought.

He had been trying to decide what to do for a while now. While the event was taking place, Andy could see what was happening, and even then, he was undecided on whether he should stick to his ways or do as his father had said.

Yet, there was a strange feeling in Andy, and he knew exactly what it was.

"Father, the Vampire Corps you and mother created... l thought it was my duty to take it over for the longest time, and I have done it with everything I had."

"I don't know if I have done an excellent job or not, but I have always tried my best for you."

"Only to find out that the Vampire Corps was never intended for me and was meant for him."

Andy played the video again, which showed the confidence in Quinn's face as he summoned the dragon from the shadow.

There were also videos of the fights from those who followed Quinn. Andy had watched all the videos again and again for some reason.

Trying to clear his head a little, he then decided to take a step outside and walked amongst the Vampire Corps people.

Wherever he passed by, the members would pause and give him a salute while uttering his name and his post - the Commander in reverence.

Standing directly on the training field were around five thousand or so vampires. Finally, everyone stopped their spars and turned towards their Commander and saluted him. Looking at them all Andy smiled.

"Maybe you are more deserving to lead them than me." Andy thought.

"I guess they do belong to you." He whispered something to one of the lieutenants by his side, and he soon rushed off and gathered five more men to help him with the task that he had sent.

Feeling that something was about to happen, the Vampire Corps members stood there in silence while waiting for Andy to say something.

The lieutenant vampire returned a few moments later along with the five members, and they were carrying something with them.

It was a large statue of the Hero Quinn. It was thick and heavy in size, but the vampires, with their strength, were able to carry it with ease.

They carefully placed it on the ground, and everyone stared at the greenish statue. The statue was originally made of copper and had a shiny gradient of brown, but over time, it turned green due to its exposure to the environment.

Going to the statue and standing in front of it, Andy's expression turned everyone silent, and they knew he was about to declare something.

"Recently, I have been going through quite a journey myself, and I know many of you have your own lives and your own adventures that you must have gone through."

"However, during that journey, I had forgotten the roots of the Vampire Corps. The Corps that my parents created, and the fact that without this person." Andy pointed towards the statue.

"We wouldn't be here today. The whole existence of the Vampire Corps today exists because of this person, which is why to show my honour to him, I shall sacrifice some of my blood."

With the help of his elongated nail, Andy made a small laceration on his own hand and knelt down in front of the statue, letting the blood drip into the ground to be absorbed.

Andy didn't need to give the others an order or tell them why he was doing this. The members, in turn, started to follow what Andy did as well.

It started with the lieutenant and the other higher commanding officers, and eventually, all the vampires present did the same thing by sacrificing some drops of their blood.

Over five thousand vampires at the main base on earth had done this.

Standing up, Andy looked back at the Vampire Corps Unit, who had followed his actions. He couldn't help but smile at them once again.

"Once a month, in front of the Great Hero Quinn, we will continue this ritual. We must not forget our roots and must not forget what he has done for us!"

Andy lifted his hand in the air, and others could see two thin lines of blood streaming down his arm as the cut on his arm slowly healed itself.

The vampires followed this action, and they all raised their fists in the air doing the same. It was quite a sight to see.

"I don't understand your reason for asking me to do this, but I have never seen the vampires more united than ever."

"Maybe this was your aim? Who knows. However, whatever the case, you have proven yourself enough, so I will listen to you." Andy thought.

Seeing this very sight, in one of the towers that surrounded the Vampire Corps base, a man stood in silence, adorning a dark robe that fluttered in the wind.

Seeing his curly hair, and muscular and broad outline, one would guess him to be a man, but he hid his face with a tightly fitted mask covering the lower half of his face.

"The world has once again started to become exciting. And Quinn has returned right at this moment. Maybe all of this is your doing; you always were able to change things, unlike me."

"If the world sees you in this light and in this way, then maybe I can use that to my advantage somehow."

The man raised his hand to his mask. It looked like he was about to take it off, but just then

"Hey! No one should be on this tower. State your unit and rank!" A vampire shouted.

Quickly moving his hand into his robe, the man dropped something on the floor and in the next instant, smoke enveloped the entire place.

The vampire tried to focus on the aura and energy it could feel, but he found nothing upon looking through the smoke.

That was because the intruder had already run past the Guard long ago.

"Damn it, an intruder... he was a vampire, I'm sure of it, but what was that other energy that I felt from him?"

"How did I lose sight of them from a stupid smoke bomb!?" The Guard was furious,

Running towards the city that was closely attached to the Vampire Corps base, the hooded man covered himself once more and continued to walk.

When finally entering the city, the man noticed something. All the screens, from big posters to small devices, showed reports about the events in the Chained faction.

It had already been a couple of days, yet it was still a hot topic amongst the populace, and they couldn't stop talking about the event. After all, the event revealed many things.

Stopping in the middle of the street, the man looked up and on a tower was a large screen showing the frozen-frame image of a certain individual, and below it was a line in bold red letters:


"Quinn, I guess it's time for me to act."

# Chapter 1709: Level 2.

[Celestial Level 2]

[5225/5234 Celestial energy]

After seeing the notifications pop up, Quinn checked his celestial points, and he was in for a surprise. However, this time it looked to be quite the nice one.

"These celestial points... was it Andy? Did he fulfil my request? It has to be him, I can't think of anything else, and it looks like I must have hit some cap that allowed me to level up."

Currently, Quinn didn't feel any different levelling up as he did with the system in the past.

Instead, his body felt the same, but that was because he only received a strange feeling in his body when actually using the Celestial Energy, and with this many points, he wondered what he could now do with them.

"It seems like something has caught your attention," Logan commented, as Quinn's face wasn't hiding the obvious.

Thinking about it for a little bit, Quinn wondered if he should inform Logan. The latter already knew about the system, and on top of that, he had all of Richard Eno's knowledge, maybe working together, they could figure out a few things.

In the end, Quinn revealed everything to Logon about the changes that had occurred after absorbing the Nest crystal, his current quests and all that he knew about Celestial.

"A celestial," Logan repeated as he looked off into the distance as if trying to bring up certain things.

"1 thought that your body had gone through a significant change. It was quite apparent after you had defeated Graham.

"There was quite a lot of information about Celestials in Richard's files. He had worked quite close with one of them, the one named Bliss who we had seen before. She, too, is a celestial level being. From what I know, the condition to level up is quite different for everyone."

"For example, your condition resets every month. If some don't fulfil your condition, then you weaken as a god."

"As for others, I believe their condition lasts longer or might be more permanent but, at the same time, is more challenging for their followers to same time, is more challenging for their followers to fulfil."

"At the same time, yours truly focuses on as many people being alive on the planet as possible."

Logan was rambling, but one could tell he was thinking deeply about this, so Quinn didn't want to interrupt him with his thoughts but eventually did speak.

"I was wondering about something," Quinn said.

"If Sil has become a God slayer after getting so strong, why have I become a celestial, but not a god Slayer?"

"Ray told me that my shadow power originally came from a God slayer, so I thought I would also become one in the future!"

Raising his eyebrows, it looked like Quinn's question was the light bulb moment that Logan needed to piece together.

"What you said is certainly strange, but I have a few opinions based on what I have learned."

"First, due to their conditions, the Celestials essentially need many people to believe in them or follow them. That's why you have a specific set amount of abilities as well."

"Quinn, you became a ruling figure many people looked up to, especially after Graham. While in Sil l s case, there aren't many that have him constantly in their thoughts or minds."

"Perhaps, there may be a set of certain conditions that need to be met before one can become a celestial. But, honestly, we don't have an answer."

"I believe it's the universe's energy that decides everything related to this, and this is more believable compared to other guesses."

"Which is why I also believe there could be another reason from what I stated before."

"Your condition focuses on keeping you alive in people's memory, and if more and more people die, in other words, if the people who remember you die, you would be unable to fulfil your condition."

"So perhaps the universe felt like too many people were going a certain way."

It was a lot to think about, but in the end, it seemed like there just wasn't a definitive answer, and if that was the case, there was no point thinking about it too hard.

The best thing to do was live the life that he wanted to live while focusing on protecting his people. If he started thinking about this too much, it was almost as if there was no meaning to what they were trying to do.

"What I am more interested in are the nine levels of the Celestials and the abilities that come with each level." Thinking about this, Quinn brought up the system's new skill he had learned.

[New skill gained]

[Celestial Weapon Marking]

[The marking of a celestial may be placed on any weapon, armour or shield. When placing a marking, a certain amount of celestial energy is used. This is dependent on the strength of the weapon/object the celestial marking is used on. Celestial points used to mark objects are permanently fused with the object]

[The effects the making will have on the weapon are dependent on the celestial and on the weapon's stats.]

The information on the skills wasn't as direct as Quinn would have liked it to be, but after reading, it seemed the skill would be on a case by case basis, making it hard to do so.

"That means that the Sword which Layla had, had a celestial Weapon marking, and if I remember correctly, it was the same marking that showed up on Laxmus?"

"I let her keep that weapon because I couldn't find anything wrong with it... but maybe that was the wrong choice. It could also be why she is with the Red Vampires."

Thinking about the weapon and its abilities with how helpful it was, Quinn couldn't deny the strength of a celestial weapon. Which meant it could turn out to be a great skill after all.

"Though, what should I test it on? I could use it on basic weapons, but it would be a waste of celestial points."

"It would be best to use a Demon tier item to put the marking on. Although it will take up a lot of celestial points, it will be worth it."

"Besides that, I don't know if it will affect the current capabilities of the weapons I have on me."

"The gauntlet, Blue fang set, and chest piece are quite unique pieces. I also wanted to give more celestial points to the others."

"I know there is a limit to their bodies with how much they could hold, but perhaps I should try and maximise their strength before doing any of this weapon marking business."

"What's the problem? Maybe I can help?" Logan asked.

Hearing this, Quinn explained the skill to the latter because Logan sometimes could think more directly than Quinn and truly pick what he thought was the best option.

"Well, I was going to tell you this anyway, but feel free to keep the Demon tier amulet. It was yours in the first place. I kept it here because it's quite a dangerous item to have."

"And at the same time, it isn't something that others could quickly figure out what to do with it if they just held it in their hands."

"I don't know if the item's size has any relevance, but it might do, so why not try it on the amulet, see what it can do," Logan suggested.

Thinking about it, even if he lost the abilities of the Amulet, Quinn knew he wouldn't be so crushed, so it wasn't a bad choice, and he was planning to give it to Lucia anyway.

If it did grant great power, it would be a good boost to her strength if she continued to travel with them.

"Thank you, Logan. You continue to help me out as always. It wasn't just me that took down Graham and the rest of the Dalki, it was all of us. At some point, I hope everyone can get credit."

Quinn said, as he went to find the others and see what being a celestial meant.
