# Chapter 1840: I'm in a rush! (Part 2)

Right now, looking at the man standing on the ship Yanny's blood was beyond boiling point. He had no clue who this person was but it was clear that they weren't a Mermerial, just like the one before.

It was twice now that someone had come in and interrupted his plans. They had significantly changed the flow of everything that was going on, this was also the exact problem that Yanny was talking about. The reason why he wanted to take over the race and focus on strength, so outsiders of different races couldn't affect them.

Rather than suppressing the great powers they had, they should have empowered them. The only thing was after that one attack, Yanny was unsure how powerful this person was.

Ignoring the crashing ship, the fight with the others soon continued, the remaining predators were going for the Dalki, while the remaining few were going after Sil. Now that Quinn was here, he didn't want to waste any more time at all.

Yanny had practically blinked for a second, and Suddenly Quinn was no longer in his sights, Instead, he was holding onto one of the other predators.

[Skill celestial drain is being used]

In one hand, he held a Predator by the head, in the other, he was controlling his blood to attack the remaining others. Then when finally drained, Quinn had gathered two blood rifles in both of his hands, aimed carefully and fired it out killing the other two predators that were fighting against the other Dalki.

The celestial energy that he got from the predators wasn't worth his time.

"Who is that person..." People who were still hiding in the city asked.

"They just killed the predators with ease. This makes no sense?"

Now that they had all been dealt with, there was only one more to go.

"You know, I could have taken them all out as well?" Sil asked. "You try fighting in the water, while looking after everyone at the same time."

"I know you could have Sil. It seems you took a lot on your shoulders this time." Quinn stated and looked toward Yanny who had taken a step back.

"Wait!" Princess shouted, slamming her trident into the ground.

"Please Quinn. I know you have helped me, all of you have, at my request. But this is something that I need to do. Please, let me deal with him."

The reason why Quinn didn't hold back unlike Sil, was because he felt like they had spent enough time here. Of course, they didn't want to destroy the whole planet and kill innocent lives, but everyone they needed was here.

When looking at Wince, Quinn noticed the trident and gave Sil a look, who just gave an awkward smile back.

"Let her have this one, I think she just might win." Sil winked.

The large ship that had crashed down in the square had taken up half of it, but the other half was clear for the two of them to fight. Dogthus, Sil and Quinn were now watching the outcome.

—— —— ——

The trident was a natural weapon in Wince's hand. She had hardly used a weapon like this before, only swords and others when the royal family would train her. Yet, it felt like an extension of her body.

Even now out of the water it was so light. She continually spun the trident around herself, and then finally thrust it forward toward Yanny shooting out a jet stream of water.

"If you think for a second I'm going to give up now when I was so close, then you are dead wrong!"

Yanny jumped to the side avoiding the strike, it was one of the few times the jet stream of water from the trident had actually avoided him. In his hands, he had also gathered balls of water. Although, they didn't look normal as they moved about.

Immediately he started to throw them toward the princess, one after another. Wince, unsure what these were, had decided to avoid the first one. She jumped back and the second the ball of water touched the ground, it exploded and several splashes of water came out in all different types of directions.

Some of them came towards her but spinning the trident, she was able to block the attack. When spinning the trident a strange blue glow would come out towards it.

Still, several more attacks were coming and hence why she was unable to avoid them all. Eventually one of the water bombs had exploded next to her and she couldn't stop the slashes of water that were going towards her feet. It had caused a big deep cut and her blood was now spilling on the ice.

"The wound is quite deep, I won't be able to move as well as I could before."

Seeing this as an opportunity, creating a larger water bomb combining two of them together Yanny through it towards her again.

Just as it looked like the water bomb was about to hit the ground, she propped herself up ion the trident. Then used it to lift her own body above in the air.

The water bomb had exploded right where the trident was but she knew a weapon like hers could take it.

Pushing off while in the air upside down, she lifted herself as if someone was doing a type of high jump and held the trident in her hand like a spear. Wince's hand was glowing slightly blue as she threw it out, and while in the middle of the air it started to multiply tuning into six different tridents.

With the way they were coming towards Yanny it was impossible for him to avoid them all, and one of the tridents stuck right through his arm. Activating the blue glow around her hand, the trident suddenly appeared right back in her hand again.

"I told you she would do alright, and it looks like she finally learnt how to use the thing, although I can create quite a few tridents, that thing is still better in my hands," Sil said.

"You think this is over don't you, I can tell from the look on your face." Yanny had one of his arms holding the wound applying pressure to it, but in one of the others, was the blue pearl he had been holding the entire time.

"All of you will wish you joined my side." Yanny threw the blue pearl on the floor and it broke. Immediately, a large amount of energy could be felt escaping out of the ball.

Seeing this, Quinn and Sil knew it was celestial energy. The two of them jumped and leapt to where Wince was, as this would no longer be a fair fight.

The sea outside of the ice started to become wild, dark clouds gathered above them all, and the wind began to pick up as well. The people seeing all of this thought that a catastrophe was about to strike.

"Please Yongu, rise and teach all of these fools a lesson, show them why the predators have worshipped you!" Yanny laughed.

The blue mist coming out from the pearl, started to gather into a pure blue energy form. It was starting to make out a shape, a large figure that was a little bigger than Yanny himself.

An outline was starting to appear. It had large wings growing from its back, a face of a sea creature mixed between a shark and an octopus, yet had a figure of a human. When the outline finally finished forming, the blue energy particles dispersed and without a doubt, what they were staring out now, was a god, another Celestial.

Immediately, Yanny bowed down in front of him.

"Oh please, great master, get rid of these fools who wish to take over your planet."

Looking at the creature, there was a shiver in all of the people's spines, and even Wince was taken aback.

"A real God... the god of the sea. The predators really did serve him, it wasn't a rumour after all." Now Wince felt guilty, guilty for bringing these two along, to suffer a cruel death there was nothing they could do.

Yongu was staring at the Celestial having been summoned, he then titled his head down, to look at the so called intruders.

"Who dares disturb my..." Yongu's words were cut short as soon as he laid eyes on the intruders.

There was silence, as he blinked a couple of times, and suddenly got down on his knees.

"Please... please Great Celestial BB, please spare me."

The great god in front of the whole Mermerial race was on his knees begging for his life.

# Chapter 1841: Legendary BB.

Everyone at the scene was so stunned by the actions they were seeing that they had stepped out of their homes and the shelter they were hiding behind. Some of them even rubbed their eyes and pinched themselves, but without a doubt, they weren't dreaming.

The one that was currently bowing down on the ground was a God. Not just any god, but one who looked like a Fishman from the Meremerial race. They knew quite a bit about this God and their powers as their history books have described him well.

He was a powerful being who helped the Meremerial race in tough times, helping the predators of the sea. However, in recent times, he hadn't been seen during the divide, and he had slowly become more of a rumour over the years.

The only thing was, it was clear he was real. Someone had been giving the current predators of today their powers. No one knew whether it was the old God or not, but when they saw him, they knew everything was true.

Something inside their bodies was shaking as they felt his power, so why...why was this powerful and mighty God now bowing down in front of these outsiders? It didn't make any sense.

The thing was, in all honesty, Quinn was also confused by what was happening right now.

"This is a Celestial. I can tell by their energy, but why are they acting like this? I haven't seen this person before." Quinn thought, trying to remember.

"Yongu!" Yanny shouted by his side. He was nervous while looking back and forth between Quinn and his God. "What are you doing? Yongu should not be on your knees! Instead, you should use your great power to eliminate these invaders!"

"You yourself said you would get rid of anyone who came an..." In the middle of his sentence, Yongu stood up and clutched Yanny by his mouth, making him shut up.

"If you dare say another word, I will ensure you never live to see another day. I will not lose my life because of you." A surge of power was brewing all over Yongu as he said this.

His grip let go, and Yanny fell to the ground on his backside. He was so filled with fear that he couldn't even move because he knew that this God could take him out in an instant, which was why it was even more confusing for him that the latter was kneeling on the ground.

Looking at Quinn, he couldn't sense the same amount of energy out of him. This was because Quinn, of course, had his Celestial energy internally and wasn't using it at the moment.

"What do you think we should do?" Sil asked, peeking at the God who had gone to kneel again, almost instantly after dealing with Yanny.

"It's the God-slayer... I was pretty sure it was you, BB, but now that you are with the god slayer, I can confirm you are indeed BB." Yongu stated.

Listening to what this Celestial was saying, Quinn was trying to piece things together. The only ones that knew Quinn as BB were from Celestial Space. Was it from his fight with Athos? Was this celestial one of them that had seen him?

"Quinn." Princess said as she walked forward. "Who are you? How did you make him do something like this?"

"Please!" Yanny finally got the nerve to shout out again. He was in a desperate situation, His last trump card was now not working, and he felt like there had to be some type of mistake. "Explain why you won't fight these two."

For a second, Yongu turned around and glared at Yanny again, but he kept his head down and stayed in his position out of respect for Celestial 'BB' in front of him.

"BB is a god that has been banned from the Celestial Space." Yongu gulped before he went on to the following sentence.

"He is the one that has decided to go against us, against our ways, and fought hundreds of gods at once. Defeating many of them... including me."

Audible gasps spread throughout the crowds. Although they didn't quite know what was going on, without a doubt, the words they heard were impressive. It sounded almost impossible.

Wince's eyes widened, and her hands trembled.

She recalled their conversation at the bar when Quinn claimed to be a God. Although she had used that phrase to describe him a few times, she never meant it in a literal sense, and now she learnt that not only was he telling the truth, but he was perhaps beyond a conventional God.

"Yongu told me about that rampage you went on, but I didn't realise it had this much effect," Sil whispered with his hand covering his mouth.

The truth was, even Quinn didn't know the chaos he had triggered. It was out of anger and desperation that he had done such an act. He never thought that his real-world self would cross over a celestial from that space, at least not this soon.

"I don't even remember killing him in that space, but I was fighting just anything I could see at the time, and in that space, we could only see outlines, not the real figure of the enemies."

"This guy must have never thought he would meet me. He might think I'm here to get revenge to kill them all in real life or something, and they will have to reincarnate?"

"I will not kill you." Quinn said confidently, walking closer to the other.

"Is if you can meet my conditions at least. That man is never to set foot on this planet again."

Quinn pointed towards Yanny. Although Quinn personally had no troubles with him, based on the fight, he knew that was the one that Princess Wince was having trouble with.

"I assume you caused all this mess because it has something to do with your condition. Well, I wish for you to work it out with the new leader. The Princess over here."

Quinn raised his hand toward her.

For some reason, Wince found it quite embarrassing as all eyes were on her, and hearing Quinn say these words, the crowd behind started to cheer.

"Yes, bring back the old Royal family!"

"I can't believe we let that Yanny do as he wished in the first place."

"Look at them." Sil tooted. "All of sudden, they are brave and ready to defend her, but at least it looks like the Princess is happy"

Sil finally could get rid of part of his guilt with this. Although there was one thing that he still wanted and was unwilling to give up, and that was the Trident. It had become his favourite weapon.

He needed to think of some way to convince the Princess to give it back.

"Yes, I can do all those things. My condition will be fine even if I work with the Princess!" Yongu said, banging his head against the floor several times to show his sincerity.

"How could you betray me like that!" Yanni panicked, "I did everything you said. After I've served you for so long, you just toss me aside and..." Yongu had stood up and given a back fist to Yanny. It sent him flying through the city, bypassing every building and eventually, he fell into the deep sea.

"He is still alive, but if he carries on, he will definitely not bring you any trouble. Forgive him. He is one of my dedicated followers of mine." Yongu explained.

It seemed things were going well, but all of the requests Quinn had made so far were for the others and not for him, now came the moment of truth, and he was hoping for a useful answer.

"Finally, as long as you keep these promises, I will not kill you in any way or form, and in fact, I will help you when need be, but I wish for you to return me and my friend to the Earth." Quinn requested.

So far, they have had no such luck. Athos had disagreed because it would mean going against the other celestials, but how would they know where he was at that time unless they were checking every star they could find.,

At the same time, Quinn was gambling.

In front of him was a Celestial who feared him more than the others.

"I... I... I... I agree to the deal. I will return both you and your friend to Earth."

# Chapter 1842: Stronger Sides.

Sailing through the endless sea was the giant mesh of equipment put together to create the almighty Ship, known as Rein, a suitable name given by the Pure faction. It continued to swim through the sea as it always did.

The Ship itself never anchored near land, as there was always smaller freight of battleships that would be used to complete the trade-going from the giant ship Rein to the smaller places that Pure had their base on.

There were two new members who had been here for a while now, and they received a grand treatment on board the Ship. Erin and Flora were staying in the same room on the Ship Rein.

They were on the very top floor of the Ship, which was reserved for agents Four, One and Zero themselves. There were powerful friends that would help them at times and were allowed on the top floor, but these floors were generally for the leaders of Pure.

Either way, there were not many arguments about these two new quests. For one, the public was unaware of what had transpired. They had no clue about the red vampires, nor did they know that the Dhampirs had almost been annihilated.

To them, the world continued to exist as it always had. At the same time, the higher ranking members in Pure had always believed they were working with the Dhampirs on the side anyway, this was now more of a direct relationship, and they could do with having such strong forces on their side.

Agent Four himself was just pleased that he had a new toy to play with, figuring out how the blood crystal would work or specific ways he could use it. The only one that seemed to be unhappy about the whole thing was Chris.

However, his word could never go above Agent O's. In the end, no one in Pure was loyal to him. They were all devoted to Zero because he could give them what they wanted.

Currently, Erin and flora were not in their rooms but instead on the outside in the fresh and open. On the very top of the Ship, above the floor where they would stay, there was a landing pad.

This was designed for spaceships to come and land on, although not many did come, so it doubled up as a training place as well. With permission, Zero had granted access to Erin and Flora to use it.

The space was large, almost the size of around three football fields. The ground was also solid, allowing them to train to their hearts extent.

Erin held onto the large Ice blade with the flame grip. The demon-tier weapon that initially belonged to Oscar was now in her hands. She charged forward and held the giant longsword down her side.

Lifting it, she swung it down, with a large force of Qi, crashing into Flora's blade. An explosion was heard, and smoke filled the area of the two, but looking out the end of the other side was Flora, and in her hand was the legendary sword that belonged to Arthur.

"Your weapon is a strong one, but you can't just rely on it. Stop thinking so much about using all the powers the sword has." Erin lectured.

"Remember everything you have learnt, and try to use your ability and the sword. Do not forget, the weapon you hold in your hand is not the only weapon you can use!"

Hearing this, Flora then threw out a yellow aura slash with her own hand rather than the sword, while at the same time, using the string ability, she swung the sword out toward Erin.

The only thing was, with her bare hands, Erin knocked the yellow aura away into the sky while using her sword to block the incoming sword.

The training between the two of them continued at an intense rate and watching it all was Zero from one end of the large platform. There was a viewing deck-a place where people went on after landing for snacks, drinks and more.

From time to time, events would be held on the large platform, with stands as such up here. The room they were in would be used as a dressing room for the ones putting on a show.

Today though, like many days, Zero was a spectator with Chris by his side.

"What do you think?" Zero asked.

"They are strong." Chris replied.

"They have good weapons, and that Queen of theirs has a ridiculous amount of Qi that could be measurable to mine."

"Although, to be honest, I doubt she has gone all out in any of these training sessions against that little pupil of hers."

"However, we already knew she was strong when she defeated Laxmus, which is why I'm telling you to be careful. Do not underestimate her just because she came here to ask for help."

Zero continued to watch for a while, as he was fascinated at the two of them fighting before giving a reply.

"If we are to start an all-out war against our enemy. then we have to be prepared for all those who will or might intervene to help those people."

"Logan Green, Jake Green, The Blade family, Andy, from the Vampire Corps, Quinn Talen and his damned Gang."

"There is even the Dalki-looking one that fought against you. I also do not doubt that the Graylash family, whom I push came to shove, would get involved on their side as well."

"Currently, as things are, although people see both sides as even, it's only because we have the majority support of the people. So if they make a move, they will be seen as ruthless and power hungry."

"The people will think they are the ruthless ones who will do anything to get their way, simultaneously destroying us, the logical and fair ones. Bringing these two on board is a must."

Chris understood what Zero was saying. It was why they had tried so hard to get the Chained on their side before things had messed up. However, these days, now that the dhampirs were with them, Chris was wondering if there was another way.

"Based on everything I just said, Agent Four and I will leave for a while. A planet with a suspected nest of demon-tier beasts has been discovered."

"Their weapons and power will do well to improve our forces if we do go into a fight." Zero explained. "Which means you will be in charge of this entire ship while I am away."

The look on Chris's face showed he was surprised, this was unexpected, and he hardly knew Zero to go off like this.

"Wait, aren't those from the Green city coming here soon? Will you be away for that as well?"

"Correct." Zero nodded.

"Without a doubt, they will think the meeting is a trap. But, with my presence gone, maybe they will feel at ease. As for what you wish to do in this meeting, I will leave it up to you."

"Talk about working together, bridging connections, give and take of land and power. Whatever it takes just to delay them into thinking we won't act any time soon."

Just then, they heard a loud bang, and the whole top floor started to shake. When looking out the glass window, they could see it was from the two training, and flora was on the ground, severely injured.

"What about the two? You don't expect me to hide them, do you?" Chris asked.

"If those from Green City see them, they will immediately think that this is a trap. In fact, they might start fighting us right here, trying to get rid of us all!"

A smile appeared on Zero's face as if he was expecting that response.

"Don't worry about them. They won't be here either. They will be coming with me."

"Since they will be working closely with us, it only makes sense for us to work closely together on this."

"Besides, I plan to clarify who works for whom in this treachery." Zero answered.

***

# Chapter 1843: A Great Teacher.

Once again, the most advanced stealth fighter ship from Green city was being used. It was the same one as the group had used when travelling to the Red Vampire base, only this time they were heading to a place that was probably equally as dangerous for those onboard.

Although the general public would never see it that way.

They were going to the Pure base, the large ship known as Rein. The coordinates had been sent to them. Because it was almost impossible to find the ship without them. The ship would communicate with the bases they had on land, and it was the same if anyone wanted to immigrate to the main ship.

They would have to ask about it at one of the few Pure Shelters that were set up around earth and a few other places on the other planets on the Milkey Way galaxy.

As for the ship itself, without the coordinates, there were claims that it was untrackable. It seemed like. over the course of a 1000 years, there were those that were able to create technology that could catch up with the great Logan Green.

Or at least after all this time, they had ways of countering him.

This time, the group was not as large as it was before, as there were many that had left the group to pursue their own thing. Vorden and Borden had gone back to the Blades. They were on standby in case anything was to happen, and at the same time, Logan said bringing them to the pure base would be trouble.

Hannah was no longer with them helping out those at the Red Vampire base. Vincent, had yet to wake up, but rather than sit around and do nothing they wanted to do something which led them to where they were right now.

There was no longer Jake either. On his father's advice, it would be best not to send him.

In truth, Logan wanted to go with them, and if he could he would have sent Jake like he did when they went to the Red Vampire base, but this was meant to be a civil meeting. There was no threat to be made from either side.

A leader couldn't just go to the base of the other side, it was dangerous for them. Even if the leader was killed, the other side could blame it on some extremist assassin, even if they were the ones that hired them.

In fact, Logan had claimed even through all his meetings with those at Pure, he had never met Zero himself. The only one he would stay in contact with was Agent 4. The Great scientist of Pure.

Which was why sending a group of misfits would be okay.

Currently, on board, were Muka, Jessica, Lucia, Peter, Mitchell and finally Minny. All of them were at a meeting around a cheap metal table. Apparently, Mitchell brought it on board with him so they could have more efficient meetings.

Minny had even got her own seat, and she slammed her two fists on the table.

"Okay, so how are we going to solve this!" Minny said.

Although the girls seemed to find it cute and adorable, Mitchell was slapping his forehead.

"Who thought it was a good idea to bring a little girl into enemy territory, why didn't we just leave her at Green City, surely she would have been safer there," Mithcell complained.

"Hey, she saved my life." Lucia argued back. "Minny is more than capable, besides, it was Peter who decided to bring her along."

Mitchell looked at Peter hoping for a reasonable answer, the thing was, from this person he wasn't really expecting one.

"If anything happened to her, how do you think Quinn would react?" Peter replied.

"Do you really think she is safer in Green city, with a person who doesn't really know her, or right by my side?"

It certainly was a good case surprisingly, Mitchell couldn't argue with that, and certainly not when the strongest person on this ship without a doubt was Peter. Although no one saw him as the leader, instead that role had naturally gone to someone else.

Controlling this entire meeting was none other than Muka.

"There are two key points that we have to remember about this meeting" Muka began to explain. "For one, we are officially going to apologise about losing the Red Heart."

"No doubt they know that the Green family was involved in the attack by the Red Vampires due to Jake Green's display of his abilities. Logan wishes for us to talk about how both of our groups can move forward from this."

"Remember, that Pure has been working with the dhampirs as well so this will be a difficult task, but we are not to initiate or start a war."

"Whatever the case please try to keep your fists to yourself. If we start a fight while visiting on behalf of the Green's we will lose the people's trust."

Everyone nodded showing they understood, but they all soon turned their heads to Peter, including Minny.

"I will try, but self defence must be an option," Peter replied.

"That is acceptable." Muka then gave a nod toward.

Mitchell, as she wanted him to keep an eye on Peter, and be the one to calm him down, or reason with him when it came to it. This was probably the hardest task that anyone had.

"Great, as for the second task, the true reason why we are visiting is to find out if they can give us any information about when Leo, and Sera attacked 1000 years ago."

Lucia, scrunched up her forehead as she was trying to think.

"How, are we going to do that exactly, I mean, it seems like the whole attack wasn't exactly a good experience for them. It's as if we are going to apologise and then ask them for a favour."

"They might be okay." Mitchell replied.

"Pure are more Civil than people think, and have been for a while. They only act a certain way towards vampires to get support from the people.

"Honestly, at this point, we don't really know if we have another goal other than winning a general election to be put into power."

"So asking them a few questions about the past might not be a big deal, we just need to get to the right person."

"So as a green, we are to find out what happened to Leo the last time he was attacked," Muka said and once again they all nodded.

"I have a question." Jessica said, raising her hand shyly as if she was in the middle of school.

"Can you please tell us, who was this Leo person? Why is he so important to the Dhampir Queen? Can one man really make such a difference?"

His was actually a question that many wanted to ask, but the main person Quinn wasn't there to answer.

"For me, he was a powerful Vampire knight. He worked for Quinn as his second in command and looked after those in the tenth."

"At one point there was a large attack from the Blood suckers and he had managed to survive until the king came, which is a grand feet itself."

"He also got the name of 'Armlobber', but I can't remember why."

That had explained a bit about Leo's life in the vampire world but there had to be more.

"Leo, wasn't always a vampire," Peter answered.

"He was a teacher at the school first, and he was someone who was turned by Quinn. Before he was even turned though he had helped us a number of times."

"He never seemed to follow rules, set form above and always just followed his own rules. Whatever he believed in. I don't know the full story."

"Erin had become Leo's pupil of a sort. The two of them had worked together for a long time. She seemed to respect him, do anything he said."

"That's why we need to know what had such an impact on her life, whether it was Leo's death, or something else that we don't know."

The others thought of the man who taught the Dhampir Queen, they had already seen how strong Erin was in combat, her swordsmanship was not to be laughed at. It was difficult for them to imagine the person mentioned or what they would look like.

While everyone was left with their thoughts, a beeping sound was heard. Turning around through the large glass pane window, they could see it, the enormous ship known as Rein.

***

# Chapter 1844: Pure Army!

As the spaceship hovered down to land on top of the Grand Rein, nervousness gripped some of the people on the ship. After all, they were on the opposing side, voicing against the beliefs of Pure.

Never in their entire lives did they believe that they might end up going to the heart of the Pure base. At the same time, they had no clue what they were expecting either.

When landing and getting off the ship, they found about fifteen people in light brown clothing waiting for them. Other than them, a couple wore a white overcoat and had a unique number embedded on the back of the coat.

"Even after all this time, they're still doing that type of stuff?" Peter frowned.

They were coming in on the very top deck, and that's when they noticed something strange. Several deep scrapes, burnt spots, and more were all over the large platform.

"It looks like someone attacked the Rein ship recently," Lucia commented.

"I wonder who it was. Does Pure have enemies other than the Greens?"

"I wouldn't be too surprised," Mitchell replied.

"There have been cases of people who defected from the Vampire Corps to go after other vampires and even Pure."

Although Muka didn't say anything, she found the markings and scratches to be quite strange. The way the strikes and the attacks were and how distanced the marks were. It didn't seem like an attack from a ship or spaceship of some sort.

—— —— ——

As the ship landed, each of them walked down the ramp and standing in front of them were two men in White overcoats, one with the number 13 and the other with the number 15.

By their side, there was the normal fighting force of the Pure base, in a type of brown clothing with pieces of Blue armour on certain parts of their body.

"Welcome those of you from Green city!" The man with the number 13 announced. He had quite long hair, which were dyed in a shade of dark green and eyes that were a bit wide like a snake.

"Yes, send the most untrustworthy-looking person to greet us," Jessica whispered under her breath.

"Today, me, number 13 and 15, will be showing you around our Country, Rein. We will then have a nice meal together, and after that, your trip will conclude with a meeting with our leaders. Our leaders are getting ready for the meeting." 13 said with a smile while rubbing his hands together.

Getting ready didn't sound good to them. They were more afraid that they were setting up a trap. What would one need to get ready for if they were just going to have a talk? Regardless, if they were taking them around the ship, which was known as Pure's country, then there would be plenty of witnesses if they were to do anything.

"We accept your offer," Muka said, wearing a balaclava that covered up half of her mouth, only showing the top of her face and her eyes.

However, even then, nearly all the men that set eyes on her for a second started to blush and look away.

"I hope the meal that you have planned is suited for all of our tastes. It would be a bit of a problem if I were to go hungry." Muka said with her eyes slightly glowing red.

She made it clear to them all that she was a vampire, but it didn't have the effect she quite wanted.

"Please just bite me instead! You can have all my blood!" A man shouted, and his subordinate slapped him on the back of the head.

It was awkward between everyone for a moment after that, but to break the ice, agent 13 started to move, asking the rest to follow. There were four guards in the group at all times, but they gave them their space.

It was obvious the guards weren't there to keep them in line, these people could do nothing against Peter, and Peter had become somewhat of a known figure after the video had gone viral, revealing his strength.

On the ship itself, there were giant elevators that would go through the various floors. On top of that, it didn't just go up and down but went backwards, forwards, left and right as well.

They had preset routes to take one to all the different places around the ship. There was even a metro train system on the ship as well that could be used to take you to different spots.

The first place they were escorted to looked like an entire village. There were houses, long green fields and shops and supermarkets on the ship itself. Then when continuing their tour, they were taken to what looked like a shopping street on board the ship.

From leisure facilities to everything else, it was as if Pure had spent all their budget on this giant ship in the middle of the sea. Of course, Green City was just as impressive, but it was just interesting to see the other factions do something different with the resources.

Lucia and Jessica could imagine living in either Green city or on the Rein. The only thing was, for those like them, it was impossible. It made them feel upset in a way. If Pure chose to accept vampires, then perhaps there would just be great places on the Earth that people could visit.

After showing them all the impressive locations of the ship, they were starting to head closer to the upper floors, and what they had come across when stepping out of the elevator this time was a training field.

It looked like a giant wasteland with facilities scattered around the place: break rooms, equipment and different training areas. On one side, there was a group of people sitting down crossed-legged. The instructor was standing, explaining how they should feel their Qi in the centre of their body.

In another area, there were those who fought and jumped, sometimes with their bare hands, sometimes with weapons, striking chi here and there, and finally, which was the strangest thing for Peter, there were simulators with machine guns.

They were firing bullets out at targets while moving in formations. They looked like normal bullets, but those that had dealt with Qi before and had seen them knew they weren't. They were bullets filled with Qi. Either the bullets themselves were different, or it was the gun they were holding onto.

"Pure, they have more soldiers than I thought, and this is just the main ship, not including all of the small cities." Mitchell thought.

These weapons are impressive and have been a problem for us for a while because they make even the weakest person into a deadly machine that can kill.

In a way, if Pure asked all of its civilians to raise their firearms, they would have a fighting chance. It's important that we aren't seen as the aggressor; otherwise, the people will hold up these weapons and go against us.

They stayed and watched the army train for a while. It looked like 13 was trying to do something by showing them such a place.

"What do you think? Our forces are quite strong, right?" 13 asked.

"Ha." Peter laughed out loud, saying that. "None of the people here could even beat this little girl if they were to try."

As for who he was referring to as the little girl, it was Minny. And upon hearing this, she smiled and raised her hand to make a little bicep to show her muscle. Although they were non-existent.

Those training nearby had stopped to take a look, and it was the same for 13 as well.

"Your army is very strong." Mitchell interrupted.

"The two of them are just kids who are proud of their own strength. Just ignore what they say."

Peter took offence to that, but before he could say anything, Lucia grabbed his arm and shook her head. For some reason, Peter seemed to stop right there.

"Alright, that's enough showing you all around, it's time for you to have your meal, and I have been informed that the meeting will commence there as well."

# Chapter 1845: A strange smell.

Following both Agent 13 and 15, they were led into an elevator once again. But this time, unlike the going up, down, left or right elevator they had seen before, this one took them directly up instead, to the second highest floor on the ship.

It seemed to be a locked floor, as Agent 13 had used a special pass when accessing the elevator; both Mitchell and Muka seemed to be making a note of everything going on. Mainly because there was a chance they could be returning to the ship one day, but not as Allies. Information was key in times of battle.

When the doors opened, an amazingly breathtaking view appeared in front of them. Walking out of the elevator, Jessica and Lucia were the most excited. This place looked like a restaurant with glass panels, and since it was at the peak of the Rein, one could view the whole ship from it.

Looking out, one could see the beautiful sight of the sea, and even a part of the ship could be seen, with people outside enjoying themselves and more. It was a pretty peaceful place, and unfortunately, the more they saw of it, the less some of them felt the need to attack such an area.

"This is where we will be having our meal for the day." 13's words pulled them out of their trance, and they all sat around a large round table.

There was enough room for all of them, but Agents 13 and 15 didn't sit next to each other. Instead, there was a seat left empty. Which they assumed was for whom they would be meeting today, Zero.

"We have been informed that we should go ahead and enjoy a meal without him for now." Agent 13 stated, looking towards the empty seat, and noticing that every one was uneasy for their guest.

The group decided to wait and save their questions for later. After all, they wanted to know about Leo, and to do that, they needed to speak to someone who was here 1000 years ago, whether that be Chris or Zero himself, but it certainly wasn't these unknown faces.

Several staff were assigned in the room, as many as there were people, and they were there to serve each individual person's needs. Giving them drinks and offering snacks.

"We decided to serve alcohol to you all, as we believe that even vampires can taste that, correct?" Agent 13 said.

In a Champagne glass, alcohol was being served to all, and the group found it quite delightful, including Lucia, who wasn't a vampire. It was truly a drink that could be enjoyed by them all.

"Ahh, not that, Minny," Jessica said as she pushed it away.

"Why! That's not fair. Why is everyone else allowed to drink it but not me!" Minny complained.

"Because... because you're still a child. It will affect your body quicker than everyone else's, even if you are a vampire." Jessica explained.

"Huh, but I'm not a child. Peter said that I was older than you!" Minny replied back.

They all knew the situation of Minny after Peter told them about it, but even though 1000 years had passed, Minny's body was still that of a child. In the shadow space, time slowed down to the point as if nothing happened in the real world.

"Please, I promise you can have all the juice boxes that you would like, but not this," Jessica insisted, which seemed to have calmed down Minny a bit. Regardless, she still folded her arms and pouted to show her anger.

"Look at all of this," Lucia commented quietly.

"Isn't Pure the group meant to try to make things equal for everyone? By teaching everyone Qi and ensuring no one has different abilities and such?

"Yet, their treatment when it comes to money, power and other luxuries like this isn't the same."

It seemed like agent 15, who had been quiet this whole time, had managed to hear what Lucia had said. Lucia had to admit, he was a handsome man with straight hair and strong eyebrows. He placed his hand under his chin as he smiled at her.

"You, you're not like the others, are you? I can tell if I was to take a guess judging from the robes you're wearing, you're part of the Graylash family."

"If history serves me right, didn't your ancestors attempt the same thing in the past?"

"To bring equality in the world by giving everyone the power of lightning? And because of it, they have started a whole Civil war!"

Lucia clenched her teeth as she knew about the past of her family. It was an argument used many times against the Graylash family when trying to paint them in a bad light.

"Yes, please deflect the current situation with something that was done in the past," Lucia commented, "If you remember history well, then you should also remember that Owen Graylash also changed his views after that."

"The Civil war simply started due to the disagreement of the way things were run. Owen was also someone who gave his life to the Hero Quinn and more. Yet what did the Pure do while the Dalki were taking over us?"

"You're missing my point," Agent 15 stated.

"As you said, the Graylash family changed, and it is the same for our group as well. The way it's currently set up is because it needs to be this way for the current way of the world."

"But once we can implement our ideals and have a structure in place, we will make it so everyone gets to live the best life they possibly can. Do you think the people below are unhappy?"

Again, Lucia had to bite her lip because, without a doubt, the people here didn't look unhappy at all.

"Please, we should save the political discussions for later." Muka dispersed the argument.

"The ideals are just different. I think neither is wrong or right. We just have different ways, methods and beliefs. There is no point in trying to convince the other. So let's just enjoy ourselves."

Just then, the waiters had returned and placed a plate in front of everyone. Since it had a silver lid over them, they were unable to see their food. However, the smell wafted into their noses when he lifted the lid.

It was a nice steak dinner meal, and for the vampires, the meal was cooked extremely raw; basically blue with it seared a little bit. Peter looked at the meal, and although he could eat it, it wasn't really something that his type was meant to eat, but for now, he would dig into it anyway.

As everyone got on with their meals, there was one that seemed to feel like their food was a bit bland, and in truth, for the vampires, it was, but they knew their guests were just trying to be polite.

"I don't want this, it tastes disgusting!" Minny complained.

"I want my juice. Where is my juice?!"

It was then that agent 13 clicked his fingers. He knew what the juice boxes had inside them and knew what the little girl wanted.

"Not to worry, we have prepared a dessert for everyone. It was just in case our meals today weren't to your liking."

The waiters soon returned, and in their hands, they each had a glass, and the glasses were filled with a red liquid. Everyone instantly knew what it was blood.

When it arrived at the table, Minny looked at it with big eyes. She was delighted at what she was seeing.

However, Muka taking a sniff instantly could tell something was off.

"Stop!" Muka said.

"No one drinks this... it smells similar to human blood, but there's something different about it. What are you thinking of doing to us?" She asked.

The other two were quite surprised by this because, genuinely, they had no clue what she was talking about and just then, a ding echoed in the hall, and the sound of the elevator door opening up came from behind them.

"Is there a problem with my blood?" The man asked as he got off the elevator.

Arriving at the table, he pulled a seat forward. It was undoubtedly none other than Chris, which became obvious from the large number 1 on the back of his white overcoat.

***

# Chapter 1846: Turn around.

Although the sit-in was already tense, the moment Chris stepped into the room, it felt like the air had just gotten heavier. Sitting across from the rest of the group, Chris smiled at each of them.

Seeing Chris, the most unconcerned was Muka. She was more worried about the blood that was in front of her. Lifting the glass, she smelt it again and wondered why it felt so strange.

"What are these people planning?"

In truth, she would have liked to taste the blood, but not on herself in case it caused problems. This moment reminded her of the Dalki blood. It took years before the vampires learned that the Dalki blood was beneficial for them.

"What did you put in this?" Muka eventually asked. "Were you trying to... make us sick?"

"I am sorry about the blood, Chris replied calmly, "I'm not really sure what is suited to a vampire's taste. And, you see, we don't really have many of them around here."

"I thought that blood from a strong person would be more beneficial to you all, and what better person than myself? Also, I don't want to cause problems for the people in Pure. So rather than asking, I volunteered myself, just as a leader would do."

Muka pushed the glass away, and everyone else did the same, following her lead.

"We have come to make an apology on behalf of Logan Green." Muka started the conversation and came directly to the objective without beating around the bush. "Since it is an important matter, we would like to know if Zero himself is coming?"

Although Muka asked this, the situation currently was actually a better one for them. They had no clue what Zero was like or what his reaction would be. According to what they knew, the best way to find the answers they wanted was through Chris.

"It's a shame Quinn isn't here" Chris replied. "I would have really liked to have talked with him again."

The others were surprised by these words, and at the end, Chris pulled a light smile as he continued. "I'm afraid Zero won't be here. He apologizes but feel free to say what you wish."

Muka cleared her throat before she began.

"I have come here to make a report. The Red Vampires, including their Leader Laxmus, had attacked Green City."

"We saw an opportunity to track them down and follow them and also attempted to inform Pure while also pursuing Laxmus."

"In the end, a scuffle had occurred between Jake Green, the dhampirs and the Red vampires, but unfortunately, we could not retrieve the red heart from him."

It was a short message, but now the ball was in Pure's court for what they were to do.

"Tried to inform us?" Agent 13 laughed.

"Is that your excuse? We don't live in the past, and sending a message or even leaving one is quite easy. Pure and the Green family agreed to eliminate the threat and share information, and you deliberately obstructed the from us."

"It was clear that if you did get the red heart, you were planning to keep it for yourselves. Who knows, you might be lying to us now and have already gained the red heart."

Lucia was finding it hard to hold her mouth and decided to speak.

"Wasn't your group also working with the Dhampirs? They were at the Red vampires' base even before us!"

"You're correct." Chris interrupted.

"However, there was a meeting that included Jake Green, giving permission to the Dhampirs to attack the Red vampires. This information wasn't withheld from you, unlike the news of Red Heart."

"You also failed in stopping Laxmus from getting the Red Heart."

"And so did you." Muka replied.

"Like you just said, it was a joint venture, so if the Red Heart wasn't found by one of us, but by Laxmus, doesn't that mean we're both at fault?"

As well as her appearance, Muka had a soft angelic voice that seemed to calm and ease situations and tensions. It looked to be working, although it was uncertain how well it worked with Chris.

"Let me ask you all a question," Chris said as he leaned forward and placed both arms on the table.

"I want to answer honestly, Why are you here? And I don't mean what you are looking to get out of this conversation, but what situation has brought you here to sit opposite me."

There was a silence at the table for a while, and then everyone answered simultaneously, giving a jumble of answers.

"For Green City!"

"The 'Graylash' family."

"For Quinn."

"For Quinn."

"For Quinn."

"For Quinn."

Chris had a large smile on his face once again.

"Good, good, good. I like most of your answers, 13, 15 and all the waiters, you may leave the room."

Agents 13 and 15 raised their eyebrows in surprise, but the order from One was absolute, and they soon got up to leave.

"Make sure no one comes inside here either until I'm done," Chris added.

Jessica and Lucia gulped, thinking that there could be a fight on their hands after everyone left. They were nervous, but with Lucia next to Peter, she was less worried than she would surely have been.

When everyone left, Chris moved from his seat, and everyone chucked a little bit. But Chris didn't attack them and instead started to walk, turning his back towards them as he looked out into the sea.

"I really do like Quinn, and it's a shame he is not here with you all. Otherwise, I think this whole conversation would have gone a lot easier."

"Do you know there was a time when we both trained together? In some ways, I guess you could say he was my pupil." Chris chuckled.

Shaking their heads at this fact, they had already gotten used to Quinn knowing nearly every influential and large figure of the current world powers.

"The fact that Quinn isn't here, I will assume that he didn't want to fight. That man, although he seems calm, if he really wanted something, he wouldn't have been afraid to take on the whole ship for his goal.

"So tell me, why did he send you here?"

The others were wondering whether or not this was the right time for them to ask the question. Yet, Muka felt it was strange for Chris to send the others away. Was it because this was all a trap, or perhaps something else?

"We wish to find out what happened to Leo?" Muka answered. "I'm sure you know the Dhampir Leader Erin was once a friend of Quinn's and a pupil of Leo."

"We believe everything started to change after the latter's death. We want to understand what is going on and help Quinn so he doesn't have to lose any more people. Quinn said you saw what happened to Leo," Peter added.

"This isn't anything to do with Pure. So we hope you can tell us."

Turning around, Chris let out a big sigh.

"I'm afraid you are wrong because this has more to do with Pure than you know. I'm incredibly sorry about Leo's loss; I truly am. Because you see, before he died, the two of us had become friends."

They were wondering if Chris was lying about this fact, but many of them, for one, had no clue who Leo was or weren't around during the time. One thing was for sure, though, that Chris wasn't threatening them at all.

He was showing no aggression or even had his Qi aura restrained. It was as if he wanted to be as open as possible.

"I will tell you about what happened to Leo, but unfortunately, I think it won't help you understand the Dhampir Queen at all, even if I don't understand it, but before that."

"I want to ask you for something and I need you to guarantee it. Your cooperation."

"Cooperation?" Muka frowned.

Chris exhaled deep and said, "I want to work with your group and Quinn to bring Zero down."

***

# Chapter 1847: Travel back a 1000 years!

At the table, they were too stunned to speak. Many thoughts were running through their mind about what Chris had said. He wanted to work with them and Quinn to take down Zero. To them, they could hear the sound of their own voices in their head screaming that it was a trap and rightly so.

"How could we even trust you?" Jessica was the first to speak up.

"I mean, these guys might have known you before, and you might have known Quinn before, but even then I would say they wouldn't be able to trust you!"

"She does raise a fair point." Muka added but was least surprised when she heard this. When she saw that the others had been asked to leave the room, in her head, this was one of the possibilities that could occur.

"You are Agent 1 of Pure. The second in command of the entire group. In fact, even now you are in front of us as the leader of Pure currently."

"Not only this, but you have been Rank 1 of Pure for as long as we know the organisation has existed. So why... why now of all times would you choose to suddenly turn against your leader?"

"You should also understand that the fact that you have mentioned this to us, means that unless you have a good reason, it will be just as easy for you to turn your backs on us one day."

Chris slowly sat back down in his seat, as he looked into everyone's eyes directly.

"My life has been complicated from the beginning." Chris answered, speaking slowly. Everything he was about to say, was heavy to him.

"My connection to Zero is similar to a fatherly figure. He treated me better than any other father I had before."

"He raised me from young, feeding me and teaching me to fight to get stronger, but there was a strange look in his eyes."

"Although I saw him as my father, it did not feel the same way. He never once praised me no matter what I did for him, no matter how long I stayed by his side."

"But I didn't care about any of this because I was raised with a single purpose, to kill his student, Leo. I thought, maybe if i completed this task of his, maybe then he would finally praise me."

Who Zero was and why he had created Pure was a mystery to many. The one that knew most about Leo and Chris was Peter since he had been informed by Quinn, but even he found this part of the tale confusing.

"From what I know, Leo was one of Zero's best students in the past. But because of him, all of his fellow students, his family and the entire village had died."

"However, Leo was also seen like a son in Zero's eyes. At the time, although he blamed Leo, there was no way he could kill one of his own son's."

"However, as time went on, this anger started to grow inside him. There was torment as he had dreams of his family reaching out to him. All while Leo himself had been hailed a hero, the Blind Swordsman."

"By the time he had summoned the will to kill Leo, he had grown old. His body wasn't like it used to be so he searched out for someone he could raise to do the task for him, and that was me." Chris explained.

"At the moment, the two of you sound like great friends." Mitchell commented, and the others agreed. They were wondering just how Chris words would turn this tale around.

"That part of the story will come later." Chris replied.

"For you to understand everything and for you to believe that I truly wish to get rid of Zero, you need to understand from the beginning."

"Everyday, I heard tales of his fellow students that he had trained at the temple, but the one he talked most about was Leo."

"Although Zero had committed to taking out Leo, when he talked about him, it was always in a soft gentle tone and in a good light."

"It left me confused, my emotions strange. For me it was almost like listening to a father who had another son, a son he was extremely proud of. Before Leo, Zero had a bigger hatred for another, and that was the government. The military force in charge."

"They were the ones that had forced them into this war and had sent no help whatsoever when their whole village had been attacked."

"Along his journeys, he ran into a woman named Lucy. She too had a hatred for the world. A man with a higher ability had forced himself upon her, and in doing so she had been left pregnant with a child."

Peter's eyes lit up when he heard this. Lucy was Layla's mother. And although they had heard from Agent 2 of this fact, Layla was always unsure if it was true or not. As to why, it was because her mother had treated her like trash all those years.

"This... is probably something I should keep to myself." Peter thought.

"Using her strength, her passion, and her ideal of getting rid of the abilities and systems of the world, Lucy, Zero, and I created Pure."

"We were the beginning of the organisation of Pure. During this time, Zero had taught Lucy how to use Qi. Lucy grew fast and was talented."

"On top of that, she had revealed a skill she was able to do that Zero was not, to directly control Life force Qi."

"I didn't notice it then, but looking back on it now, that was when Zero's views and actions started to change."

"Zero has been able to live this long thanks to the life steal. I'm not an idiot and as to the people he has used it on... well, although he has never kept it a secret from me, I never agreed with it."

"You see, me and him never had the same views. I was only raised to do one thing, to fight against Leo. To do his bidding for him, like some type of avatar or puppet he used to pull strings."

"I was fine with that though, it was my part of the deal for being looked after. But now with his life back, his body getting younger, he could begin to do things himself."

"The people Zero started to bring into the group, Lucy didn't agree with, as their views didn't align with hers, there was internal fighting at Pure and eventually, Lucy's position got weaker within the organisation that she had started."

"Still, I followed the person who I saw as my father and for the first time, on the battlefield while fighting against a Dalki, I met Leo. He was just as great as Zero had said he was, perhaps even better."

"If we were on our own, then I believe both of us would have died that day. There was a good feeling I felt, fighting by the side of someone I had heard about so long, to defeat an enemy together."

"I enjoyed that feeling and for the first time I felt like... I had a family."

"I know it's stupid and I'm sure Leo didn't feel that way, but it was why I couldn't bring myself to attempt to do what Zero had trained me for all those years, not yet anyway, not until I could continue to experience this feeling."

"I guess it was after that, I started to feel lost within the organisation. My whole life, I had been raised to kill someone."

"Yet, I felt happy when being with them? Could you even imagine how I felt at the time, how confused I was?"

"I know it may not sound like a difficult life to many, but to me, It was hard to just live with myself everyday. Feelings of betraying my father, feelings of having no goal, no self worth."

"I was already at a turning point, but only later did I find out what Zero was planning, what he felt all this time, and only after Leo, whom I call my brother and friend, died."

"Before I continue, I will ask you again. I need you on my side because in this fight against Zero, I will be on my own."

"None of Pure will follow me. The reason why I haven't acted is because I have needed support."

There was silence between everyone and they looked at Muka for an answer.

"We will need to hear what you have to say about Leo first. As we said, Quinn isn't here, so it will be up to us." Muka replied.

"Very well." Chris said.

"To find out what happened to Leo, we have to go back to Earth around a 1000 years ago, when the attacks from Sera and him started."

***

# Chapter 1848: Leo and Sera. (Part 1)

At the time the current situation on Earth was that Pure had taken over nearly all of the Shelters. They had secretly taken out the big suits behind the scenes that were in charge of multiple important resources, resources that were needed for human society to function. One such type had factories that dealt with 'Glathrium', one of the strongest materials that existed. Because of this, at the same time, Pure were able to do an attack from within and the outside.

They now controlled the military, the Earthborn group that was once protecting the Shelters and Earth. People had no idea who they were really following, but in the end, all roads led to the one known as Pure, and the one behind it, was none other than Zero.

Because of this, two people had been given a task, a task to slowly reclaim back earth from them. Leo and Sera. Leo was one of the most trustworthy men that Quinn knew and on top of that, he had experience working with the military and plenty of battle tactics.

On the other hand, Sera had connections with plenty of powerful unranked travellers, people who didn't wish to get involved in the Dalki and civil war. In the end, though, they were now all fighting to get their home back.

Even if Quinn had successfully defeated Graham, if there was no home to come back to, then it would be a loss for them all. Which was why Leo's and Sera's task was just as important.

On top of the troops that Sera had, Leo was given the vampire soldiers. Ashley, who led them, Paul's men from before were helping in the fight as well.

After much discussion between the two, Leo quickly found out what Sera was capable of. When looking at a map of the entire Earth and the current shelters, it looked like he already knew the big ones to hit first.

Currently, the two of them were on board one of the Bertha ships. All of their army was ready for combat; it was just a discussion of tactics that was needed for both of them.

"We are outnumbered in this fight." Sera said, putting it simply when we put numbers against numbers.

"If we were just up against Pure, then our numbers would be quite even, but they have managed to control the whole military. I wouldn't be surprised if under their web, they have some Traveller groups as well."

"So we have to think our army will dwindle as we continue on this fight. No matter what, but we have to lessen the amount of people that we are fighting against."

Placing his finger on the map, Sera had pointed to one of the biggest Shelters, and on top of that, it was where one of the Big Five used to own.

"This city here has the biggest Mecha factory that Earth created." Sera explained. "Although they aren't a problem for either of us, I suggest we make one of these places our targets."

"It stops the people who can't fight from fighting back, and if we hit their resources first, there hold on the people will be lost. That's when it's another game altogether."

Leo was nodding as he heard all of this.

"It also means that these places will be the most guarded as well. It will be the hardest to go against." Leo replied.

"Correct, but we have the element of surprise. If we start fighting back, taking small Shelters here and there one at a time, then they know we'll be coming for them and they have time to prepare.

"Right now, they think we are too distracted by the Dalki war. Sure, we could go the other route, try to build up a resistance to fight back, but we only need to do that if we aren't confident we can take down the big bases."

"I'm confident enough, but for this to work, we need to take out two of them at the same time to have the most impact. So my question is to you, can you do it?" Sera asked,

Leo gripped his sword, and started to walk away from the map.

"I'll get my people ready."

—— —— ——

After the meeting was over, the two biggest cities on Earth that had a play in the Big Five were targeted. Sera would focus on one, while Leo would focus on the other one. The attack had to be coordinated so support couldn't be sent over. They needed to go in with a big blast.

Both of them had the same tactic to start. At first, only one of them would sneak into the city. With plenty of normal citizens, that wasn't hard to do. With the portable teleports that Logan had given them, they just had to turn them on to allow the chaos to begin.

Leo and the vampire soldiers started to attack; they knew which places would be heavily secured. At the same time what could possibly be used against them. Just like Sera said, the attack was quick and swift.

Leo slashed and went from one person to the next not showing any mercy because he knew that if he allowed them to live, then it meant an ally dying. There was also the chance for them to use someone against him.

They continued forward and Leo had entered some type of base. This was the manufacturing plant where all the Glathrium was made. Entering the main factory, he was there alone.

There were mechanical parts being used to shape and cut the Glathrium. They used Glathrium drills to cut other pieces of Glathrium since it was the easiest material to use on itself. Standing there in front of him were Agents with numbers 16, and 17 on their coats.

"Oh, the Blind Swordsman!"Agent 17 Said. "We have heard a lot about you. Some of us have even seen videos about you. You seem to be quite skilled, but let's see if you can match up to us."

Immediately, the two of them started to shake all over and their bodies began to turn red.

"I have seen this before... It was the same as Chris. Their bodies will be almost twice as strong as they were before."

The next second, both of them dashed toward Leo. Leo pulled out a red colored blade and swiped it in a single motion. He had parried the sword of Agent 17, knocking it back with his own Qi, and then hit the blade of agent 16 as well.

As soon as they were knocked back, with his other hand, Leo swiped it across their chest with his fingers pointed. It was just his bare hand, there was no weapon in it, but he still had drawn blood from the other.

Out of anger, agent 16 started to attack again, but Leo was able to use his hand to deflect his sword and then with the other hand, he twirled it around, redirecting its attack to the ground. Now that his back was turned, Leo used his free arm to stab right through 17's back.

"You both have strong Qi. You have trained well, but I can see your movements with my abilities. I can combine my Qi with my blood powers. I carry more weight in my responsibilities compared to you." Leo said.

Pulling his hand out, it looked like agent 17 was dead. Agent 16 in a rage started to swing widely and Leo continued to deflect it with his hand rather than his blood weapon. It was then that he rolled forward out of the way and placed blood that was on his hand on the sword itself.

"This sword is also something I need to get used to." Leo said, as he swung it, a slash of blood aura had been made.

Seeing this, 16 had gathered his own Qi and was ready to block it, but with the momentum of Leo's hand, he was able to split the blood slash into five smaller pieces. His red sword glowed while doing so and the five smaller attacks had gone around 16's attack.

The qi slash continued forward, but Leo was able to block it with a swipe of his sword, meanwhile his own blood attack that had split into five pieces had rejoined, coming back together, and went right through Agent 16, splitting him in half.

"I hope you both have peace in your next life." Leo said.

After the task was done, Leo went to check up on Sera. He had also completed his end of the deal. From there, they moved quickly. There was no rest for either of them as they moved to take out the next large targets again and again, but there was no sign of Chris or Zero. What they needed was a lead... and they soon got it.

# Chapter 1849: Leo and Sera. (Part 2)

After taking down the first two major bases, Sera and Leo continued from there onward. Both of them were surprised that the other had succeeded and actually believed that perhaps the other would fail. As a contingency, the plan in their head was to move to the base where the other had just lost, or to help them out.

Yet, they had both been successful and had managed to finish the task quite quickly. Because of this, they decided to continue attacking other major locations. Since the third one was on the flight path of both of them, they had decided to attack it together, which had only sped up their pursuit.

The Shelters were expecting their defences to last weeks and for attacks to have weeks in between. But in truth, they were falling in a matter of days with little rest on both sides.

After that, the group managed to take back all five of the major cities containing resources that could be used against them. Some of the cities started to fight back once they had learnt what was happening.

Key people were able to inform that their families and more had been held, hostage originally. At the same time, a few vampires or those from Sera's group, were left behind in the shelters they had taken over.

A small little token army to update them on everything that was happening, and just in case Pure decided to attack back. But in truth, everything was just moving too fast for Pure. The situation had turned on its head. Those that were their allies and support, had now become their enemy.

Finally, Pure had no choice but to back away. They had exited from the other shelters they had occupied, pulling out. It was a smart move on their end because there was still a major issue, which was the main Pure base.

Although, none of the Shelters were under the Pure banner anymore. With a sizable and strong force still out there somewhere, including the leader, it meant that they would be able to come back at any time, causing trouble again.

So, now together, both Sera and Leo travelled, trying to find members of Pure and track down the main base. Currently, the two were at a sand kingdom. A shelter that was covered in sand but had main base. Currently, the two were at a sand kingdom, places almost everything built from sandstone and golden jewels.

The kingdom was a wealthy one. There were rumours that they were working with Pure, helping them export certain goods, in return for crystals. The desert was bare and they had no well known travellers that could travel to other planets and get high-level crystals for them. Yet, the sand kingdom was known as a place with plenty of crystals. It didn't quite add up.

Currently, both Sera and Leo were confronting what was known as the Prince of the Shelter.

"I promise I know nothing, we have never done dealings with Pure!" The large man who was begging on his knees and had his fat belly showing said.

They were in the royal palace which was quite extravagant and there was even a throne towards the back.

All of this was just an act of the Shelter, since royalty had long stopped existing in today's society.

Sera then threw another frail man down onto the ground, he looked back and his eyes met with Leo's.

"Tell us everything about your kingdom and their dealings with Pure." Leo asked. It was his influence skill, and a human like so, it had worked out quite well on.

"The Rashin kingdom has a few deals set up. We purchase Glathrium using the crystals they supply us. We then take a small cut from those crystals and pass the Glathrium onto Pure." The man spoke.

The sweat could be seen running down the large man's face as he heard this. But that wasn't the end.

"We also, every month, send a ship full of slaves to them."

Hearing this, Leo's hand gripped tight around his sword.

"First, you lie to us. I can understand you might want to improve your kingdom so you have done deals with Pure. However, what I can't understand is why you would have slaves."

"Please!" The man begged.

"You don't understand, I didn't have the choice. When they came here, they realized that we already had our own slaves, but they said that if we gave the slaves to them, that they could live a better life."

"They paid a good price for them, and I can help you as well. That's what you want, right, crystals, money, I can cut you in on the deal as..." Before he could finish his sentence, Sera had thrown a small dagger that went right between his eyebrows and into his head, killing him on the spot.

"I could have gathered more information from him or we could have used him?" Leo replied.

"Really? I thought with your powers, you would have just told me that the Pure member is hiding right behind that throne." Sera replied as he took another dagger out and threw it right at the throne.

Instead of going through it, it spun and went around the throne and a loud scream was heard from behind.

Leo had seen the man with his ability, but thought there was a better way to find out what was going on, although Sera was right. It was unlikely that they knew the truth behind the slaves.

"Are they experimenting again to make those humanoid beasts, or is it something else?" Leo thought.

Quickly running behind, they could see that a man had been hurt, the blade had gone right through his leg. He took out a dagger and attempted to attack Leo, but in that moment, Leo pushed his sword down and the tip hit the side of the dagger pinning it to the floor.

"We need to try something else." Leo said.

"What do you mean? Can't you just use your red eye magical power?" Sera asked as he kicked the Pure member in the face causing his head to be flung back and hit the back of the throne. He was knocked out immediately and fell back to the floor.

"We have found Pure members time and time again, yet we still haven't found their base. The threat of Pure is not over until we find Zero."

"We can't keep doing the same thing hoping that one of these people have the information, which is why I would suggest something else."

When telling Sera his plan, his eyes lit up and he had quite a smirk on his face.

"Do you think they would accept?" Sera replied. "And besides, could you really do that to a person?"

"This man is the one that has been transporting the slaves. I have been tailing him in the Shelter for a while. His life is not one worth having. In the end, if he was going to die anyway, then he should at least have a use." Leo answered.

Sera had been with Leo for a while now, fighting side by side. As time went on, it was as if Leo was getting a little darker in his methods. For Sera, he didn't mind, but it did make him wonder why he was so concerned about finding this person.

It was then that Leo cut his hand and allowed for blood to fall. It dropped into the Pure agent's mouth. At the same time, he drew a circle underneath his body, one that he had been taught. The blood ritual was activated.

The Pure agent's eyes opened, and his eyes started to beam with a red glow. The next second, he had sprung awake. The Pure agent had become a vampire.

"Now, I'm sure you know a way to get back to your base. And I would like you to deliver a message to your leaders."

"Now that you're a vampire, I don't believe that they would treat you the same way as before, and I'm afraid you have no choice." Leo's eyes glowed red as he made the order.

—— —— ——

A week later, the Pure agent had returned to the submarine, the main base of Pure, with a note in his hand, but he was shaking. They had let him in after reading the contents of the message to them.

They knew it was important as he shook when he walked through everywhere until, he had finally met Zero. He opened up the letter and began to read it out loud.

"The men known as Leo and Sera, challenge both Zero and Chris to a duel at these coordinates. If you wish to accept, they will be there in two days' time at noon." The man had given his message and closed the letter.

Standing up, Zero walked over to him, placing his hand on his cheek.

"I can't believe he did this to you, don't worry. I'll help you."

Pulling out his blade, Zero took a slash swiping his head clean off.

"So you're that confident, huh, well, I accept."
