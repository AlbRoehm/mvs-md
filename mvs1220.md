# Chapter 1220 Vincent“s truth
Listening to the story, Vincent could only imagine the horror those on the Cursed ship had been through. At first, they were forced to go against their fellow humans, the strongest ability users that were known to exist. After feeling like they had pulled through, the Dalki had arrived.

Although, judging from the story, the Dalki had allowed them a bit of rest, but only for a moment. Then when they had finally crashed as their only option. They thought that they could head to safety at the Shelter, that everything was over, only to enter a den full of Dalki.

"It was my fault." Sam continued to say. "I was the one that led them to this Shelter, not thinking about it properly. Perhaps we could have tried to find a better place on the ship to huddle up. The strong Cursed members could have helped those fighting against the Dalki. Instead, we just jumped out of the frying pan and into the fire."

Sam had continued on his story from where he had left off before. After rallying those in the Cursed faction, they headed for the Shelter with a few Dalki hot on their tails. Luckily there were still a few strong fighters left that were able to help and fight them off, Dennis and Fex being two of them.

Eventually, after reaching the Shelter, it was only later that Sam realised his error. The Dalki in the Shelter had turned their attention towards the Cursed group that had arrived. They had grouped up, attacking them immediately. What was worse was the longer they spent fighting, the more Dalki would appear from the Shelter.

Realising his mistake, Sam was panicking and now was overthinking what decisions to make.

It was then that those in the Cursed faction had stepped up. The other leaders sacrificed themselves and had chosen to lead them off while fighting the Dalki.

The good news was that the Shelter was a large one. There were many different buildings they could use for cover. It was a Shelter that had been built for around thirty or so thousand people in the first place. The Dalki and the Cursed faction weren't large in number, so it was like a large game of hide and seek for the two. The Shelter could act like a small town, hiding between houses and more.

Which was exactly what Sam and the others with him were doing now. The split up had happened so fast, Sam had no clue where the others were. The only thing he could rely on was his nose, but he had two that were unable to move Nate and Layla with him.

He wanted to go out and search for the others to see if they were okay using his nose, Knowing the worse ones would be bleeding.

'With the two of them, it's hard for me to even move and help anyone. I don't really know what happened, but they haven't been able to recover.' Sam looked at Layla and Nate on the ground. The good thing was Sam had vampire strength, allowing him to lift the two of them.

"I told you to leave us. We will manage." Nate croaked, looking up. His eyes squinted as pain ran through his body. Even just moving his head was painful.

"Sam, do you really think it's your fault?" Vincent asked. "Do you know how many situations you have been put in and had to have made the right call? We can only look so far ahead, and we can't see into the future. Who knows if you stayed on the ship, what would happen? Maybe a Dalki would have spotted you and sent all those in the Shelter onto the ship. You could have been trapped with nowhere to run.

"You are a key player in the Cursed faction, and you always have been. Without you, Quinn would have made far more disastrous mistakes."

'Did he just refer to himself in the third person?' Sam thought but chose to ignore it anyway.

"Bonny, Void. I assume the live stream is still going on. Are you using those drones to see what's going on at the moment?" Vincent asked.

The two were dazed as they didn't expect Quinn to start asking them questions like so all of a sudden.

"Ermm, yes. The drones were safe from the impact. We are using them to find any of those who are too afraid to fight, but we haven't been able to go out and help them. However, there is one drone that isn't in the Shelter at the moment." Void answered.

"One drone, what is it looking at the moment?" Vincent asked.

"The fight between the five spiked Dalki and Hilston. Their fight has pushed beyond the Shelter, and they are still going at it even now." Bonny answered.

For a fight to last this long, it meant only one thing, that the two titans that were fighting against each other were evenly matched. Still, when two strong foes fought against each other, it also meant that one wrong move and either one of them could end each other.

"For now, I think we should search for the strong ones in the Cursed faction. Sil, Borden, Fex, Dennis, Megan and Peter. We need to gather them all and regroup. A winner will eventually come out from the big two, and we have to use this opportunity to strike them while they are weak. Either way, today we will be getting rid of them both." Vincent said as he walked towards the door.

"I'm sick and tired of him having to worry about a human of all things. It's not right." Vincent mumbled.

"Don't worry about the Dalki in this Shelter." He continued. "I'll get rid of them all." Before Vincent left, he stopped and looked at Bony for a few seconds. He started her straight in the eye as her face flushed red.

'I guess while I'm in his body, I should try to help him deal with the problems that he can't face. I'm just helping him out.'

"I would give up on the boy. He already has two on his mind that are too much for him to deal with. Maybe when he is older, and he doesn't have other problems, you can give it a go." After saying these words, no one saw 'Quinn' again.

"Was it just me, or was Quinn acting kind of weird?" Nate asked, hearing the whole thing.

But it wasn't just him. Everyone in the room felt like that wasn't the Quinn they knew. The way he talked, the fluctuations in his voice, and most of all, there was a strong air of confidence around him.

'That…that wasn't Quinn.' Was Layla's thought as her body was slowly recovering from using up all of her Qi. 'Who was that then, and where is Quinn?'

———

Inside the Shelter. The Blade kids had managed to stay together. When they arrived, they had been attacked by a few Dalki. They tried their best to use their abilities against it, but fighting against the Dalki and humans were different. Their fast movements and extremely resilient and strength made it nearly impossible for them to use their hand to hand combat skills they had practised with.

However, they were fortunate due to Grim Graylash, an old man and the ex-leader of the Graylash faction, present with them. Regardless of this, the kids were still troubled because he was currently injured.

They too were hiding. They had found themselves inside a storage room of some sort. Most of the containers were empty or destroyed as if the Dalki had already been through the room before. Grim was holding his side close out his ribs where blood continued to flow. In the crash, one of the Chained took advantage of the situation and attacked the ex-family leader, causing a serious wound to his body.

'These kids are strong, but they will struggle against the Dalki out there. I need to find those that can protect them. I don't know how much longer I will last.' The old man thought it was at that moment. Three Dalki could be seen entering the large storage room. Or more correctly, they were heard.

The old man, along with the Blade kids, were hiding behind one of the storage containers. They held their breaths as the heavy footsteps continued.

"You know if you wanted to hide, then you shouldn't leave behind a trail of blood!" One of the Dalki shouted, noticing it outside of the place. He punched one of the strange continues in front of him, sending it flying to the side and crashing into the wall.

Yet, no one could be seen underneath.

'Blood, but I made sure to stop my wound with my ability?' It was then that Grim noticed he wasn't the only one that was hurt. One of the Blade kids had been injured as well. Blood was trickling down and could be seen under his trousers.

It was Adeel. He had been hurt in the crash as well but hadn't told any of the others, so they wouldn't worry about him. He didn't want them to stay in one place because of his injury, but moving made the wound worse.

It was then that the Dalki had spotted more trickles of blood leading towards another container. Seeing this, the Dalki smiled and called the other two.

"My my my, I thought trusting my nose would lead me to something interesting." A voice said in the back.

'Huh, another human, but who could that be, and why would the person reveal themselves? Who could possibly take on three Dalki at once?' The old man wondered.

# Chapter 1221 An Awakening
A loud bang went off in the Shelter, and soon after, a building started to collapse, crumbling into pieces falling to the ground. It sounded like a bulldozer had gone full swing, hitting a building, but the sound didn't stop there as the bang was heard again, as another building was hit.

The cause of the noise was due to a mud-like humanoid beast being pushed back, crashing into the buildings. Right now, the beast had created a large shield, and a jet stream of water was pushing against it, not showing any signs of weakening. On initial impact, the strength had sent him through the buildings. Having reached the third building, he had found his footing. His back was up against the wall for support.

'Damn it! This Shelter is horrible for the beast's body to fight in. She has all this open space to use her powers and get away without me getting close!' Raten was complaining. Worst of all, even his mud shield didn't seem to be working out against Vicky's water powers. The strength of a Demi-god tier beast was losing.

Seeing that Raten was in trouble, Vorden soon made his move. He jumped between buildings, using his strong legs to propel himself like a spring, and heading straight for Vicky, who was standing in the middle of the street. Also, in the palm of his hand, a strong orb-like ball of wind was rotating, blue in colour.

The beast had wind powers, and through practice and speaking with Tails, who was inside of his mind, he found out that the wind attacks could actually be contained and controlled. Condensing them several times and holding them all in a ball. Esseintly, it had the power of a tornado but with edges as sharp as a knife.

"I have no choice!" Vorden shouted, throwing out the wind ball towards Vicky, but before it reached her. Pai quickly jumped in the way, and his body could be seen hardening on the spot turning grey like a metal colour.

When the attack hit, the wind strikes enlarged and soon lifted Pai in the air. He was in a round Vortex, with the attacks constantly hitting him, but only faint scratches were made on his body.

"What are you two doing!" Vorden cried out as he could see Raten's Shield turning into a slime mud substance. "There is no reason for us to fight! Shouldn't we be getting rid of the Dalki, or you should be helping Hilston!?"

Vorden never wanted to fight his fellow siblings, who he had grown up with in the castle. He felt like there was even less reason for them to fight now. They had all caught a glimpse of the fight before they had arrived at the Shelter. Perhaps they didn't want to believe it, but they could see. It seemed like Hilston was losing.

As if Vicky could read his mind, she shouted.

"As long as that man is alive, you know we have to do this! Hilston is a man that can never lose, never be beaten!"

Vorden wanted to say more, but being in the same position as herself, he could tell that Pai and her, the fact they were still acting out meant they were too far gone. Almost brainwashed in this belief.

'The jet stream won't stop, and I can't put my shield down, but any longer, and it will melt. It doesn't look like Vorden can do anything against Pai either, not that I expected any help from that weakling in the first place.'

'Let me swap.' A voice said inside of Raten's head.

At first, he thought he was going crazy. Soon he realized that there really was someone else that occupied the same mind as him. Unlike Vorden, Raten hardly communicated with him.

'Yeah right, you couldn't even beat me in a fight. What makes you think you could beat her?' Raten argued back.

'You might be good at fighting hand to hand, but I am better at using my powers. If you die, we both die!' The beast angrily said as it forced Raten out of its body, and the control was now coming from the beast.

The hard mud-like substance that would usually cover the rest of its body started to move and mix in with the mud Shield. Soon it created a large wall combining the two substances. The water continued to hit the wall making its consistency change by the second, but soon the whole wall had collapsed.

Before she knew it, Vicky could see a strange thing heading towards her on the ground. She attempted to use her lightning powers, Zapping it on the floor. Still, the mud creature showed no signs of slowing down, even when being hit.

When the mud creature was close, it formed a spike from itself, heading directly for Vicky. A clanging sound was heard. The one that had stopped the attack was Pai. At the same time, from behind, Pai was holding onto Vicky's hands. The two of them had finally achieved what they had been aiming for.

"Raten, we failed. We have to get out of here!" Vorden shouted, not knowing that the beast was in control. Using his wind abilities, he was quick, but the strange power gathering inside the twins was a stream of water so powerful they would be dead in an instant being hit by that.

It was their signature move when working together. Water powers were also what they had attempted to use to catch them on the island before.

'With both of their abilities combined together. They will be able to destroy anything that touches that water, and it will be too large and quick for us to even run from, so what the hell do we do?' Vorden thought.

Thinking about this and knowing there was no longer enough time to escape. He turned around, trying to plead his case once more.

"Do you really want to kill us? Why does Hilston even want Sil so badly in the first place? Have the two of you ever thought of that? He is so obsessed with getting Sil back he even left his precious island. Do you think any of us ever meant anything to him? Why are you doing this!" The words didn't seem like they were getting through, and even Vorden was just repeating the same things over and over.

"Live your own life, like we have!" Vorden shouted once more.

Raten now back in control. Could see Vorden stupid mistake and quickly ran back.

"I'm sorry, muddy, but if anyone deserves to live, it's this damn softy!" Raten said as he ran towards Vorden, ready to pull him down. Grabbing his shoulder, he pulled him back, risking his own life, that was until. Someone else grabbed both of their shoulders and threw them behind with a strong force that they landed on the ground.

"Borden?" Vorden called out, noticing the familiar facial features but with the Dalki-like features.

"Yep," Borden said with a thumbs up.

Seeing how confident Borden was, Vorden felt like he didn't understand the danger in front of him. The fact that once they joined hands, they were able to use the power of six ability users at once!

"No, even if you take that attack, you'll die! I know your body is strong, but you don't understand their power!" Vorden shouted out desperately.

"Hey, relax before you get a bad throat. I'm not dying today, and I'm not the one dealing with it. There was another person I ran to on the way here." Borden replied.

Before they knew it, another person was seen falling from above. Their blonde hair floated in the air, and a serious look was on their face.

"Sil?" Vicky called out, noticing the main person they had been looking for this whole time, but Sil showed no regard for who they were.

Instead, he ignored them and, when landing, placed both of his hands on the ground. In an instant, a giant pillar was created beneath them. It had appeared so fast it chucked the two up in the air.

It looked like Sil had used a giant hammer when he had landed to knock the ground beneath them up, but it was just his strong earth abilities that he was using at the moment.

Sil soon started to run, and beneath him, he created a staircase made of earth. Keeping up with his super speed. The whole thing looked impossible to anyone who even had these abilities. Just having such abilities and being able to use them like so were two different things. Reaching the two of them in the air, Sil grabbed both of their arms before they could do anything and, using his strength, pulled them, breaking their hands from each other.

"You guys always make the same mistake, taking the strongest elemental abilities. I learnt something when I lost to Hilston, but the abilities we choose are essential. I can't move as fast as him, my strength isn't as strong as his, so I'll just get an ability that can match him!" Sil shouted, his hands started to glow blue, and the next second, lightning continually struck their body.

The pain was so great it didn't take long for them both to pass out. The ground beneath Sil had now disappeared, and they were falling down out of the sky and quickly to the floor. When they landed, a large bang was heard as he hit the floor, and Sil's legs could be seen covered in a special coating, helping him receive no injuries whatsoever.

Both Raten and Vorden stood there watching Sil, holding both Pai and Vicky in his hands. They weren't moving at all. For a second, he hadn't let them go and dragged them across the floor. When seeing that the others were okay, he finally let them go allowing them to drop to the floor.

The two that they had so much trouble dealing with had been dealt with, so quickly and it was so overwhelming.

"He's gotten so much stronger, right?" Borden said with a smile. "I couldn't believe it as well until I saw him fighting against the Dalki. It's like he has had some kind of awakening."

Although the other two didn't say it, both Vorden and Raten were thinking the same thing. Right now, the look on Sil's face as he walked towards them, the way he used his abilities and had no care for the safety of the others, reminded them of Hilston.

"I'm going to beat that old man. I won't let that Dalki get him first!" Sil declared.

# Chapter 1222 The end of the Blade family

Sil, Borden, Raten and Vorden had all decided to move out from the original area where they had fought. Heading inside to one of the large buildings that seemed to act as a type of hotel. Although they didn't really use it to hide and instead were just waiting in the entranceway.

The suggestion had been raised by Vorden because there was something serious the group needed to decide, and he wasn't quite sure that Sil was in the right mind to choose. On the floor, behind the desk, Borden was keeping an eye on them. Both Pai and Vicky passed out on the floor.

"We need to decide what to do with them?" Vorden asked.

"What do you mean?" Raten replied. "If they wake up, you don't think they're going to try and fight us again. I think it's obvious what we need to do."

Even without asking, Vorden knew what Raten's suggestion was going to be, so instead, he was looking towards Sil for support. Still, he seemed to have something else on his mind, and Borden, although he had some connection to all of them, didn't really to Pai and Vicky.

"Do you really think they would continue to fight us even if Hilston is taken out of the picture? I can tell that they are just following his orders, and it isn't something they want to do." Vorden argued.

"Even if that was the case, you said it yourself, if Hilston is taken out of the picture," Raten replied.

The one thing Vorden wanted more than anything was time because Vorden had a feeling that after today, the Blade family would be different altogether, but soon Pai and Vicky would wake up again. They couldn't just keep fighting against them and knocking them out.

"I don't care what you do with them, Vorden. You can do what you want, but I need to go and get Hilston. Borden met up with mother, I met with father, which means the one that had met up with him was Peter, and I haven't been able to find him." Sil finally spoke, and it looked like he was ready to leave.

"Wait!" A female voice shouted, but in an instant, Borden had his hand around her throat, gripping tightly.

"I have strength beyond what you could imagine. If you try anything, then I will squeeze, and it will be the end of your life." Borden warned, and he even applied a little bit of pressure to show he wasn't joking.

The one who had called out was Vicky. She had regained consciousness a while ago and was listening in to the others to hear what they were planning to do. She wasn't stupid. The loss that she suffered before was because of Sil, and he could easily beat them again. Which was why she was waiting for him to leave.

However, she had heard something, and she wanted to confirm it herself.

'Why…is that a Dalki body? And this person, they look a bit like Sil? Who are they?' She thought.

One thing was sure, unlike the others that might have had some sort of troubled feelings for her, this one did not.

"I…I.just wanted to ask what happened to mother and father?" Vicky asked.

"They already left," Sil replied, continuing to look out of the entrance to see what was happening. "I left the ship a little later compared to the others. I thought the two of them might try to help Hilston in some way, and I would try to stop them, but then I saw that the two of them decided to take off into the desert, running off to who knows where."

Hearing this, Vicky's face was showing a hint of sadness and anger. Soon it started to change as she didn't really know what to feel.

"Vicky, you know they probably ran away to get away from all this mess, right?" Vorden said. "I mean, that island isn't normal. Look what happened to us. We are now in bodies that we don't even own, and all of this started because of him.

"Do you really think anyone would truly stay by Hilston's side if it wasn't for his power? I even saw some of the Chained doing the same thing. Rather than chasing after us or the Dalki, they ran into the desert."

There was no reply from Vicky, so Vorden didn't really know what was going through her mind at the moment, but one thing was clear, she no longer had the will to fight. Even Borden seeing this, had let go of her neck, and she just stayed in place doing nothing.

'Vicky has always been a hard one to get through to. Maybe the easy one to talk to would be Pai, whenever he wakes up.' Vorden thought.

"Sil, I don't think Peter is with Hilston at the moment," Vorden said. "If Peter was ever in any type of serious danger, or his life was nearly lost, then Quinn would be there to save him. On top of that, rather than going after Hilston, we need to make sure everyone else is okay. Where is even that kid that follows you all the time, the one that helped us, Shiro." Vorden said.

For the first time, Sil's eyes seemed to come to life as he turned his head, to look at the others. In his blinded thoughts of Hilston, he had forgotten entirely about Shiro.

"We have to- "

Interrupting his sentence was a loud bang that was in the centre of the Shelter. They all soon came rushing out of the hotel lobby to see what exactly was going on. Borden carried Pai over his back.

The explosions didn't just stop once though, they continued to go on and on. It was clear signs of fighting were going on in the centre, and it wasn't just between a single Dalki and those from the Cursed faction.

"Maybe the others are in trouble. We have to go!" Vorden shouted out, and they started running towards the sounds. Soon though, Vorden stopped to turn around as he could see Vicky standing there.

"Come on, you come as well," Vorden said, grabbing her by the hand and running along with everyone else.

——

The landscape of the centre of the Shelter had wholly changed. The buildings were no more as nearly all of them had been reduced to rubble from the fighting. Those who were currently there and still fighting, it was a group of ten Dalki.

Nine of them had two spikes, and one in the centre with the biggest grin on its face was a four spiked Dalki, named Patch. A nickname given to him due to the different coloured patches he had all over his body.

Usually, a Dalki would mostly be black in colour, but he had lighter shades on his body, making him look somewhat like a cow.

There were around three Dalki that had been killed on the floor around him, but Patch didn't seem to care, for he knew that the people responsible would soon meet their end.

"Guys, let's just get out of here. You two can't fight anymore!" Megan shouted as she looked at a badly beaten Dennis. One of his arms was broken. The socket of his left eye had been smashed as well, so he was unable to keep it open.

"She's right!" Shiro shouted. "You used up the blood in your flasks, and our powers can't help you guys. We have to go!"

"You don't understand. We can't leave this area!" Fex shouted back. He, too, was badly injured, but more so internally. Having taken one punch from Patch.

'That four spiked Dlaki, even after using the blood net, his punch still hit me and broke a few of my ribs.' Fex thought.

As for the reason why they couldn't leave the area, Dennis and Fex could smell it. Those in the cursed faction were hiding in the houses, through the streets in the areas not too far from them. If they left, the Dalki would soon spot them and kill them all.

"This cow like Dalki! He's a four spike. He has to be the strongest in the area. If we just get rid of him, we can rest!" Fex shouted, trying to give himself more energy.

"Hahah, me the strongest!" Patch started to laugh along with the others behind him. "If you truly believe that, then there was never hope for you all at the beginning. Right now, it looks like she has found someone she is enjoying her time with, and it's our job to make sure she isn't distracted."

"Are you talking about Dalki fighting against Hilston?" A voice said from behind. "Because we will get rid of them both."

When turning around, Fex had never been happier to see the crazy boy and the rest of them. Sil had arrived with the others by his side, and they were ready to cause a splash.

"I'm sorry, but I would like to request that I deal with this one." Another voice said. It sounded familiar yet unfamiliar to a lot of them there.

Breaking out of the Shadows, they could see his dark black hair and two gauntlets covering his arms.

"You will need to keep as many MC cells as you can for the big bad wolf. Otherwise, the pig's house will get blown down." Vincent said. "Wait a second, do they still tell that story at this time? I guess no one understands my references anymore.

"Just we're going to need you, so I'll take care of this one. I just need you guys to make sure that the other little minions don't get in the way."

"I'm already on it!" Another shouted from behind as his fist hit the Dalki straight in the stomach and sent it flying through the air. It was strength they hadn't seen before. Thinking about who it could possibly be, they could only imagine one person who was crazy enough to start fighting on their own before the others got involved.

"Screw you all!" Peter screamed. "I just need to get one punch in. Let me punch that old man just once!" Peter shouted in anger.

*****

# Chapter 1223 Worst Quinn ever
After punching the Dalki away, Peter didn't stop there. He quickly moved on to the next one y his side, showing off his incredible strength once more. However, rather than use his fists, he was using the pair of Tonfa weapons given to him. Logan's special design allowed them to shoot out from underneath his sleeves, holding them fairly in his hands.

In the fight with Hilston, one of them had been bent, but they were still great tools for Peter to use. Another Dalki that was close by threw a punch, thinking that its strength would be able to match against Peter's, but when it collided with Peter's weapons, it was in for a surprise as the knuckles of the Dalki started to shatter.

Being blunt weapons like so, it never thought it could receive damage so easily.

"All of you, get the hell off this planet!" Peter continued to scream. There was something about Peter's actions and words in this fight. Usually, the only emotion he showed was aggression, yet they felt more pure and raw for some reason today.

The reason being, was due to the planet they were on.

"You bastards nearly killed me, and now you're trying to hurt others again!" Peter shouted, hitting another. This time, a Dalki had gotten behind him and clawed at his back. His healing abilities were doing him massive favours as it was getting better, allowing him to fight just as he usually would.

Still, Peter would struggle to fight nine of them, but he didn't have to do it all alone.

"I understand Peter, I know why you're mad!" Vorden said, coming in fast and spinning into one of the Dalki's body, head first. Then having two of the small compressed wind balls in his hands, he threw them down towards the Dalki on the ground.

This planet, and the Dalki being here, was bringing back memories for them both. Because it was the planet where Peter had experienced near death, and it was from a Dalki.

"With them taking care of the others for me, I guess it's time I take out the boss," Vincent said, charging forward towards Patch, the four spiked Dalki.

Watching from the back was Megan, Shiro, Fex and Dennis. Having already been injured, they were now in the middle of recovering. They weren't just injured but also exhausted since they had originally led the Dalki away when the Cursed members entered the Shelter.

What Shiro and Megan were doing for the both of them now was producing small cuts on their hands, allowing the two to consume the blood, giving them time to heal. While doing so, they were paying close attention to 'Quinn' of all the fights that were going on.

After all, they knew how strong Patch was.

'That red glow on Quinn's hands, I've never seen like that before?' Fex started to wonder.

Right now, Vincent was using the blood aura, not as an attack, nor was he using the hardened blood. Instead, with the amount of blood control Quinn was capable of and Vincent's knowledge, he had covered both of his hands in a type of red aura.

When the Dalki came forward to attack, Vincent carefully hit them away, blocking them, and its hands were knocked to the side. The Dalki felt a slight pain as it touched the strange red aura. Vincent punched the dalki two times in the chest, causing blood to fall.

It looked down at the blood oozing from its body, and the Dalki just smiled and punched Vincent back. He had hit him away and right back to where the others were.

[50/100 Hp available]

Skidding across the ground, he managed to use the tips of the gauntlets and dig in, slowing down until he came to a stop.

'It did that much damage?' Vincent thought. He opened his mouth, and blood started to pour out.

"Blood bank activated!" Vincent shouted through the blood-filled mouth, and his wounds were starting to heal.

He still wasn't used to using the system quite yet through his mind, so he just called out commands instead that seemed to work as well.

'I thought that would be enough, but a four spiked Dalki is completely different compared to a two spike and one spike Dalki. Now I understand why Quinn turned into the Bloodsucker straight away.' Vincent thought as they went in for round two.

Charging in again, Vincent still had the red aura covering his hands. Despite the Dlaki's attacks coming in faster and stronger this time around, the red aura hands were still able to block the Dalki's attacks. Now, Vincent was more careful and was attacking the Dalki where possible.

"Why didn't Quinn use his shadow to block that last attack?" Fex wondered. "When was he this good at the vampire's hand to hand combat arts as well?"

Watching the fight, things weren't making sense.

Vincent getting frustrated, started to use more blood moves. In the middle of his actions, he spun under a swing from the Dalki and used a blood bullet from below, aiming at its head. He was hoping it would go through its skull.

The bullet left Vincent's fingers and went under the chin and through to the other side, but the Dalki was still moving. What was worse, the more Vincent was injuring it, the stronger it got, and Vincent wasn't sure he could keep up.

By now, all the other Dalki that were supporting Patch, had been defeated by the others. With Sil and the Blades, they defeated them easily.

"Don't worry guys, I can handle this!" Vincent shouted, still dodging the attacks. "Don't help me. I just need to study it a bit more."

It was a masterful display of skills but at the same time, worry for everyone else watching. They were wondering why Quinn wasn't fighting the way he usually was, but at the same time, it wasn't unknown to them for Quinn to try new things.

"Quinn, use your shadow scythe!" Dennis shouted.

"Or your blood hammer!" Peter said. "That's one of my favourite attacks of his."

"He could also use his Muay Baron skills?" Vorden said.

Eventually, realising that nothing Vincent was doing was working, he had tried to go for the thigh kick he had seen Quinn do many times before. It looked great, but something was off as the power in his hips just went there.

'Where's the snap in the legs? I'm sure I copied him perfectly.'

When it hit Patch, nothing had happened.

'Damn it, this is harder than I thought. I am not Quinn. I don't know how to use his Qi inside his body or use the shadow and fight at the same time, and these Dalki are difficult, to say the least. Doesn't he have any items I can use?' Vincent thought.

Before he knew it, he was lifted by his leg up in the air. Thinking about items, the unbreakable sword appeared in his hands using shadow equip. Vincent swung it widely at the Dalki. Due to his strength and sharpness of the sword, it was able to produce cuts but nothing else.

"Alright! I think I might need some help," Vincent asked

That one word was enough, as Sil, Peter and all the others were seen charging in. From then on, with all of their powers, it didn't take long for Patch to be on his last breath.

"Hah..look at you fools." Patch said, lying in his own blood. His body had been literally pulled and smashed apart, now he was on his last words. "Slicer…will kill you all."

With the Dalki dead, a lot of them now had questions about the strange actions of Quinn. Even now, he was acting differently. As he was using a type of cloth to clean the blood off his armour and equipment, something they had just never seen Quinn do before.

But before they could say anything. The people who were hiding, those who were shaking in terror, started to leave their buildings and from the streets and alleyways, all to cheer.

"They did it! Our leaders did it!" They shouted.

Soon more noise was coming from them, louder as more people joined in.

"Wait, why are they coming out now? What if there are more Dalki?" Megan said worriedly.

"Don't worry about that," Vincent replied, walking back to them. "I maybe couldn't take out the four spiked Dalki, but I was able to take out the rest in the Shelter."

Everyone was glancing at each other, waiting for the other one to ask the question.

"Who the hell are you?" Peter eventually asked. "Did you hit your head, or are you like these guys?" Peter asked, pointing towards Raten and Vorden.

Seeing this, reminded Shiro of something.

"Oh I know, you're the other consciousness, the one that was inside Quinn that time, aren't you?" Shiro asked.

Now the others were even more confused, and it was the first time they had heard of this. Some knew of Quinn having a system, not all, but no one knew about Vincent being inside the system, and now he was going to have to explain himself.

"Well I….I…" Vincent was lost for words, but a strange feeling was coming over him. "Arghhhh!" He screamed, quickly falling to the ground. The power in his legs could no longer hold him up.

"My energy, what is happening to me!" Vincent cried.

"Hey, is he okay? Is Quinn or whatever okay!" Shiro worriedly said.

"Is he faking this to get out of the questions?" Dennis wondered, but Fex and the others soon noticed the sweat running down his face.

"No, my energy is being taken out of me, and not at a low rate either. I don't think he was meant to take this much." Vincent replied.

"What are you talking about? We don't understand." Peter shouted.

"I'm talking about Quinn, of course!"

# Chapter 1224 The Clothed Dalki
One of the major issues with using the Demon tier amulet was that Quinn was unable to see through the eyes of those that were Marked, while also seeing through his own vision. He could switch who he had full control over and then see from that person's point of view, but not all of the Marked visions were shared.

This meant Quinn didn't know what Vincent was currently doing, and neither did Vincent. Still, they both knew where the other was and what they were attempting to do. Which was why Vincent never expected such a vast amount of energy to leave his body.

At first, it was gradual, but the fighting was over in the Shelter, so Vincent wasn't really worrying too much. He put on a brave face and ignored it, counting to act as he had been doing. However, soon the energy started to ramp up, so much so until his legs felt like jelly.

If it wasn't for the fact that the Dalki had already been dealt with, and the others were nearby to help, Vincent would have left at the first sign of his energy being drained. It would have been too risky to continue fighting if Quinn needed the power.

'Quinn, what is happening to you at the moment for you to have to use this much energy?' Vincent wondered.

In a way, using the Demon tier amulet and borrowing energy from himself. Quinn could get a Dalki to the point where it was nearly as strong as his own body. The Dalki already had its own standard strength. If Quinn wanted, he could transfer close to ninety percent of his energy, which he was doing now.

However, the Dalki wouldn't have Shadow powers, beast gear, or Qi. Only Quinn's skills and strength. With this thought, Vincent predicted that Quinn would only have to use this much energy if he was to go up against a four spike, as they had done.

———

A little while ago, Quinn with the two Dalki by his side, had spotted a lone Dlaki by the foot of a volcano, standing just beneath the mothership. It was a strange sight to see because even after waiting a while and observing its actions, he could see they just stood there in the same place.

'There are no Dalki ships as well. Did they clear them all? Or maybe they placed them closer up the Volcano closer to the mothership.' Quinn thought.

Seeing how things were, the quickest way to get to the Dalki ship was to head straight for the Volcano. Walking around would take a considerable amount of time, especially without his shadow travel.

'If the Dalki spots me and we get into a confrontation, I can use him to tell me where the other ships are.'

With no pods or ships, the Dalki had no way to return back to the mothership. Unless the mothership itself landed. He was sure that there had to be more, other than the few he had fought. Nethereless, Quinn soldiered on thinking there had to be a way.

'I can still do it. I don't need to overthink what is happening. The more time I waste, the higher chance I have of failing this quest. I just need to take down the Dalki mother ships.'

It was then that the strange clothed Dalki had spotted the three of them, and that was when it had made its first move. Quinn could see what happened as if it played in slow motion. It was a single leg. That was all it took for the clothed Dalki to cover the distance between the two of them.

It lifted one up as if he was going to go for a walk but suddenly jumped using the power of a single leg. It was in the air and soon directly in front of Quinn and the two others.

"You Dalki," Graham looked them up and down. "I don't recognise the two of you?"

After these words, things started to move too fast for Quinn to be able to react to the situation. One of the Dalki by his right side had been grabbed by the neck. Its power, useless in front of whoever this was.

'Two of us?' Quinn started to think as it was the first time he had heard these words. To humans, a lot of the Dalki features and Dalki looked similar to each other. It was only once in a while where they would come across one with something distinctive.

The fact that Quinn's plan had worked so well meant one of two things. The Dalki didn't really pay attention to those that they were working with, or they too struggled to identify between each other.

"Did you two put him up to this?" Graham asked, looking at the other two for answers. "I thought it was strange our ships were going down rather quickly. I thought it might have been a specific individual, but there was also another option. I just never thought I would see it. The day that a Dalki could be convinced to move over to the other side. Of course, it could be an ability of some sort, but that's what I'm here to find out."

A smile appeared on his face, and everything inside of Quinn was screaming danger. The Dalki's life in front of him was soon to die, so Quinn did what he thought would be best. To use the energy drain feature of the Dalki.

'I didn't get to test out the energy drain, so I'm not really sure this will work, but I can only try.' Quinn thought.

The Dalki that was being held soon started to feel weak. The strength in its limbs and eyes were disappearing from its body until eventually it had gone limp. Its life was gone. The good news was, as Quinn stood there, he could feel the surging energy of the Dalki inside of him.

He knew that energy could be taken and given to the one with the amulet. Still, he wondered if power from the other Marked could be passed onto other Marked, and it seemed his little test was successful.

He took note that the Dalki had died, just as the system had stated, there was no way to drain energy from one of the Marked without draining all of their energy. With this newfound strength, Quinn threw out a punch as hard as he could towards the strange Dalki.

'Let's see how strong it is first, and then I can decide if I need to get energy from my own body or from the other Dalki.' Quinn thought.

The fist that was thrown out was quickly grabbed by Graham. It was in the palm of his hand, and Graham hadn't even moved an inch from his spot.

"Oh, this is very interesting, that punch just now. Was it at the level of a top tier two spiked Dalki? Yet, you still only have a single spike on your back? Is this some type of mutation? I guess you are the important one in this little group. I have some questions for you."

Quinn tried his best to move his hand, but it didn't seem to be working. The strength was too much. Even when fighting the three spiked Dalki on board the ship, using this much energy was enough.

'I guess I'm just going to have to borrow a little from my own body.' Quinn did so while quickly switching his full control to the other Dalki.

The energy was being transferred into the first one. Changing full control, Quinn was directly behind the clothed Dalki, and had jumped up, performing a spinning kick towards the head.

The kick had landed, and even the impact was heard, but just like before, the body hadn't moved, and this was when Quinn could finally see it and could tell straight away why. Sticking out from the back of the clothing, he slowly counted each spike.

'1…2..3..4..5 a five spiked Dalki, here of all places!'

The Dalki that had just attacked and the one Quinn was in control of at the moment had its leg grabbed.

"Something is off. If you were really Dalki? Then surely you would have known that such weak attacks would have been useless against me." Graham said.

The next second, the leg on the other Dalki had been pulled from its body. It felt like there was no resistance at all. Similar to a human pulling off a leg off an ant.

It was then Quinn made the quick decision to drain the energy from the Dalki and give it to the one to itself as well.

'What is going on, a five spiked Dalki? What do I do?' Quinn struggled to think. There were a few options, but he didn't have the appropriate time to think them through. The Shelter behind him still had humans and those from the Cursed faction. If the mother ship wasn't destroyed, then they were unable to leave through the teleporters.

Quinn would be fine, but it would mean abandoning all the people and the Shelter. At the same time, if he used the energy from his body. Would it mean Vincent could no longer help the others?

Due to him not being able to think clearly, the only thing he thought at that moment was that he needed to use all the strength he could muster to take down the Dalki in front of him. He had the power of three single spiked Dalki running through his body at the moment, and was drawing the energy from himself. He didn't know how strong he could get, but he just had to defeat what was in front of him.

Now with all the strength in his body and having returned to the original Dalki who had its fist grabbed, Quinn performed a thigh kick. The strongest thigh kick that a Dlaki had ever produced in its life.

Just moving his feet from the ground, the rubble was dragged up with it, the wind felt like it was shifting with the entire kick, and it had landed perfectly on the clothed Dalki's leg. To others, it would have sounded like thunder.

The second it connected, the strength in the clothed Dalki's hands had loosened. Quinn used this opportunity to pull back, jumping away.

'I can do it. I can fight with this body!' Quinn thought.

Looking up again, Quinn this time, could see his head had been grabbed.

"You are interesting, very interesting. I'm going to be taking you back with me." Graham smiled, unhurt and unfazed by Quinn's power.

******


# Chapter 1225 Finding out secrets
The Dalki known as Graham had a firm grip on Quinn's current Dalki body, holding him at the top of his head. Quinn, having delivered one of his most powerful moves while also being in a strong body that relied on sturdiness and strength it looked like his attack had hardly affected him.

'With the last Dalki he was able to rip its limbs off with no trouble at all. He must have crazy grip strength. If I move my head, I'm done for!' Despite the thigh kick not working before. Quinn decided it was the only thing he could do.

Now, lifting his leg up again, Quinn went to kick the leg not once or twice but did so until his body would give up or tire out. As soon as his foot touched the ground, he lifted it up again, kicking his opponent's thigh. Loud thunderous bangs after bangs echoed throughout. The strength of the kicks was shaking even the volcano nearby.

"That move seems rather interesting. Maybe I should give it a go?" Graham said, still holding onto Quinn's head. He then lifted up and twisted his hips, trying to imitate the kick. It was a poor imitation of what Quinn had done, and it looked like nearly no effort had been put into it at all.

Yet, the second the foot touched him, he could feel his whole body falling to the ground. Before he knew it, Quinn could see the dark sky above. Quickly, he tried to get back up, knowing the longer he spent on the floor would mean doom to himself.

'Huh, why can't I get up?' Quinn wondered. It was only then that he realised that his left leg was bent in an unusual shape. His thigh almost looked like he had gained another joint. Underneath the hard Dalki skin, the area was heavily bruised and swollen.

'I….I…have to do something. If this guy gets to the Shelter, there will be no one who can stop him!' Quinn thought.

Using this time, he realised that the Dalki was simply playing with him. All of his actions, not once had it seemed like it was being serious in the fight. Also, the Dalki wasn't aggressive like the others. Instead, it was slowly making its way towards Quinn.

In a way, this just sunk in the fact that Quinn was outmatched in this situation.

"I have to get up, I have to, but I can't draw any more energy from myself." Looking at his hands, Quinn thought of the only thing he could do. With his sharp claws, he started to claw at his enormous chest. Digging in his fingernails around an inch deep.

While in full control, Quinn could feel everything the Marked could, but he bore through it because he could tell it was working. The green blood flowing was making his body rise with new energy.

After scratching at his chest multiple times, he soon continued to do so on his forearms, drawing more and more blood, and that's when Quinn started to notice something as well. The green blood leaving his body wasn't only giving him energy, but the swelling on his leg had gone down. He wasn't sure if he was imagining it, but his legs were also starting to heal themselves.

'What is happening? I thought by hurting myself, I could muster up more energy, but losing blood is giving me the same effect as if I was to drink blood like a vampire?' Quinn started to think.

It was a strange feeling, to say the least. Although his energy and strength were seemingly at an all-time high, he could feel his heart weakening as if he was about to die. Bordering on the line between life and death.

And that was when the last change had occurred in Quinn's Dalki body. He could feel something growing from his back. Out from the middle of his back, a second spike popped out.

"An evolution at a time like this. Well, I can't say that I'm surprised, but if after all this time, you only were able to get to a two spike right now, it must have meant you haven't been doing a lot of fighting. Which is why I'm even more interested in you!" Graham said, charging forward.

Rolling like a log, Quinn moved away from a stomp coming from Graham. The hard ground broke apart, and red hot lava spewed from where he stepped. Soon Quinn pushed off the ground with his hands and looked ahead, trying to see where his enemy was.

'Now I'm a two spiked Dalki. My powers have increased even more!' Quinn thought. 'It has to be a sign that someone wants me to kill this damn Dalki!'

"Don't get too excited." A voice from behind Quinn's ear said, and the next second, Quinn's head was slammed into the ground. It wasn't just bashed into once. Graham continued to hit his head into the ground again and again repeatedly, and whatever Quinn tried, it wouldn't work. Before Quinn could even move, he was injured.

'This is the strength of a five spike?' Quinn was only left with these thoughts. 'Even with all this extra strength I have been given, I was still unable to do anything against it. I can't imagine anyone beating it. I haven't suffered a loss like this since….Arthur.

'I wonder…I wonder how I would have done if I was in my own body.'

It was then that Quinn decided that he had no choice. He couldn't take the pain anymore. He had given up on trying to defeat the Dalki and found himself back inside his own body.

"Hey Quinn, are you okay?" A young voice said.

Looking up, Quinn could see the other members of the Cursed faction around him. He was in a pile of rubble, and the one who had spoken was Shiro.

'It looks like everyone is safe here, Vincent. Do you think you could quickly update me on what happened here?' Quinn asked, looking for an update on the details.

Giving him a quick skim of events, Quinn was happy to know that everyone was okay and that the Shelter was safe. His body was weak, and he wondered how long it would take him to recover, but that's when he realised something.

'Wait, the Demon tier amulet, I can still feel the Dalki's energy. Has the Dalkinot killed him? He did seem different compared to the others, and if it was a five spike, he had to have been one of their leaders. Maybe I can get some more information from them?

'Vincent, It looks like you did a good job, I'm sorry to say, but I'm going to have to leave you with them for a little while longer.'

Of course, Vincent had no problem with such a thing, and Quinn soon found himself returning to Dalki's body.

———

Arriving back in the Dalki, Quinn found himself in an immense amount of pain. He looked to be on one of the strange Dalki ships, heading towards the mother ship, and the one piloting it was none other than the one Quinn had fought not too long ago.

'He smashed all of my bones, but it looks like he also knew the right amount just to keep me alive. I'm sure he has a lot of questions for me, and it looks like they knew just the right amount to keep this body alive as well.' Quinn thought.

Keeping his mouth shut the whole way, Quinn's condition didn't seem to get better or worse. Finally, being carried by the Dalki with one hand, he found himself on the ship. Soon he had been taken to a room he had never seen before but was placed in something familiar.

Now, the Quinn's Dalki body was floating in a green liquid in a giant glass tube. His bones still didn't seem to be healing, but Quinn could feel his mind waking up again.

"This chamber will keep you alive, and if I want to, I can make it so this liquid speeds up the recovery of your body, healing it. Interesting right? The other Dalki don't know about it yet, but I've been developing the solution myself. A way to make the Dalki heal even quicker and eventually evolve on their own. Repeating the process will allow us to force an evolution on those that didn't quite manage to evolve on their own. You are a fortunate person to be in here, although I won't be healing your body until I find out just why you are so special." Graham said as he went off not too far away and started to work away at a strange-looking computer.

Quinn looked around the room to see if he could gather any information. Just being here now, he had already learnt that this strange contraption he was in was something they never knew about before. He wondered if it was because of such machines they had seen an increase in spikes on Dalki lately or if it hadn't been introduced yet.

Both of them were worrying thoughts. Staring off far, Quinn could see that Graham kept on glancing at something. That's when Quinn noticed what it was. It was a live stream. The stream coming from Bonny and void.

At the moment, what was being displayed was the fight between another five spike with a long tail, and Hilston.

'Hilston….will he win?' Quinn wondered as he started to think who was stronger, having fought him and a five spike recently.

******

# Chapter 1226 Broadcasted to everyone
Bonny and Void's live stream was considered popular around the world. However, In recent times their popularity only grew more. As fewer and fewer people were able or willing to broadcast during tough times.

Focusing on current events and asking questions the people wanted to hear, going to places to find the information people wanted to hear. These were all elements that made them popular. The bulk of viewers would be the non-fighters and those not on the front lines. What they didn't expect was that right now, more people than ever were watching their broadcast.

It wasn't just those civilians at home who were watching what was going on. The fight between Hilston Blade and the five spiked Dalki had more viewers than ever. They were people who had never heard of the Blade family before, yet now were able to witness their great power. On top of that, Bonny accurately gave the viewers everything they knew about the Blade family. The source of her information was none other than Logan.

One of the people that hadn't left the Ship despite everything that was going on, was Logan. He could tell if anyone was to come his way. On top of that, he had the power to still control the Ship and control it in ways that would make it difficult for them to reach his position. As he expected anyway, not a single person had decided to stay on the Ship or come after him.

During this time, Logan kept an eye on the stream, and he also found it amazing how many people were currently watching.

'It's not just those on Earth? It looks like it's those on the Shelters as well that are watching what's happening. How are they able to deal with the Dalki attack going on?' Logan thought.

Despite this, he had decided to inform the public about Hilston Blade and the Chained. Hilston was too big of a threat to leave untouched like they had done so far. If after this, he was able to roam around free again without people knowing how much of a dangerous person he was, it would be bad not just for the Cursed faction but the whole of humanity.

All of the information he was giving was putting the Blade family in a bad light by Bonny, however despite all of this. People couldn't keep their eyes off him as they saw his sheer power being used against the five spikes.

What Logan didn't know was that he was somewhat right about the Dalki currently not fighting against the others on the planet at the moment. This was because they were now watching the live stream and looking at the fight between the two.

In the temporary base they had built on each of the planets, they were watching one of their great leaders fight it out. What the Dalki were building on each of the planets was what the humans had come to refer to as a Dalki fortress.

These were small camps, where they would have strange walls made from the black material, in a similar shape to a wall made of logs. They would then have several towers on the outside larger than the wall. Although they were made very quickly, they were just as sturdy as the Shelters the humans made.

This was mainly due to the black material that was used that seemed to be as hard as Glathriuem but nowhere near as hard to obtain. At least that's what the humans thought.

In one of the fortresses, a dome-shaped arena had been built in the middle. The Dalki liked dark places, so they tended to make areas that would allow for little light to enter. They weren't affected by light in any way. Fighting wise or health wise, it just didn't feel natural to them.

Perhaps it had something to do with the planet that they were born on or something to do with the nature of the beast they were made from, but no one truly knew why. Here was where One horn was currently at.

He wasn't alone, as the other Dalki from the main mothership were inside as well. All of them were watching the projection that was being played on the wall. Large enough for them all to see.

They were cheering at the screen every time Slicer would get a good hit in or a cut. What would be surprising to any human to see this, was they were doing the same every time Hilston would land a big blow as well.

"I'm surprised the humans had someone that could push Slicer this far. How do you think you would have fared?" A Dalki asked who had one missing eye. Because of this, the others often referred to him as Clops, a three spiked Dalki that had recently obtained his fourth spike.

"Have you been listening to the video? From the sound of it, this is one of the strongest humans in the world. Someone that was left off the radar that even we don't know about. The strong point of Slicer is that tail of hers, but the armour he is wearing seems to be giving her trouble. If it was me, I would smash that armour with my fist." One Horn said, making a fist.

Some of the others started to laugh, but as soon as One Horn looked their way, they quickly shut up. It wasn't usual for the Dalki to be scared of others. Even if they did have more spikes, it just wasn't in their nature, but One Horn had a more aggressive nature compared to the others.

"Leave them be. They know Slicer's strength because she has displayed it to everyone numerous times. Although she was someone who had evolved into a five spike before you, you are both a five spike now." Clops said, trying to calm him down and cheer him up. "We don't know who would win a fight between the three of you. It's not like the past where you would all have a go at each other."

The words certainly did put a smile on One Horn's face because it was true. One Horn had caught up to the two that used to be above him in strength. In the past, the Dalki would constantly fight each other over the leadership seat, and this was how One Horn had grown to the top.

But even before that, he had been appointed representative of the Dalki to the humans by his fellow Dalki Graham, which was why he listened to him more so than the others. Graham could see that he had more strength than the others even before he knew it himself, but when One Horn had finally caught up with them, now having five spikes like the other two.

Graham had told him that he was not to fight against the other leaders. For their powers now were too strong. A fight between two five spikes could possibly destroy anything they were on.

———

The Supreme commander had received the reports from all the Shelters that the Dalki had stopped their advance and attacks. Some of the Shelters wanted to use this opportunity to try to strike back, but Sach ordered against it.

Going on the attack was not a good option straight after suffering such a large attack. They didn't have the forces, and they needed to use this time to recover. While doing so, everyone who was in the Shelter, including the fighters, were also watching the live stream. This was how nearly everyone in the world was tuned in to watching Hilston against the five spiked Dalki.

Apart from one group in particular.

'This. Fight, it seems to have great importance. We are seeing the strength of a five spike for the first time and seeing what one of our best against one of their best can do. While everyone is distracted, this is the perfect time for you. I hope you stay safe.' Sach thought.

——

The very person that Sach was thinking of had finally arrived at the destination he had been called to. Although they hadn't arrived at the Shelter. Instead, a small army group of around three hundred or so, with Nathan in command, had landed in the middle of the jungle.

'This is the place, the place where Oscar and Sach fought against One Horn.' Nathan thought as he looked off in the direction of the Shelter.

******

# Chapter 1227 Prisoners or V
The Earthborn group had attempted to find out what was happening on this particular planet before. They had discovered a group of Dalki not too far away from a group of humans. This was something unprecedented, so they had come to the conclusion that the only reasonable explanation had to be that these 'humans' had to actually have been V.

Alas, the first mission had turned out to be a disaster, mainly due to the presence of One Horn on that planet, who had bested Oscar, Sach and Samantha in a battle of strength. As if the subsequent loss of the Supreme Commander hadn't been enough, the military had also lost their only Demon tier weapon.

'I was in charge of the reports back then and learned from Sach everything that happened.' Nathan thought as he and his group were still deep in the jungle-like territory away from the Shelter. The map displayed different routes and the area they were currently in.

Because the military had once owned the Shelter they knew the area very well. It was perhaps what had also been Sach's downfall as he had been overconfident.

'Sach warned me not to repeat the same mistake that they had made. One Horn should not be there, but I need to remain cautious and act under the worst case assumption that there might be a Dalki just as strong there..'

Three men came out of the jungle in full beast gear. Underneath it was their military uniform. They gave a quick salute before handing in their report.

"Sir, we have finished scouting out the area as per your instructions. The Dalki are indeed still present. From what we could find out there has been little to no interaction between them and the humans in the Shelter so far."

"However, from what we could see it appears that the Dalki have spread out in a shape that allows them to act as sentries. Those on guard outside consist of eight single spiked Dalki, two, two spiked Dalki and finally a single three spiked Dalki who should be their leader."

Taking this information in, the Dalki forces here were smaller than all those that had been sent to the other planets. They outnumbered the Dalki greatly which was good news all apart from one fact.

'We should be able to handle one spiked and two spiked Dalki, especially if we can manage to divide and conquer them. But the three spike… we might need to isolate him first or last to stand much of a chance…'

Next it was Nathan's job to sort an attack force that could deal with the issue. Unfortunately, retreat wasn't really an option. The fact that the Dalki remained here and even went so far to protect this place, especially when they had launched an assault on other planets, meant that something on this planet was of great importance to them.

Unfortunately, given the circumstances, Nathan couldn't call for reinforcement.

This was a special task that had been given to him, the more people that knew about it, the higher the chance one of the V would find out, leak it and thereby cause all sorts of problems. On top of that, there weren't really any reinforcements to help in the first place.

'The best course of action would be to have no confrontation in the first place, maybe I'm missing something.' Nathan thought as he continued to look over the files. The others were getting anxious and riled up, thinking that they were about to go into full combat any second now, but Nathan was sure that patience was the right answer in this situation.

'The reports…what if we were wrong? I've spent a long time with Quinn and the others, so I know more about the V than anyone else here. Not only do their eyes turn red and they use the strange red aura for attacks, but their nose is so sensitive it can distinguish between humans and themselves. We aren't too far away from the Shelter, so shouldn't they have picked us up by now?'

'The reports also never specified any cases of V actually being spotted here… Are these humans that are with the Dalki really working with the V? Rather than working with, could it be that the people are actually their prisoners? In that case, could it be that they're less worried about someone coming in and more about those people escaping?'

Still, this theory raised the question of why Dalki, who had never been known to take prisoners, would go out of their way now? What's more the reports agreed that the inhabitants of the Shelter had fought back together with the Dalki.

'That could just be due to us attacking them aggressively. At the time, the people must have been afraid due to the existence of the V, so they properly didn't take the time to check them out.'

With this new idea in his head. Nathan ordered those three to watch if any of the humans ever left the Shelter, and if so to find out what they were doing. This way he could determine if they were collaborating or if they really were prisoners or not.

A while later Nathan had received another report from his scout group.

"We have been observing them for a while now. The Dalki attack any of the beasts that enter the area. Once in a while a group of humans go out of the Shelter to gather resources and water from a river not too far. During this time, a single Dalki will head out with them."

The group consisted of five people. It was a small number of people allowed to leave the Shelter. Clearly not enough for them to overpower the single Dalki. It was looking more and more like Nathan's new theory was right and that the people weren't the Dalki's allies but prisoners.

"Assemble two squads. I want the ten strongest men in terms of single attack strength abilities, and make sure that their abilities don't make much noise either. Their goal will be to kill the Dalki who accompany the people. After that make sure to capture the humans with them ALIVE! Get one of our intelligence agents on standby as well, some questions are going to have to be answered."

———

Soon enough ten men gathered in front of Nathan, and with the information of the route and scouting team, they were able to all move together well due to the information. This was the way one would use the advantage of numbers, without necessarily needing all of them to be top fighters.

When they had finally reached the river, they could see the group of people gathering large amounts of water. The Dalki stood next to them on watch. During this period, Nathan started to gather his ability in his hands, readying a bubble that was larger than any other.

"Okay, now!" Nathan ordered.

Immediately, coming out from the jungle forest, the group of ten all used their abilities against the single spiked Dalki. One squad aimed at his head while the other at his heart to ensure he would die in that one shot. Meanwhile, Nathan had run forward to encase all of the humans by the river in a giant bubble to ensure they wouldn't inform the other Dalki.

The humans were shocked and hesitated about whether to help the Dalki or not. Two of them recognised the military uniforms, so they tried to use their abilities on the military personnel. However, while in the bubble they realised that something was wrong.

"What is this? Why isn't my ability working?!" A man shouted in panic.

Nathan's ability may not necessarily be the strongest, but it was perfect for dealing with other ability users, who weren't too much stronger than him. Looking to his left, he could see that his people had already accomplished their task, the Dalki had died before injuring any of them.

When there was only one, a burst option of strong abilities was the best option, due to the Dalki's nature of getting stronger the more injured they were. Now that they were free, Nathan didn't have to worry so much about having to fight the humans.

"Now that the Dalki has been dealt with, I just have some questions I want to ask you. Please cooperate with us, so we can save everyone inside the Shelter." Nathan hoped that this approach wouldn't be met with resistance from them.

Nathan made a sign for the other ten who still had their weapons drawn and abilities active to lower them, so that a fight could be avoided. Although they were inside his bubble, the people could still use their beast gear, and if they were to step out use their abilities again. Of course he didn't reveal that to the four of them.

'Wait, why are there only four of them this time? Didn't the report say that the humans always traveled in groups of five?'

"Let them go, or I will be the one to take care of you all!" A female voice shouted from behind.

Turning around, a little down the river, Nathan could see a dark skinned woman with long braided hair, but what stood out about her the most was the weapon she had in her hand. It was glowing and pointing towards them. One felt cold just looking at the weapon.

'That's the…Demon tier weapon!' Nathan instantly recognised it. 'Why did the Dalki hand it over instead of keeping it for themselves? Were we unlucky… or was all of this a trap to lure us out?'

# Chapter 1228 The urge to kill
Quinn had decided to let his consciousness remain inside the Dalki body as this was a rare opportunity to learn more about the Dalki. Sure he had already been told about their origins, and he believed to know what their end goal was, but all of that had been told to him by others.

By now, they had already become their own species and judging by the scientific method the Dalki was using on him, it was clear that he was someone with great intellect.

Luckily for Quinn, apart from the fact that the six spiked Dalki had not outright killed him, was the fact that Graham was allowing him to watch the fight between Hilston and the five spiked Dalki. The Vampire Lord wasn't particularly cheering for one side or the other to win, in fact he would much rather see them defeat each other, but the important bit was that his Cursed faction had seemingly decided not to get involved.

"I see that you seem to be showing a great interest in the fight." Graham noted while still analyzing what looked like wave patterns on a certain screen. "Honestly, I was half expecting you to tell me everything I needed to know about you by now. Begging me to restore your body back to the way it was, but you did no such thing."

"Are you not afraid of death?" Graham turned around, looking Quinn right in the eyes.

Quinn honestly didn't know what the right move was at the moment. Should he try and pretend that he was the Dalki that he had taken over, perhaps admit to having sold out his race? However, the question was whether he could actually pull it off?

"The look in your eyes, it's… different. You're the one of the few who has the same look as me." Graham muttered more to himself than to Quinn, before turning around and going back to his computer glancing at the fight happening in the background once in a while.

"Perhaps I have found someone who can understand me more. You see, the intelligence of our race is not inferior to that of humans. We are capable of doing the same things as them and just like them some of us are different. Unfortunately, most of us don't make use of that gift. The majority gives in to that aggressive impulse our bodies produce when we come across humans. I suppose in that way we are no different from beasts."

"I wonder if our creator designed us with that flaw in mind or if it was just a coincidence. Many may think that I'm the only specimen who has managed to surpass this urge, but the truth is they are completely wrong. It's just that my urge goes far beyond just simply wanting to kill off any one human I see. After taking my first life, I knew straight away that my urge went beyond that of my brethren, yet I had no way of satisfying it for the longest time."

"Speaking about humans, I still have to make up my mind whether I should consider us more or less advanced than even them. Speaking from a physical point of view, the answer might be obvious. However, while humans grow to reach their final form, what about us? We can evolve, but doesn't that mean that we have yet to reach our full potential?"

"Each new spike opens up a new world, beyond our wildest imaginations, but does it ever stop? What might happen if we reach ten spikes, twenty or even a hundred? I consider it my duty to push my race to the top, so it will reach its peak, but of course there is one huge problem that might make it so I will never be able to personally witness the ultimate evolution of a Dalki… Our time limit."

Listening carefully, Quinn was starting to realise that this Dalki was pretty insane. Talking about satisfying his urge beyond just killing a human… Did he intend to outright eliminate the human race then? Or was it the evolution of his race that he seeked?

As for the last line, 'Our time limit' Quinn had a good guess what that was referring to. The short life span of the Dalki. He had long since wondered if this entire war couldn't be avoided. If the Dalki were forced to fight to find a way to escape death, couldn't they just hand over the Demon tier beast?

However, after listening to the clothed Dalki speak, Quinn now understood that it might be impossible for both races to coexist, because it was just in the Dalki's nature to want to kill them.

"This is why I can't understand why you would be working with the other side. A weak one spike… well I suppose now you're a two spike going up against us? Just what could they have promised you to make you switch sides? Why would they even want to accept you, given that you would have run into someone who could have taken you out sooner or later?" Graham asked, hoping for some reaction from his possessed brethren.

"Checking your brain waves I can tell that your mind isn't being controlled at the moment. You are able to register everything I'm saying even now, so why? How could they exploit us?"

"Humans have weaknesses, people they care about, those they would risk their lives for to protect. Even the 'V' as they had so poorly been coined, who believe to be able to disregard their own feelings, have things they care about. Even that vampire had something that was used against him to get him over to help us."

"On the other hand, we were created at the same time. So we are all of a similar age. We are related but at the same time not, unable to have any children of our own that could be used against us. The only thing we care about is ourselves and were it not for our need to work together to save our own lives, we would probably fight each other to further evolve ourselves."

There was silence in between. And Graham had turned around to look at Quinn once again, before turning away after getting no such answer.

"... a shame. I guess your sole purpose will be as just another one of my test subjects then." Graham sighed.

"Do you think she will lose?" Quinn finally spoke from inside the Dalki's body.

"Slicer? As a five spike who hasn't seen the limits of her evolution how could it be possible for her to lose against that human? No, not only will she not lose this fight, there might even be a chance she could evolve from it." Graham smiled as the strapped Dalki could only be referring to the fight on the screen.

That in itself was a scary thought, but Quinn could see a light. The one in front of him, the one fighting Hilston, and the one that had fought against Oscar. The Dalki weren't so much above them. These were the ones that they needed to beat.

"Are you willing to make a bet, if Slicer will be able to live?." Quinn asked

Graham knew that the Dalki in front of him couldn't run anywhere else, so out of curiosity he shifted his gaze to the screen. He was eager to discover whether the confidence of his subject had any ground to stand on.

———

Ruby continued to hold the Demon tier weapon in her hand. It was shaking slightly, something that Nathan didn't miss.

"You don't want to hurt us, do you? As you can see we haven't hurt any of your people, just the Dalki. I apologise for the way you might have been treated by my predecessors, but we're here to help you." Nathan put the palm of both of his hands up to calm her down. He knew the weapon was a ticking time bomb. If the active skills were used correctly all ten of them could perish in an instant.

Ruby looked at the dead Dalki on the floor. It was then that water started to fill her eyes.

"Why? … why did you come back? Just leave us alone… please. I-I don't want to… I don't want to cause any more trouble!"

It was apparent that Ruby was unstable, but Nathan couldn't just let them go before getting any information out of them. They were the key to finding out why the people in the Shelter were being kept as prisoners and why the Dalki would never give their prisoners something as vital as the Demon tier sword in the first place.

"Are you sure you want us to leave?" Nathan questioned here. "We've already killed that Dalki, so I'm sure you won't be able to just walk back like that. We also can't just let the others find out that we are here. You're humans just like us, surely you don't want to cooperate with the Dalki. Whatever they have on you, with that weapon and our help we can help you get out of here!"

Still not putting the sword down or letting go, it looked as if Ruby was considering his words.

"... no, he is already helping us! I can't let his troubles go to waste."

The Demon tier sword started to glow brighter, and a strange ice vortex was forming around it.

"Everyone, get out of the way!" Nathan shouted.

*******

# Chapter 1229 The Dalki or Military
NOTE: In the last chapter my Editor changed Graham from a five spike into a six spike Dalki, he is a five spike.

A vortex of ice was swirling around the Demon tier sword. The motion started slow at first, but soon started to pick up speed as more ice formed around the blade. Nathan knew what was about to happen soon if they did nothing. His heart was beating, afraid of their demise if the sword's active skill would be fired off at them.

One of the humans' great human treasures to be the end of him was not something he had expected.

'That damn active skill creates a large tunnel of ice and just the smallest touch will make us turn into ice sculptures!' Nathan started to panic as his ability could do absolutely nothing against that. The General quickly made a signal with his hands, a sign for his subordinates to enter the bubble he had created.

It didn't take long for a well trained group to overpower the group of normal civilians from the Shelter. In a matter of seconds they were disarmed, pinned to the ground, having faced next to no trouble at all. The soldiers then turned, while Nathan also moved himself, so they were to face Ruby and the charging Demon tier weapon.

'I didn't want to do this, but I have to gamble that she won't hurt her own people.' Using those people as human meat shields left a bitter taste in Nathan's mouth, but it was clear that Ruby wouldn't just listen to reason. Nor could they run away or fight such a thing. 'I just hope she hasn't already gone through the motions of activating the skill yet.'

Seeing what Nathan had done, Ruby of course didn't want to hurt those from her fellow Shelter. Unfortunately, great power was already flowing through the weapon and the woman felt like she was unable to move from her place. She attempted to lift the weapon away, but it was stuck in place as if her hands were frozen as well.

'This is the first time I've tried using this weapon. I should have tried testing it a few times!' Ruby panicked.

'I have to do something.' Nathan thought as he ran forward. He wasn't sure if this would work, but he had to try something, otherwise they were all doomed. Two bubbles formed over his hands.

"Help me, I don't want to kill them." Ruby cried out.

"It's a deal then! I just need you to answer my questions and help me out after this." Nathan quickly agreed, as he held onto the demon tier's bladed edge of the sword with his finger tips. He pushed with such strength that the palm of his hands had been cut open from the blade but only ever so slightly, before the blade propelled with force and left her hands. It could be seen falling into the river nearby.

At that moment, the active skill activated. For a moment it looked as if the whole river lit up, but seconds later the large body of water froze over. Some of the military personnel looked down the river to see how far it had frozen over, but it went even further than their eyesight could see.

Rather than apprehending Ruby, who was now on the floor shaking, Nathan went to check if there was anything they could do about the Demon tier weapon.

'If we bring this back to Supreme Commander Sach and the others, this will be a big help to us in the war.' Nathan concluded.

When looking in the river it made for a strange sight. Despite its weight it was floating at the top. From the tip, the river was frozen, while the other half of the river continued to flow.

One of the Earthborn group members was tempted to walk over the ice and go grab the weapon.

"Stop! Don't you know what will happen to you if you step on that ice?!" Nathan shouted, and they were quickly reminded of the weapon's true terrifying properties. Nathan's bubble had a few more uses, but they weren't combat related, but today seemed to be his day.

He coated himself in the bubble, and soon, jumped into the water. The current had weakened since half of the river was frozen, which was good but just in case, Nathan encased himself in a bubble so he wouldn't touch the wall of ice.

Eventually he reached the sword and grabbed it by it's hilt. He could feel a terrifying energy residing within, making him wonder how Ruby had even been able to use it. Eventually he returned to the ground, his clothes should have been drenched in water but the bubble seemed to also protect him from that. He now had the biggest smile on his face.

"The Demon tier sword! It's actually back in the hands of the Earthborn group! No, that's not right. I'm part of the Cursed and we are part of the human race. It's back in our hands. With this we can help out with the war going on!" Nathan exclaimed, before wrapping it up and placing it on his back. He had no sheath for the weapon so it stood out quite a bit.

——

After what had happened, the Earthborn group and those from the Shelter including Ruby had headed back to their secret hiding space. The Dalki body had been hard to dismember, so the only thing they had been able to do had been to tie it up to some heavy rocks and chuck it into the river hoping that it would take a long time until the enemy found it.

The group of soldiers and civilians were now in an open cleared area, where the nearby trees had been cut down, and there were a few tents. Not all of the three hundred men had stuck together, so this was just being used as a temporary space for Nathan and the others.

"You should hurry getting off this place." Ruby finally spoke. "Even if they don't find the body, the fact that we haven't come back yet, means that they will soon come looking for us. They will think we've escaped."

"I know, I have a rough understanding of your situation." Nathan said, bringing over a nice warm drink in a cup, placing it in her hands, The rest of the military group were doing the same. Hoping not to treat them as enemies, getting them to feel more comfortable and to speak more freely.

"Which is why I need you to tell me just what is going on? I'll be open with you. Just as you have already guessed we're from the military. I know that the ones who have come before have treated you unjustly and for that you have my deepest apologies, but we are here to get you out of this situation. Isn't this your best chance while One Horn isn't here?" Nathan asked.

The General spoke loudly on purpose, so the others nearby could hear, their reaction looked like they were quite pleased about what was said. Perhaps they did want to be saved, but they were waiting, waiting for Ruby to decide. It was clear that she was the one in charge around here.

There had to be a reason she was the one given the Demon tier weapon.

"Just tell them Ruby!" One of the men demanded. "I know Arthur helped us before, but this is the military we are talking about! They can help us."

Ruby clenched her fist and looked right past Nathan towards the one who had just spoken.

"Exactly, they're the same military who abandoned us at the first sign there was trouble! Do you remember who saved us from those beasts? It was Arthur! The military were the ones who had chosen to attack us!"

Hearing the name 'Arthur' Nathan was trying to recall if he had heard of someone of significance with that name, but there was no one who came to mind.

"Look, I promised I would answer your questions because you helped me from harming my fellow men, even if I can't agree with your methods." Ruby admitted in an angry tone. "The truth is… we don't really know what's going on at the moment, either. Arthur just came by and told us that we would be okay, that the Dalki would help us."

"It was hard to believe, but they kept their distance and they did protect us from beasts and the like. Eventually your military came and… well, you probably know the rest yourselves."

"You keep mentioning this Arthur. Is he someone we should know?" Nathan couldn't help but ask.

"The person who saved our lives The one who came here when the military had left this Shelter back when it was a red portal planet. He was the one who showed us how to fight back, helped us grow our community and we were able to live happy lives without caring about those outside. Then, he just came back one day, only with the Dalki as company."

"The only information we got from Arthur himself was that they would help us, and that the human race would lose the war against the Dalki. It was the only way that we would survive, because not even he could beat them."

It was clearly devastating news, to hear that this Arthur person that had saved them claimed he was unable to beat the Dalki, but there were plenty of people who would be afraid of fighting the Dalki, especially after what they were going through, so what was the big deal?

Nathan struggled to comprehend.

******


# Chapter 1230 The special deal
The questions from Nathan didn't stop there, as there was still plenty more that he needed to find out. First of all, just what type of deal had this Arthur person struck with the Dalki to make it so that they would protect humans?

It didn't really make any sense for those bloodthirsty creatures to suddenly change their nature. What reason could the Dalki possibly have to listen to his request, especially if Ruby and the others didn't lie about the part of him being stronger than them?

Unfortunately, Ruby and the others seemed to know next to nothing about this Arthur, apart that he had chosen to act as their benefactor. After some more questioning, Nathan finally stumbled upon something they could tell them and that was in regards to the powers Arthur had displayed.

Apart from Ruby the others had also confirmed that this Arthur person had used powers that sounded similar to the red aura used by the V, yet he seemed to have another power on top of that.

The shadow power he was apparently capable of using sounded awfully close to what he had seen some of the Cursed group use.

However, from the description it sounded as if Arthur had been an older gentleman, and the timeline of when he had first arrived at the Shelter didn't quite add up to the Cursed faction's founding.

'Is there a relation between Arthur and Quinn? I should ask him about it. Perhaps there is a traitor in the Cursed faction that Quinn doesn't know about?' Nathan thought.

"Do you think Arthur is a V then?" Nathan asked. Ruby gave him a look of utter confusion. When the others from the Shelter were asked the same thing, they reacted in the same way. It was clear they had no clue what a V was supposed to be.

'Don't tell me…'

As it turned out, this Shelter had been cut off from the outside world for far longer than Nathan and the others had realised. They had next to no electronics that would allow them to see, or know about current or past events.

"The Demon tier weapon, where did you get it from?" Nathan asked Ruby eventually.

"One Horn gave it to me after the battle. As for why he did that, your guess is as good as mine. I doubt he just did it because we helped the Dalki fight back against the military. I can only assume that he didn't consider me much of a threat, after all if even the Supreme Commander had been powerless against him, what chance would someone like me stand?" Ruby explained.

Nevertheless, the General thought there was more to it than that. One Horn must have known that given their plans of simultaneously attacking the planets he couldn't stay on this one forever. As such, Nathan assumed that he had done so to make sure they would keep their end of the deal with this mysterious Arthur. Dalki couldn't use beast gear, so leaving it to one of the people in the Shelter would boost their fighting power. Additionally, it had been a good way to sway those in the Shelter over to their side, building their trust.

It was scary to consider that the Dalki were capable of more than mere violence and the efficiency of his actions was apparent. Even amongst the five they had 'rescued', there were those that seemed to be still untrusting of the military, only complying reluctantly, seemingly grateful to the Dalki that had helped them previously.

'It's hard to blame them when the Earthborn group attacked them without giving it a second thought. In a way the Dalki are their saviours, but I still don't know what this Arthur could have given the Dalki to make them protect this Shelter...'

Moving away from the others, Nathan decided to take Ruby to the side. He had noticed that during his questioning, she kept looking over at the others and even they seemed to be a bit nervous as if they were being careful with the way they answered certain questions.

"I think you know what I'm going to ask you." Nathan began, looking at the face she was pulling once more. "I want to save the rest at your Shelter and bring them back to us. With your help, we can take down the Dalki. We know how strong their forces are."

"While it would have been risky before, now that we have recovered the Demon tier weapon, even the three spike Dalki will be easy to deal with. We have a great chance to do so with minimal lives lost." Nathan paused waiting for her to say something, but Ruby still remained silent.

"Look, Ruby, you have already given us all the information we could get from this place. You should understand that there is no logical reason for us to go and save the rest of your Shelter. It's been impossible to gather any information from the Dalki and I doubt that those left behind would know much anyway. I'm only doing this to try and right the wrong the military did to you all."

"We can't just leave this place, knowing that they have captured normal humans."

Nathan was actually exaggerating here. Even with the Demon tier sword back in their possession, it might be hard to fight off the three spiked Dalki, at least in a frontal confrontation. On the other hand, if the five of them were to return, Ruby could use the weapon to strike him from behind. With him out of the equation, they would have the manpower to defeat the others with minimal losses.

Of course, handing back the Demon tier weapon to Ruby was a risk. There was a chance she was still fighting for the other side so he needed to confirm her feelings, or what had been holding her back so far.

"I know, I know what you want me to do as well, but I can't." Ruby answered. "Because, I don't know where my daughter is…"

This was something that Nathan hadn't expected. This girl who he had come to learn was named Ruby, telling him they were using her daughter as a hostage. If the whole camp was being contained and protected, it would make no difference to put her daughter aside.

After all, fighting against the Dalki, or trying to rebel wouldn't make a difference since the Dalki could just defeat them with ease, so why take a hostage? Trying to put himself in the shoes of the others, Nathan could only think of one thing. It was to make sure that the special deal they had made would still go through, in case he changed his mind.

There had to be an external worry, and that couldn't be anyone in the camp, but must have had something to do with the initial goal of having those in the Shelter protected. They must have really wished for this Arthur person to be on their side no matter what.

'The second Arthur made the request for the Dalki to protect this place, they knew they could use something to barter with him, yet what is it that he has that they want?'

"Maybe I will be speaking from a military point of view, but we are taught to not think on an individual basis. I know it might be wrong for me to say this because I am not in your position and not taking your feelings into account, but right now you are being quite selfish.

"Are your views the same as everyone else's? If everyone in your Shelter learned that there was a chance for all of their lives to be saved and for their life to return to normal, do you think they would dislike that? From what we've seen, it's clear that the Dalki don't treat you like equals. If you carry on the way you are now, soon you will be nothing but slaves."

Nathan had said what he wanted to say, and now it was left up to Ruby to decide. He was sure there was a reason everyone looked up to her, and he was gambling that it was because she cared about the Shelter and their feelings.

Ruby had gone off with the others, they were all allowed to converse as they naturally did, but time was running out. If they wanted the element of surprise to be on their side against the Dalki then they needed to do so now.

It didn't take long, but Ruby had finally returned. "Tell me what I need to do."

——

A short while later, and the group of three hundred were put into action. They attacked the Shelter from multiple points in groups all at the same time. Due to the information they had received they were able to fare even better than they had originally believed.

Once she had chosen to cooperate fully, Ruby had been able to give them information on the Dalki's patrol paths, and even tell them the times when they would be further split apart.

Once their plan went into action Ruby had managed to play her part in everything splendidly. Rallying up those in the Shelter, and when coming out to 'help' The Dalki, she was able to use the Demon tier weapon to greatly injure the three spiked Dalki, albeit with tears in her eyes.

——

While everything was going on, even higher in the trees, sitting on a branch out of sight from nearly everyone, was a person.

"Sir, it looks like the military have returned to this place once again. Those in the Shelter have seemingly betrayed the Dalki. Without One Horn present it looks like the humans will be able to achieve a victory this time. Would you like me to help out the Dalki side?"

"No. Stay put. The outcome won't matter. He will be far too busy dealing with his own troubles, before he gets a chance to hear of this."

# Chapter 1231 The big figh
When the Cursed ship was still in orbit, having yet to crash land on Planet Caladi, interesting things were happening. Peter had quickly suffered a defeat from Hilston. Hardly any strength had been used in the fight.

Despite him being a Wight and having Quinn's stats, it all seemed like nothing against the one known as the world's strongest human. This was because he was also somewhat of a superhuman himself. Right now, every piece of equipment he wore on his body was shining brightly, as the properties of the Demon tier equipment were giving him additional stats.

"From your shouting, I thought you would amount to something at least, but I guess not," Hilston said.

It was then when Peter felt like he had no hope to beat such a titan that something strange had occurred. Crashing through the ceiling of the training room and slamming down onto the ground, it felt like the whole ship had tilted on its side for a second.

Something had landed in the centre of the training room.

Looking at its back, Peter could tell it was a Dalki. He could see an unusually long tail, but worse of all, he had counted the number of spikes on its back.

'How the hell did a five spike get in here?' Peter wondered. Looking above him, he could see a hole, but it didn't look to be a forced entry, almost as if someone had purposely made a hole so the Dalki would fall through to this exact spot. Seeing the tiny spiders at work and repairing the ceiling, Peter could only assume it was the work of Logan.

'I will have to thank him once again for saving my life for a second time.' Peter thought. Thankfully, his wounds had healed from the attack he had received. The good thing was that Peter hadn't been repeatedly hurt, so his hunger hadn't started to grow yet, but seeing the situation as it was, Peter soon found himself walking towards the side of the doors. As expected, one of them had opened, but only for him. Logan really was watching everything that was going on the ship.

'I hope the two of you kill each other.' Peter left because he knew staying there for any amount of time would be so at the risk of his own life.

The five spiked Dalki was a female Dalki known as Slicer. Her tail would constantly sway back and forth, similar to a dog. It was a sign she was overjoyed at the moment.

"I knew something was here!" Slicer declared with a big smile. "A strong energy unlike any other was calling to me, and now that I have seen you, I know exactly what it is. It's that armour! It's radiating with strength even now!"

While Slicer was still overjoyed at finding such a great person in front of her. Hilston wasted no time launching an attack. A streak of constant lightning soon had struck Slicer's body. Once it was done, it didn't stop there. Hilston continued to pour his MC cells into the attack.

"Why is an ugly lizard getting in my way now of all things!" Hilston said as he added more power to the attack. The whole room soon was filled with blue lighting, so much that if one was to enter, they would have been unable to see the Dalki or anything else for that matter.

Still, after a while, Hilton hadn't stopped his attack, and it was because he could tell something was up. Soon coming through the giant lightning attack, he could see a shadow walking towards him slowly, the tail shaking back and forth intensely.

The next second, a gap in the lighting could be seen. It was strange, it looked like the lightning strike had been cut, but Hilston hadn't seen anything of the sort. Refusing to believe that the Dalki was unaffected by such an attack, Hilston tried to use his lightning strike again. Regardless of this, a cut had been made in the lighting again, and Slicer was seen continuing to walk forward.

This time paying more attention, Hilston had seen it. For a brief second, her tail had stopped wagging back and forth. He could only assume that the tail was involved in disrupting the lightning.

"Excellent." Slicer said. "You are the one after all."

The attack wasn't ineffective. Just Slicer was too overjoyed and too focused to let something as minor as pain ruin her joyous moment.

She dashed forward with a scream, clearly intending to attack.

'A punch, or a kick, my armour will deal with those things.' Hilston thought, planning to match the attack with his own strength.

However, for a second, he had seen the tail stop for a moment. He had a feeling he knew what was about to happen, and something told him he needed to avoid it at all cost. The tail had struck, making no noise at all. It was back in place, swinging as it had done before.

In front of Slicer, she had expected to see a sliced up old man, but her tail had hit nothing but air. Before she knew it, a giant fist of flames was coming at her and had punched her on her side underneath her arm. Hilston had swung his fist like a hook and had used the firepower like a jet from his elbow to give the punch as much strength as possible.

It had worked, and Slicer was soon seen flying through the air. Until she had dug her tail into the ground, but it was too sharp and had done nothing but just cut the ground like butter, not slowing her down for a second.

Before she crashed into the wall, Hilston was soon seen behind her, aiming to deliver this time, two jet fire punches in her back. With as fast as the Dalki went through the air, it would mean even more power to a strike.

"I get it now. No human can move that fast. You must be using an ability." Slicer said. "But you're too predictable!"

It was then that she attacked with her tail behind her. She could tell it had hit something solid, but for the first time, her tail was stuck. It hadn't gone through the object or the person she was aiming at.

Hilston was only briefly sent through the air. He was able to use his teleportation ability to reposition himself again. Slicer was right. Hilston was using the power of teleportation to move. He could dodge attacks instantly and move as far as his eyes could see, as many times as he wanted consecutively.

'That blow, it was one hit, but it charged up the Demon tier equipment this much already?' Hilston thought, looking at his gauntlets. At the same time, Slicer was smiling, for she could feel that part of her scales from where Hilston had hit her, had fallen and she was bleeding slightly.

'This is it. This is exactly what I need!" Slicer shouted in pleasure. She charged in again, going for the attack, and as expected, Hilston started to teleport around the room. Before he could teleport, he struck a lightning strike at her wound. Then, when appearing by her side or back, he would use flame filled attacks. One after another.

Doing this constantly at a fast speed, Slicer couldn't catch a break, but the more she got injured, the stronger she was getting. Soon, her tail was being used more than she had ever had to in a fight before. Hitting Hilston with great speed each time he appeared. Her tail had never been stopped by anything before. Yet today, It had constantly failed to cut the strong special diamond armour.

'This is it, this fight. The fight where I have to fight with my life on the line. This is the fight that will allow me to evolve!' She thought.

It was then that Hilston was finding something oddly strange. With his attacks, he wasn't holding back. Anyone would have been killed with a single hit, but this Dalki was still standing, and her attacks were getting stronger and faster.

For a second, Hilston was reminded of the last fight he had lost. Something was coming over him. It wasn't like when he fought the other one, and was so overpowered that he was unable to do anything. No, instead, this felt like a wall that was continuing to grow larger and more robust.

"No…I will not lose again!" Hilston shouted. His armour had now charged up, and he was finally ready to use one of the pieces of its active skill. However, it was at this point that the ship had crashed.

Trying to not get hurt, Hilston teleported away to safety while the ship continued to bounce across the sand. At one point, Slicer appeared above and dug her feet into his shoulders.

'While I'm in contact with another, I can't teleport!' Hilston angrily thought.

He soon was seen being pulled out of the ship, with blood dripping from his traps, covering the shoulders of his armour. When they were a distance away from the ship. Hilston grabbed the legs, and the armour around his arms started to glow. They had delivered a strange pulse.

A strange feeling had come over the Dalki, making it drop Hilston into the sand. With Hilston safely landing as well.

Slicer quickly landed herself and stood opposite the Dalki, but her joyous face from before had disappeared.

"You, you need to get stronger. You need to hurt me more. Otherwise, I won't evolve. If I can evolve, I will be ahead of the others and can be the overall leader of the Dalki. So hurt me, hurt me more!" She shouted.

"You think you're a challenge to me. You were never a challenge in the first place." Hilston said, as he activated the Demon tier armour set active skill.

# Chapter 1232 Alien VS Predator
The drones being used to livestream the fight between the 'strongest human' and one of the Dalki leaders weren't ordinary. In fact, both Bonny and Void had invested their life savings into purchasing these robots. The two of them had started together from the bottom. They used to be no names in the entertainment industry and rather than going through the traditional means, they had decided to build themselves from the ground up by starting their own channel and news outlet.

It was only later they had been picked up and given a dedicated live channel that could be broadcasted on world channels as well. Through the years they had learned a lot, and over the years had continued to reinvest their earnings into their equipment, making their reporting game above anyone else. Besides they were after all, one of the few daring enough to put themselves in dangerous situations.

Each one of Void's drones might have cost an arm and a leg, but they were literally the best money could buy, able to survive through thunderstorms and more. Nevertheless, it didn't mean they were indestructible, nothing in the world was, but they could take quite the beating under normal circumstances.

Of course, any one attack from Slicer or Hilston would be more than enough to take them out, but thankfully Void's control over them was superb. He moved them as if they were extensions of his own body, allowing him to get them in the right places to offer the best viewing experience while simultaneously keeping them out of the danger zone. His concentration was always in top shape, it helped due to how much these drones cost in the first place.

So far, the drones had survived all the chaos, taking the whole world along for the ride. Filming every aspect of the fight since the Cursed ship.

"Did you see the powers that Blade person used? Teleportation, Fire and Lightning! Each one of them was top tier!"

"Top tier? Have we been watching the same fight? That was far beyond the top tier! Why would a person this strong stay hidden this whole time? With his power he could have had anything he wanted!"

"I know they are saying he's done bad things, but does it really matter at this moment. We need everyone we can to fight against the Dalki."

Those online were fascinated by the strong powers displayed by Hilston Blade and despite Bonny revealing the Blade family's negative past, the support of the people was with him. In a way, it was natural when seeing a human fight against a Dalki that the public would be on his side.

Out of the two, Slicer was the first to make her next move, by dashing forward again. To the viewers it appeared as if she was simply repeating the same pattern over and over. One would think that she hadn't learned her lesson, but as her opponent, Hilston could feel the difference. Each time, one of them was able to catch a break. The fighting positions of them both reset to how they first started. Despite the moves being the same, Slicer came at him slightly stronger each time.

This time, Hilston did something different hoping to change the outcome. He moved his hand and the next second a giant wave of sand could be seen swallowing Slicer whole, but just like everything else so far, the Dalki leader used her tail to cut through the obstacle to reach her target.

However, following after the sand was part of the ship that was being hurled at her again and again. Large and small pieces of all shapes and sizes, They wern;t being thrown one by one either. Multiple parts were moving in all sorts of different directions. She was able to avoid or take most of the blows head on. Some of the times would simply bounce off her hard skin, but for a second, she could feel that her tail had slowed down.

'What is this strange force I can feel. Is it an ability? For me to actually feel a difference...' Slicer was quite surprised.

Pushing through with her strength she could move her tail still, the Dalki cut another wave of sand, only to find a piece of metal from the ship hitting her with great force, more so than all the items before, and lifting her into the air.

'It's best not to show your entire strength.' Hilston thought with a smile, pleased how his simple plan had worked out.

Whenever, Hilston got the chance, he would rain down lightning on the Dalki like he was doing now in the air, but for the first time it looked as if this ability was completely ineffective.

'I knew it, this person still has tricks up his sleeve! Yes, this is what I was waiting for!' Slicer thought, a pleased distorted smile on her face. 'The lightning attacks hardly harm my body anymore, but they must be draining his energy.'

Not many people had fought against a five spike Dalki or had lived to get up close to one and speak again.So they had no way of knowing that five spikes were a little different. Their bodies would be altered slightly. The scales on their outer body tripled in thickness and strength, making most attacks feel like nothing, which was why the lightning wasn't affecting Slicer in the same way it would have done others.

"That ability he just used, that had to have been Telekinesis, right? That would make it the fourth ability he has used so far!" Someone commented on the livestream.

In the air, Slicer soon slashed the metal object that was propelling her into the air. She had split it up into several parts, but didn't expect for now all the separate pieces to be going towards her. Moving her tail even faster she continued to cut them into smaller and smaller pieces until they were no longer moving. Now mid air, she started to fall, until from her back, large wings sprouted. Wings were already a rarity among the Dalki, yet Slicer was even more unique in that she was able to retract them at will.

For the first time, the female Dalki changed her tactics. Rather than attacking Hilston by running straight forward from the ground, she was making use of her wings and flew at him at a speed faster than her previous top one.

"Come on, most of your attacks still haven't been able to even hurt me that bad!" Slicer taunted her opponent. Hilston knew that she wasn't lying. So far, the only thing that had been effective, had been the fire ability mixed in with his natural raw strength supported from the demon tier armour.

Unfortunately, getting a hold of her had proven to be a real headache. Planting his first into the lizard's body would be a hard task. Given how fast Slicer currently was, it was incredibly hard for the strongest human to physically hit her. Fortunately, the lightning attacks moved at speed surpassing hers, just like the telekinesis ability which was why Hilston didn't show any signs of panic. Still these were ineffective which was why he was at a standstill.

When Slicer was close enough, around an arm's reach away, a large pulse radiated from his armour. The force itself could be seen as a ripple moving through the sky. It didn't move fast, nor did it spread out too wide, but for those inside its range, it was impossible to escape the attack.

Just like everything Slicer had seen before, she attempted to slash through this invisible pulse. When the tip of her tail touched it, an instinct surfaced which she hadn't felt in a long time.

'This, it was exactly the same skill he had used when I had him held up in the air.' She thought.

When it passed through her whole body, there was nothing she could do. Her body became unable to move and the female Dalki was falling down. However, whilst in mid-air Hilston followed up with a double hammer fist of flames, slamming her into the ground making a tide of sand shoot up into the sky.

The livestream that was being shown to the viewers played out a frame rate that was usually used to film slow motion videos. Otherwise, many wouldn't be able to fathom what was going on, and would be unable to see such a lightning fast fight in real life, but they could all see it through the screen. It was unbelievable everything they were seeing at the event was nail biting for them all.

They were unsure just what was going to happen next or how it would all play out.

******

# Chapter 1233 Alien Vs Predetor Part 2
The strange pulse that was felt coming from Hilston had stopped Slicer in her tracks. As soon as it hit her, a tingling feeling was felt in her body that she just couldn't shake off and soon, she felt her whole body going numb. This was what had allowed her to receive a devastating blow.

Still, it didn't take long after the attack for Slicer to dig her way out of the sand, even though Hilston was using his Telekinesis to bury her deeper by the second. She was soon seen shooting out from the ground, blood falling from her back, and it partially seared from the attack.

"That one hurt a bit! You got anymore like that in you?!" Slicer continued her taunting, before she jumped into the air once more. The five spiked Dalki was far more injured than she herself realised and her body had started to tilt during her flight, making her come in at an odd angle, but it didn't matter to her.

Hilston activated his Demon tier's Armour special set skill once more and the pulse went outward. Although she couldn't see the attack, she could feel that the armour had done something and remembering what had just happened, she tried to find a gap of some sort.

The invisible pulse was coming out like a bubble hitting everything in the area. Only a slight change could be seen if one was to look closely similar to a heatwave on a hot day. Slicer flapped her wings with all her power in an attempt to get outside of its possible range, but eventually she got hit, causing her body to freeze again.

With Hilston's Teleportation ability, he was soon in front of her, and happily delivered another flame punch to her face. After teleporting again, his next punch was aimed at her side and he continued to pummel her. The teleportation attacks with the flame punches were proving to be effective. Getting hit another time, Slicer's anger had risen and she bore through the effects swinging her tail out at the same time, hearing a familiar clang.

That was the sign that his active skill had stopped working, and Hilston increased the distance between the two of them again.

"You damn cheat! Stop running away and fight me fair and square!" Slicer demanded in her fury, her appearance looking more and more like a piece of charcoal.

"My armour is merely a tool, just like my abilities, as are your wings and your tail. There is no honour in a fight, just a winner!" Hilston stated.

What he was using was the active armour skill called Disruptive pulse. It was a set of Demon tier armour all with the same skill. However, its range and area where it worked was limited if one only had one part of the Demon tier set. For example, the armour covering his hands only allowed him to use the skill on physical touch, which was what he had done the first time, but when having the whole armour set on, one could affect everything in a certain area.

Disruptive pulse was a Demon tier active skill that even Hilston didn't know every use of. So far it had stopped any ability that was touched by the pulse, a person's actions, beasts and more. This Demon tier set was perfect for someone like Hilston, allowing him to use his strongest moves against his enemies while they were frozen in place, at the same time, disrupting his opponents most powerful moves.

Nevertheless, there was a small downside to it. The armour he was wearing needed to be charged up, something that only happened after it had received a certain amount of damage. The stronger the opponent, the quicker that happened and only then was he able to use the active skills.

The watching community was going crazy cheering on Hilston to beat the five spiked Dalki. They had yet to really grasp Slicer's strength, so most could not truly understand the great feat that was happening at the moment.

Hilston continued to fight in this style using the active skill and his strong abilities, mainly the fire one to pound his enemy, his fists were seen being covered in green blood. Even though Slicer's strength was rising, it didn't matter as she had yet to find a way to get out of the pulse. Each time it went through her body she became defenceless, unable to fight against it.

Given her personality and pride as a Dalki leader she wasn't one to run away either, but finally, for some reason, Hislton had stopped using it; he had stopped using the pulse. This was first noticed by Slicer when her attack had gotten through and it wasn't just a hit out of desperation this time. Still, it had only clashed against his armour.

Hilston had blocked the attack from his head, another attack followed up from Slicer and he barely blocked that one too. The third strike came at an angle that would be impossible to block, so instead the Blade leader teleported away.

Slicer, slightly surprised about the sudden reversal, quickly figured out the situation. Then she started to laugh to herself. "Now I understand. You can't do that weird thing anymore, can you?" Slicer questioned him, yet Hilston didn't bother to give her an answer.

There was no need for it either as the circumstances spoke for themselves.

Hilston had long since expected the Dalki to fall before him, but she had proven far more resilient than he had ever anticipated, able to survive even his strongest abilities. This was the very first time someone had been able to last long enough that the charges of Disruptive pulse had actually run out. Now he was forced to stay on the defensive and wait for the attacks to charge it back up. Which was why he was also reluctant to use his teleportation ability.

It was then that Slicer did something strange that no one had expected. Using her long tail, she aimed at the base, the tip skimmed around the edge, and the next second it could be seen falling into the sand. Blood started to spew everywhere, dying the sand green. The wound quickly healed, until she let out a shriek and a new tail grew in its place.

Slicer quickly did this two more times, chopping off her tails, regrowing a new one, each one looking more impressive than the last and even longer. Then picking up both of her tails, she held them in her hands.

It was a gruesome sight to see, a Dalki using its own body part as some type of weapon, but at the same time, for those watching it just sent a shiver down their spine. Showing just how blood hungry they were, to not even give it a second thought to do such a thing.

"Why won't that thing die! So much of its blood has been split!" A viewer commented.

"I haven't gotten to a six spike yet, So I need to push myself even further!" Slicer said, with bloodshot eyes. Although her approach seemed to be a double-edged sword, her current tail was double the size of the one had originally had but even she didn't know how much longer she would last with so little Dalki blood left inside her.

——

Not too far away from where the fight was taking place, A small group could be seen walking in the sand.

"It looks like everyone who was around the Cursed ship has left this place." Fex commented. Looking at the dead human and Dalki bodies around. Most of them were the Chained, but there were a few humans from the Cursed group as well.

Fex was soon seen wrapping them up, mummifying them with his string. His strings even though they looked light, could be used as quite the weight. On the way back, they would make sure to give their bodies a proper funeral. Right now, the members of the cursed faction had an important job to do, and among them was determined Sil, who was ready to make his move.

******

# Chapter 1234 Pick a side
After dealing with the threat of the Dalki in the Shelter, the Cursed members had finally been able to catch a break for a bit. Without the fighting it even seemed peaceful as long as one didn't think about what was currently happening on the other human planets. The place had already been evacuated beforehand, but with only those from the Cursed ship currently occupying the Shelter, it resembled a ghost town.

"Has the fighting really ended. Is it safe?" Someone asked.

"I guess so. Wouldn't the Dalki be coming out now if it wasn't the case?" Another replied.

The people were discussing the shocking events that had occurred to them. Some were cursing in anger, while others were in tears. Everyone was happy that they had just narrowly escaped death, but now that they were all safe, they had time to really process the loss of their close friends and loved ones.

Many were running around the Shelter delivering the good news, while also trying to find those close to them. It was a large place after all. Still, everything just felt a bit unorganised.

"So, what are we going to do now?" Fex asked. "Should we round up everyone and head back to the Cursed ship? I bet Logan can repair it given enough time."

When the question was asked, it was naturally directed towards Quinn. Unfortunately, the Cursed faction leader had gone back to acting as his weird self.

"It's really not my place to say, but if you still want my opinion, then I would suggest that the best thing to do is to meet up with Sam. He usually has a clear head on what to do next, and as for the... let's say 'real Quinn', you don't have to worry about him. As long as this body remains in a safe place then everything will be fine."

Vincent was unable to see what was happening to the Dalki body Quinn was occupying, nor did he know where his grandson was right now. However, what he did know was that the energy in his Vampire Lord's body was no longer being drained. Without that burden, Vincent was surprised given the rate Quinn's body was producing energy, making him wonder if it had anything to do with the special Qi, or perhaps it was something else.

'I guess Quinn must have managed to deal with his enemy on his side, but if that was true, why hasn't he returned?'

It didn't take long for the group to locate Sam and the others, as Vincent still remembered where they had previously been. Layla and Nate were also back on their feet again. Nevertheless, neither one was in any real fighting condition. While they walked on their own, they did so with sore muscles, aches, pains and more.

When the two groups met up, Sam was taken aback. In particular due to the presence of two familiar looking faces with blonde hair.

"Don't worry, they have decided to stay with us and promised to behave." Vorden explained.

Although Raten didn't exactly seem pleased, Sam trusted those around them to keep an eye on the twins. Especially Borden, who was back to regular human size, made it clear that he was watching their every move. On the way to Sam, there had already been a few times that Borden had mistaken their actions and warned them. Neither one of the two had been pleased, but both of them understood that the vigilance wasn't unfounded.

"I've already contacted Logan and he said that a few repairs have to be made before the Cursed ship will be able to fly again." Sam shared with the group. "Unfortunately, the teleporters don't seem to be working in the Shelter, just like in all the other places I guess. According to the information we have received, there has to be some type of jammer on the mothership."

"Then let's take down the ship!" Raten suggested in a fighting mood.

Looking around though, there weren't really many that were in fighting condition, even when Sam met up with Vincent he shook his head insinuating it was a bad idea.

"Actually, I think I might be able to help with that." Vincent remembered there was something that Quinn had done, and perhaps it could be used now more than ever. Using the dimensional space soon a strange long stick with a large crystal on the end appeared in front of everyone. It was clear to them all it was something they had never seen before. It took a few seconds until Sam was the first one to catch on to the strange design of the object.

"That… is that Dalki tech? It uses the same black material and the engraved swirls and spikes." Sam theorised, pointing towards the top.

"Quinn… ahem, when 'I' was on the mothership, I decided to place it in my shadow. I thought that maybe we could use it to create a jammer of some type." Vincent explained, catching himself in the moment. Since he had yet to explain to the new group they had now met up with.

By now, everyone was already aware that this person in front of them wasn't the 'real Quinn'. However, the fact that he was in his body and continued to help them made them trust whoever it was enough to continue playing along. In the first place, it didn't seem likely that they would get a better answer, unless Vincent decided to spill the beans himself.

"I think it would be best if we hand this over to Logan. He was already doing research into the situation. With this thing, maybe he can figure something out. The people should stay inside the Shelter. It's relatively safe for now. Dennis, Megan, Shiro, I want you three to stay behind. For one, someone still needs to look after these two." Sam pointed at Layla and Nate, who looked sad, but neither one argued, aware of their own situation.

"On top of that, make sure the Blade kids don't do anything either. Although they are with Grim, he isn't in the best shape either. I know you are good at dealing with them, Shiro. If the place is attacked I need you to report it ASAP to us. The rest of us will head to the Cursed ship."

——

The group followed Sam's orders, so they headed to the Cursed ship. Sam thought that perhaps they would need some strength to deal with the Dalki that had boarded the Cursed ship.

He had considered the possibility of running into a bunch of them, so he felt a little safer with the people who were by his side, but just like Borden, he couldn't yet completely trust the two newcomers, Pai and Vicky.

When arriving, the site turned out to be nothing like they had expected. All of the Dalki had already been dealt with. Their dead bodies lay scattered around the ground in the sand. Entering the Cursed ship, they were greeted to a similar scene inside.

It was a sad sight to behold, for a lot of them this place had been their home, yet now it was ruined, most places no longer even recognisable. When reaching Logan, in the command centre, they were happy to see that he was safe. Handing over the strange device, Logan became overjoyed and got to work almost immediately.

However, the group noticed something playing in the command centre, something that Logan had been watching this entire time. Several eyes in the room lit up, and their hearts beat harder as they saw it, it was the fight against Slicer and Hilston.

"Hilston, he's winning." Vicky said, her body shaking, her mind was a bit of a loss of what to do. Pai, who had gained consciousness a while ago, was just staring at the screen having no such reactions. Until he noticed something before the others.

"You need to stop him!" Pai pleaded as he turned around, looking towards Vorden.

Vorden wasn't sure what the other expected him to do, but he suddenly noticed that someone had gone missing from their group.

"Goddamnit, where is Sil?!"

Everyone turned around, but he was nowhere to be seen, so most of the Cursed group quickly headed outside to search for him, leaving Logan to do what needed to be done.

"What is he planning to do now?" Fex grumbled.

"Isn't it obvious? He's going to join the fight." Peter replied.

Vicky and Pai had been the first to find the missing Sil. He had remained standing outside in the sand. Only once they had reached him did they see what he was doing, making them stop in their tracks and do the same.

Once the others finally reached where the Blade family were standing, they could see that they were watching the fight in the distance.

"Sil." Vicky asked. "What are you going to do?"

******

# Chapter 1235 Your own kind
The Cursed group were standing on top of a large sand dune. In the distance, they were able to see the fighting that was still ongoing at this very moment. The participants didn't seem to notice their presence, either because the group was too far away, or because they were forced to fully concentrate on their opponent.

The fight was heating up with every passing second, and large explosions of power were being released one after another. The Cursed group was still within a distance that allowed them to smell the blood coming off Hilston and the Dalki, at least those that were vampires.

They had been standing there for a while now and had witnessed Hilston get the upper hand over Slicer due to his Demon tier armour's active skill.

"That skill is so strong, I wonder what it would do to my strings?" Fex wondered.

"I could just walk through it, it's the hard armor that I'm impressed with." Peter replied.

Hearing this, Pai couldn't help but laugh at the two of them.

"That skill is extremely powerful. Not only would your strings fall to the floor or disintegrate but the second that pulse went through your bodies you would be unable to feel anything. It's impossible to fight it, and at the same time, as you can see, not even that Dalki can cut through the armour."

"Shut up you big brain, you're in the same situation as us." Raten complained. "You know, if he turns to us, I'm telling them you joined our side, so get ready to fight for your life, and use that knowledge to beat him."

Pai quickly went silent, and their eyes were back on the fight.

However, they noticed that Hilston's advantage had suddenly disappeared, and for a while now, he had gone on the defensive, both sides seemed to be struggling greatly.

Slicer, using two seperated tails as whips, was swinging them at a speed just as great as she would use her own tail, but thanks to Hilston's teleportation, he could quickly escape, and try his best to attack using his abilities.

Getting in close, he would use the telekinesis to slow down the attack. He did so after a swing from one of Slicer's tails and threw out a fist of his own. However, using the enormous tail she had regrown, Slicer wrapped around Hilston and was gripping on to him tightly.

Trying to get out of the situation, Hilston's whole body was lighting up in flames, until eventually Slicer had no choice but to let go. Even through her skin, the fire seemed to be getting stronger and would eventually even affect her unlike the lightning attacks. Nevertheless, she didn't give up and threw one of her tails like a spear straight towards Hilston.

Lifting up his hands, he stopped it mid-flight, but was too slow to see the large tail, sweeping below and going in for the attack again and again. The good news was, it was just hitting his armour and unable to damage him.

"This fight is crazy. They seem to have already surpassed most Vampire family leaders." Fex commented with his mouth left wide open. It was now moving at an unprecedented pace and all of those watching imagined themselves on the receiving end of any of these attacks. All of them estimated that they might get defeated in a matter of seconds. The power of the big four were in Hilston's hands, and they were even boosted and stronger, yet he was still unable to take out the Dalki.

This wasn't the only thing, even Hilston's physical strength could match the vampire leaders. Peter knew this for a fact, because he had felt the power behind just one of Hilston's hits. If one was to watch the sand around them carefully they could tell, because with each punch, the sand was being dragged and lifted, thrown all over the place.

"You told me to come over to your side, but can you see now why I can't?" Vicky questioned as she clenched her fist. Everyone could hear what she was saying but none got involved because this was a matter for the members of the Blade family.

"He is the strongest in the world! That Dalki is covered in blood and might be putting up a good fight, but she still can't even scratch him! Do you really think you can do anything against such a monster, Sil?" Vicky continued to speak, expecting an answer.

Although both members of the family, neither Vorden nor Raten considered this to be a place for them to say anything. Instead, they looked at Sil who had both his hands clenched and was looking at the fight, waiting for the right time to make a move.

'I wonder what you are thinking, Sil. It's always been hard to understand you.' Vorden thought.

Despite the fact that Hilston could no longer use his active skill Disruptive pulse, he was fighting better than he had done before with the use of the abilities. There were a lot of people that were worried about him once they had seen Slicer separate her tails to grow the current enormous one.

By using the ones she had discarded as weapons, it was now as if Hilston was fighting against three different Slicers. However, just like Slicer had been growing proportionate to the damage she had received, something similar was happening to Hilston, who was fighting with his life on the line.

Rather than using the abilities raw powers to finish off his opponents, he had to try to come up with combinations. He was forced to use his head to a degree. He could even feel the cells in his body growing more active. His survival instincts were kicking in and rather than his body choosing to run away, it was using this fight to allow the strongest human to grow even stronger.

Unknown to him, these cells activating through his whole body were Qi. Qi, beyond anyone's imagination, was running through him making him superhuman. This was why he could match up to Slicer for so long.

'The Blade family will always keep growing, and even now we will get stronger and stronger!' Hilston thought. 'Soon the armour will be charged again, and once the Disruptive pulse is ready, I will finish this oversized lizard off!'

At that moment, meeting up with the others on the sand dune were Bonny and Void. Void had his camera out and straight away zoomed in on the action that was going on in front of them. He didn't greet the others, or explain anything, he would let Bonny do the talking.

"What are the two of you doing here? Didn't I tell you to stay in the Shelter?" Sam questioned, shocked and also a little angry, they decided to ignore his orders. The two of them looked safe having no injuries on their body, but if there was even a single Dalki they had missed, the two of them could have easily died.

"We've lost two of our drones. It's getting more intense and even with Void's control they were hit. There is a good chance that all of the cameras will be lost if it continues. Practically everyone is watching this fight and we can't just sit around and not deliver its conclusion!" Bonny explained, making it apparent that they would stay here, their pride as reporters demanding it.

Sam sighed and agreed to their request, but refused to comment on anything while the fight was going on, to the camera that was. He soon saw one of the drones returning, now there was one drone filming the fight, and Void's personal camera, while the drone that returned was looking at the Cursed members.

——

Inside the lab where Graham and Quinn were present they could see the camera view switch. For a second the camera had panned over to all those in the Cursed faction that were watching the fight. Bonny wanted to get the live reactions of them all. This allowed Quinn to see his own body.

'Vincent, I told you to protect them, what are you doing bringing them to such a place?' Quinn thought, wanting to slap his forehead.

The Dalki looked to be heavily injured and covered in blood. Seeing this Quinn smiled thinking that even a five spike could be injured. However his smile quickly disappeared as he remembered that the Cursed faction were in a huge mess due to Hilston in the first place, and if Hilston was to win, he would soon be after them straight after.

"Was that a smile, are you smiling because you think your own race is going to lose?" Graham asked.

******

# Chapter 1236 I picked a side
"I didn't believe it, but you're really rooting against your own kind? Seeing one of us turn traitor is interesting in its own way and I look forward to finding out one way or the other what they did to you. Still, let me ask you, do you really think that Slicer will lose?" Graham asked.

Hearing this, Quinn thought that Graham was oddly confident. It was hard to tell through camera the sheer battle that was going on, but Quinn thought for sure that Slicer had to be at her limit, especially after she had seemingly fallen into a frenzied state making her harm herself.

Now experiencing fighting as a Dalki, Quinn could guess how far a Dalki could push themselves, even with the added energy from blood loss, and strength it could only take them so far.

"She can push herself further. Maybe one more will do." Graham mumbled. "That Demon tier Armour has been troublesome, but we are stronger than Demon tier beasts."

Hearing this, from someone who Quinn had suffered a humiliating defeat against, he could believe it. However, they were going against a man that had a full set of Demon tier Armour, this person was also stronger than Demon tier beasts.

——

It was then, for the third time in the fight, that Slicer chose to hurt herself. Her latest tail proved to be more resilient than the previous ones, forcing her to attack it multiple times, before it fell to the ground.

Without the Disruptive pulse, Hislton was being careful to get close. After all, all he needed to do was bide his time.

More blood stained the ground and it took a while for another tail to replace the old one. Through the blood loss, she felt her mind hazing. In order to snap out of it, she stomped both feet on the ground. Screaming soon after, the tail could be seen moving, it was the original size of the first one, but didn't stop there. Under her pained shrieks it slowly continued to elongate until reaching three times her body size. The scales on her body had been ruined, her inner bones had been broken multiple times but had healed again and again.

Her energy was at an all-time high, but she was struggling to keep her mind clear. Still her eyesight was set on the enemy in front of her. She could practically feel the sixth spike coming after defeating him.

'It's there…I know it's there…I will be the first one…the strongest one!'

Charging in like she had done before, she was ready to come in, and when she was within range, she spun her body, and the large tails spun with her, at the last second the large tail connected to her, extended out coming down on Hilston like a hammer.

'This is it, with this attack, the armour will be charged again!' Hilston believed, teleporting into place, and raising his arms so they were in the right position. He had a huge grin on his face as he was ready to use Disruptive pulse the moment it would be available.

However, this time there was no 'clang' sound at all. Instead, his hands were no longer attached to his body, cut off cleanly they were now lying in the sand. It didn't stop there, as the colossal tail was used for another strike. Following his instincts, Hilston didn't even try to use an ability, instead jumping back. Despite its size, Slicer's newest tail was faster than any of the others. It hit the chest piece, leaving behind a giant slash, from which diamonds dropped to the ground.

As this happened, Hilston could feel the accumulated energy fade away. Using the distance he had just won, Hilston teleported himself out of there, as far as he could. It was done in a panic and he didn't really register that he was falling back.

Seeing this, Slicer extended her tail and swung her body in a circle, cutting everything around, another clang was heard, and Hilston was seen being flung through the air, falling to the ground. His armour that he had worn this whole time had been cut in half. Due to how heavy it was, it had fallen off him falling to the ground. Now a large wound was visible across his entire torso, painting it red.

"The Dalki, it's gotten so much stronger." Sam gasped. "Hilston, he's…he's going to lose!"

"No, that can't be! How could he lose to a lizard like that?! He was just caught off guard, he had to be tired after how long they were fighting for." Vicky sounded like she was now making up excuses for him.

"That's not it. I've never seen Hilston take a fight so seriously before." Pai spoke. "If it was the old Hilston, he would have lost this fight a lot sooner, but he actually fought with great tactics, his moves were faster and he had access to some of the strongest abilities in the world. It's just… the power of the Dalki was stronger…"

It was something hard to admit, and even though her twin brother Pai was saying these words, she still didn't believe it. Hilston had to still have something up his sleeve, something that would turn this fight around, she just knew it.

Void soon zoomed the camera into Hilston's wound, his body was far more hurt then the others thought as well. They could see it now the armour had fallen off. Despite the armour he was wearing, his body was swollen and bruised from all the attacks, all showing different colours. Despite blocking them his body still ended up like this. The force of the blows were unimaginable.

That was when on the camera itself, it had picked a certain person, who was standing there by Hilston side. It appeared suddenly.

They could only see the back of his head, but the others knew who it was.

"Sil!" Sam shouted out.

Sam wanted to stop him, but he knew that if he tried to get in Sil's way what could he honestly do. No amount of thinking in this situation would help them.

——

"Isn't this one of the ones from the Cursed faction? I've seen them fighting a few times on Bonny's live stream." A user commented.

"Yeah I think she said that he was a Blade as well, only working for the Cursed faction. Has he come to help?"

"With the two of them, maybe they can defeat the five spiked Dalki. Yeah, we can win this fight, beating one of their strongest!"

"But if he's actually strong, then why did he come join the fight only now? Couldn't he have come to support the Blade guy in the middle of it? Also, why is he just standing there?"

The online community was in high spirits, until they could see Sil looking at Hilston on the ground, not turning to look at the Dalki for even a second. At the same time the spinning from Slicer's attack had caused her to be slightly wobbly on her feet as well. She knew the condition her opponent was in, so he wasn't going anywhere soon.

——

"I've always dreamed about this moment. I've thought about what I would say to you, if I ever got this chance. For the longest time, I just wanted you to tell me why you did everything you did. Why you decided to put everyone through that on Blade Island. There had to be a reason, right? A reason that could justify your actions… but is there really anything that can justify everything you did? One day, the hope inside me that there might be one, just disappeared, so there is no point asking you that."

"You don't deserve to live another second on this planet, you're just a crazy weak old man! This is for Caser! I never forgot what you did to him that day, and now I am going to do the same to you." Sil said his piece, before Hilston could even react to him appearing. After shoving his hand through Hilton's chest, he pulled out a still beating heart.

"Goodbye, 'gran…no…father'." Sil spat mockingly before he squeezed the organ in his hand, causing it to pop on the spot.

******

# Chapter 1237: The real end
Hilston might have been the strongest human, but his unprotected organ stood no chance against Sil's strength. In his last moment, he looked at Sil, a plethora of emotions in his eyes. What was strange though, was a grin had appeared as if he was expecting this moment to come at some point. Falling to the floor, the Blade leader lay dead in the sand.

Sil had never imagined that the person he had been so afraid of for most of his life, the one person who had made his life a living hell, forcing him to kill his own friends would die just like that. Sil had always believed that one day he might be able to grow strong enough to defeat him in a fight, but for some reason this kind of ending didn't feel right.

At the moment, he really didn't know how to feel at all. He had expected to feel great joy about finishing him off or maybe some sort of sadness. After all, for all the cruel things he had done for him, there had been rare moments of the person who had looked after them, made him call them

'grandpa' had gone, but instead he just felt empty.

'Is this what revenge is supposed to feel like? Should I have asked you a few questions after all or would it have just been worse, listening to you justify your selfish wish of growing stronger, no matter the cost?'

Seeing this, Slicer, who had been fighting Hilston up to this point, started to laugh out loud. She couldn't believe that a human of all things was the reason for this person's death. Perhaps some other Dalki would have been angry, but Slicer had already gotten her use out of Hilston.

The moment she had managed to slice off his arms, thereby managing to overwhelm the Demon tier Armour, the winner in this fight had been determined. Even if she would have continued to fight him, it would have been near impossible for Hilston to further aid her in her evolution anymore. As such, she didn't care if someone else claimed the kill.

Not having to fight him any longer also had its upside. Slicer was in an incredibly weak state, yet at the same time, this made her all the more dangerous.

——

Meanwhile, everyone watching at home couldn't believe this sudden interference in the fight.

"What the hell?! Why did he kill the old dude who was fighting the Dalki?! I always knew that they weren't on our side!"

"Someone, kill them! The Cursed faction are traitors to humanity! Why would they stop us from killing a five spike Dalki? If the two of them teamed up they could have weakened their forces!"

"The Cursed are always up to something strange. Up until now, I believed that the Cursed faction were the good V, but now I see it was all just for show. They must have been working with the Dalki all along!"

"Did you already forget what happened at the start of the broadcast? The Blade family has come in and attacked the Cursed faction ship, remember? They were trying to kill them!"

"So what? The Blade family were trying to kill the Cursed, not the human race! Even if they have differences, why not go for the Dalki first? Besides, for all we know, the Blade family were trying to get rid of the Cursed because they were working for the V!"

Swayed up in their emotions, everyone was filled with anger. They had never seen such a fight before and they were pissed off for it to come to such an unsatisfying ending. It was clear to them that this Dalki was far more dangerous than any other, but from what they had seen Hilston had proven to be far more powerful than any world leader, yet the actions of a single boy from the Cursed faction had not only allowed this dangerous creature to live, but had also robbed them of the one person with the best chance to defeat it.

——

Inside the strange science lab, Quinn had seen it all as well. He was surprised, but at the same time not.

'Sil, you finally got your revenge, but by the look on your face, I guess you were expecting for it to have more meaning.' Quinn thought. He too had experienced his fair share of getting bullied, fighting back those that had once beaten him.

It wasn't as extreme as what Sil or the other Blade children had gone through, but he had come to the realisation that despite at one point gaining the power to punish them, that it wasn't really what he was looking forward to anymore. If he had gotten revenge on his bullies at that point, he would have turned out no better than them, so instead he had concentrated to improve his own situation and that of those around him.

As a weakling Quinn had had dreams about having power, but once he got to the top it hadn't been what he had expected. Right now, Quinn wanted to be by his side, helping him through what was going on. In his mind right now, Quinn was running through the options of what exactly was the best course of action. What to do next.

——

Standing on the sand, Vicky looked out at Sil, her head felt like it was spinning, her stomach churning. During this trip, she had conflicted feelings with herself, with what to do. In fact, for the first time since what felt like forever she and her twin brother had gotten into a serious argument.

Before the attack, Pai had stopped her, and suggested that perhaps they should just pretend they were aiding Hilston. If they were to meet Sil, her brother wanted them both to let him escape. Of course, Vicky had disagreed with this, stating that Hilston would find out and he would make them pay dearly for crossing him.

What they didn't expect was to meet Vorden and Raten in the bodies of humanoid beasts. Neither had they expected their supposed mother and father to run away, leaving them as the only ones in the real Blade family to follow Hilston's bidding.

'Everything that we did… everything that I did… for what? I destroyed that Shelter, killed all those people, because I thought it would please Hilston. I thought it would get me on his good side… Was it all for nothing?'

Images of the faces of the people who had begged her to let them live started to appear in her mind, followed by other horrible crimes she had committed. The girl felt like she was about to throw up.

That's when she felt Pai place his hand on her shoulder.

"You don't have to fake it anymore. You don't have to live a lie any longer. You know we're twins, right? I knew that everything you did was an act. Now we can finally be free, we can do whatever we want." Pai said, hugging his sister who began to cry. Tears were running down Vicky's cheek, but she wasn't really sure if she deserved to live after everything she had done.

Looking at Sil, she could see he was still standing out there on his own. Perhaps he was feeling something similar to how she felt now.

"Wait a second." Vicky mumbled, getting out of her brother's embrace herself as she realised something horrifying. "Fire, Lightning, Teleportation and Telekinesis make four abilities, so what was the fifth one?"

Vorden and Raten looked at each other, trying to think if they had seen Hilston use a fifth ability. The others didn't quite understand why it was a big deal. So what if he had access to one more ability?

However, the Blade twins knew that in such a fight to the death, it was impossible for Hilston to not use everything at his disposal. If he had refrained from using it, then it meant he had been unable to easy it earlier. While sorting through all the Chained' abilities that came with a condition attached, Vicky eventually arrived at the worst possible conclusion.

"SIL!" Vicky shouted at the top of her lungs. "HILSTON'S NOT DEAD YET! ONE OF THE CHAINED HAD THE ABILITY OF SECOND CHANCE! GET RID OF HIM NOW!!!!"

After destroying Hilston's heart, Sil had pulled his hand out of his body and had been in his own world, his gaze aimed at the ground. Without his heart, Sil had been convinced that it had been the end of their tormentor.

Just to be sure though, Sil's hands started to light up with lightning. Before coming here he had touched Grim, who had stayed behind, to obtain his ability. With no Demon tier armour, he was sure this would finish him.

Shocking the body on the ground, the lightning had hit nothing but sand, scorching it black. A few meters to the side, Hilston could be seen standing, his muscular body on show without a wound on it. Even his hands were attached to his body, albeit new ones, the old ones still lay on the battlefield inside a part of the Demon tier beast gear.

"I never thought that my own flesh and blood would dare to kill me! I had big plans for you Sil, big plans." Hilston repeated. "I told you that you will never beat me, even if your abilities are better than mine!"

Hilston fired out a lightning attack, yet Sil quickly countered with his own. However, when the two lightning bolts collided, the powers were equal. Despite Sil being able to access six abilities, their MC cells were just lower than the ones that Hilston had touched.

"I might not have the same strength as you or a body as good as yours, but it doesn't matter." Sil shouted, because it was at that moment, that blood was seen dripping from Hilston's neck and his head dropped down. Using his super speed Sil grabbed the head before it dropped to the ground.

"I don't know if you're still alive in there, but thank you for letting me kill you a second time. Maybe this will make me feel a little better." Sil said, as he smashed the head in the sand and stomped on it for good measure. The skull was smashed in seconds and the brain inside popped like a balloon.

This was the real end of Hilston Blade.

*******

# Chapter 1238 A little help
When Vicky had shouted out the ability name Second chance, Raten, Vorden and Sil had no clue what she was talking about. In the first place, they were the youngest members of the main Blade family, so they had yet to learn all the secrets like the others.

The original plan had been for Sil to return after two years of military service. Once he had gotten 'fixed' Hilston would have proceeded with whatever his plan had been. However, the plan needed adjustment, since there had been no improvement in Sil and then the start of the Civil war had messed things up even further.

However, given the name of the ability itself and the worry he had heard coming from Vicky's voice gave him enough of an idea about what the ability would be able to do. The user of that ability would be granted a second chance at life. It was an incredibly powerful ability that they had discovered, even with the drawback that it could only be used once every twenty four hours.

The reason why not everyone in the Blade family used this ability was not only because it would limit the number of abilities they could functionally use, but also due to the high amount of MC cells it required. In the Blade family's case, this was a good thing.

Alas, Hilston Blade had now been killed for a second time within this twenty four hour frame period and even without such a cooldown, Sil had made sure to destroy his brain this time. The headless body of the strongest human dropped to the floor, revealing Slicer.

Just like Graham, she could be counted as an outlier amongst the Dalki, so she didn't succumb to her urges of needing to kill a human. Instead, she was more true to her primal desire of wanting to evolve by fighting strong opponents.

She had been surprised to see that the person she fought for so long, had miraculously been able to revive, only for him to be killed by his killer for a second time. However, while her interest in Hilston had faded, with Sil demonstrating his strength, she couldn't help but want to fight him. For all Slicer knew, he could prove to be the final push she lacked to reach an even higher form.

The female Dalki went ahead and swung her colossal tail, attempting to cut the newcomer down. Reacting, Sil hardened his body, but his defense was ineffective. The tail continued to go through his arm that was even able to best the Demon tier armour.

'This hardening ability is supported by the MC cells of six people put together, yet it's still going through so easily!' Watching the fight, and being in the fight were two different things. Now Sil himself was experiencing the power of a five spike Dalki, who was on the verge of death but also her next evolution.

"Sil, use your lightning powers now!" Vicky shouted.

The voice was familiar, so Sil took their advice. However, there was nothing he could do about the arm, Slicer had claimed for her own. From the forearm onwards it had fallen to the ground, but with the other hand, Sil used his lightning ability.

"This tickles!" Slicer shouted. "The old man's power was the same."

Running through the sand were Pai and Vicky holding hands, and they too fired off their lightning abilities, hitting Slicer again, pushing her far back and away. That wasn't the only attack that hit her.

A blade made of mud attacked a wound on Slicer's left side, while another two balls of wind hit Slicer from the right. Raten, and Vorden had also left to join the fight.

"We have to help out!" Fex shouted, since the rest had stayed by the sand dune.

"No!" Sam shouted. "That five spike is too strong. Right now, all of them have run out because of their emotional attachment, not thinking things through. That Dalki may be on its last legs, but it also means it's at its strongest right now. I won't let all of you lose your lives!"

It was then they could see Slicer shouting in rage, and swinging her two tail whips around, cutting the lightning attacks, while also disrupting the mud blade and wind attacks.

"Alright, I'll kill you all then!" She shouted, but there was one more person who had yet to join in, appearing directly in front of Slicer who could see a fist in front of her face.

"Don't mess with my family!" Borden screamed, putting all his anger and strength into this punch. Seeing Sil's hand on the floor infuriated him, and more so than anyone he knew the strength of the Dalki firsthand.

When the punch landed, Slicer's face turned to the side for a second, and from the corner of her eye, she could see who, or what had just hit her.

"You're a Dalki, yet you dare lay your filthy hands on me!" Slicer shouted, swinging her colossal tail against him, but before it hit Borden, Sil grabbed him and moved him out of the way just in time.

——

Still, the sight of what had just happened had been seen by everyone who watched the livestream.

"That…was that a Dalki? Was it just me or did I see a Dalki go up against that five spiked one? Just what is going on?"

"I saw it too, it had scales and spikes and everything. It was a four spiked Dalki!"

"Why are the Dalki helping the Cursed faction?! See, I told you all that they really are working together! But why are they fighting against the five spiked Dalki? I'm so confused right now."

"Does it really matter what's going on? Maybe it's just an ability or something. As long as that five spike dies here, I'll support the Cursed faction. She has to be on her last legs and I don't care what happens but they just need to beat her!"

——

It was strange, Borden with his rising anger had managed to summon four spikes, and deliver a punch to the Slicer, but it had accomplished virtually nothing. It was the first time for his strength to be lacking. It was then that the realisation had set in, of what a mistake they all had made.

"Sil! You're fast right, we can't beat her! I thought maybe with all of us we could do something but we have to get out of here!"

Even with the rest of the Blade family present, they were all unsure if they could beat the Dalki in front of them.

——

Inside the command centre, Graham, watching everything, had a concerned look on his face, but when turning to look at Quinn, it had changed to a smile.

"It's brilliant, right? This strange man of the Blade family was not something that had been within our calculations. He proved to be far stronger than I could have ever expected. Perhaps he could have even been a hope to those humans. Yet, isn't it ironic that another human caused him to fall in battle?"

"Even in desperate times, humans are incapable of working together. Truly fascinating. If maybe all of these had helped, during the fight, Slicer would have been defeated, but now they have no one that can be a match against her." Graham stated with confidence.

Listening and watching the whole thing, Quinn found one thing weird, the look on his face just seconds ago. Something had to be up.

'Could it be that this female Dalki really is on her last legs?' Quinn wondered.

"I still don't know why you decided to betray us, but for you to not be the only one. It is something I will need to look into. And there is something that seems off about that four spiked Dalki. Perhaps I should ask Slicer to bring back its corpse once she is done with them." Graham walked up to the glass container staring at Quinn, he looked closer, as if he was expecting some type of reaction.

"The fight isn't over yet. They just need a little more help." Quinn said, as he closed his eyes.

Seconds later, and a beeping sound echoed throughout the room. Turning to his machine Graham could see that something had happened to his 'guest'. A moment later and a flatline was displayed.

'Did he just kill himself after saying those words?' Graham wondered about the strange behaviour. 'No, none of us should have the ability to just kill ourselves in such a fast manner either. The words were also too confident and he never kept his eyes off the screen. … It shouldn't be possible!'

'Slicer, she needs to get out of there NOW!'

———

Sam was worried about Sil and the others, and he could tell that Fex wanted to run out there and help, but the two of them wouldn't be able to do a single thing against the beast. It was then that Sam could see Quinn in front of them all.

Quinn was now standing opposite Slicer.

"Another insect has joined the battle!" She growled.

[Skill activated Nitro accelerate]

[Demon tier Amulet has finished transferring energy]

[Soul weapon activated Shadow Overload]

———

"Everyone, in another fascinating turn of events, the Cursed faction leader, Quinn Talen, has now joined the fight against the five spiked Dalki!" Bonny reported.

*******

# Chapter 1239 Defeat?
Watching the fight so far, Graham had actually been paying close attention to everything that had been going on. He had a keen eye, and despite only having briefly seen the faces of the people on the livestream once, he had remembered them all.

'That person, they called him the Cursed faction leader. I was told to keep an eye on him, I never knew he was on that planet.' Graham thought. 'Earlier when the camera panned, he was just off by the sides, so why now of all times? Is it because his people are in trouble? No, if that was the case then he could have jumped in when the first lot did.'

His mind started to go through all the possible calculations, and eventually he turned his head to the Dalki that was in his container, now having died. He went over to the computer to check back what had occured. That's when he could see that moments before the Dalki's death, its brain waves were changing, almost becoming non-existent. This had all happened before the Dalki had lost its life.

"The words spoken and the Cursed faction leader joining the fight, on top of the Dalki switching over sides, this can't all be coincidence. Slicer…I'm afraid you might be in real trouble.'

———

Watching the fight, through the screen, Quinn had been able to gather a few things. The five spiked Dalki's speed was great. Nearly on its last legs, it was even more powerful than anything he had encountered and there was one part of it that could move faster than any other, its tail.

If it wasn't for Hilston having his armour, or teleportation ability he would have been caught by it a lot earlier in the fight. Having drained the energy from his original body a while ago, Quinn wasn't sure how strong his body would be when he returned, but he made use of the amulet's ability to allow him to drain those he had Marked.

To his surprise, when doing so not only did he get the one spiked now two spiked Dalki energy back, but the energy he had transferred to the Dalki as well, so Quinn was not only back in top shape, but was even better.

The only thing was, after having suffered a defeat, he knew he couldn't hold back. The active skill on the armour set, was to give him full speed so now he was on a timer, as such he activated his soul weapon, giving him unlimited access and full control over the shadow.

'Still, this isn't enough, I lost to that five spike and I saw how much Hilston struggled to hurt it. I need something else.'

Although, Quinn's armour was a high tier one, it was not strong enough to block any attacks coming from that tail. Its sharpness had already been proven by its ability to even cut through the Demon tier Armour, but there was one thing that could work.

Shadows appeared over Quinn's hand, and now he was wielding a long Katana like blade.

"A sword?! What the hell is Quinn doing bringing out a sword in a time like this?! Quinn isn't a master swordsman like Leo, so why would he use that in a serious fight?!" Fex complained.

"Maybe it isn't Quinn, and it's the other person." Sam suggested, but even if it was the real Quinn, he knew he wouldn't pull out a sword for no reason at all.

Slicer had mostly disregarded Quinn up until now, instead focusing towards what she perceived to be the most troublesome one, the young blonde haired boy who had defeated Hilston. She swung her fast tail at him and Borden and Sil were unable to react to it.

Sil had super speed, but if he was to move out of the way, Borden would likely be killed, with the rest following right after. Still, his hardening wasn't strong enough to block the tail, and yet a clang was heard as the tail struck against something.

Quinn could be seen there with the sword in his hand, he had blocked the attack.

"Sil, I'm going to need your help, and the help of the rest of your family over there. Just concentrate on the strongest attack you can produce, and leave the defense to me!" Quinn shouted, releasing a large wave of Qi.

The tail was pushed back but only a little bit, and soon he was being overpowered.

'So I guess that answers that question, a five spike is stronger than me, even when I use all of my Qi. I guess I can only rely on my shadow.' Quinn thought as a shadow was being used to block the tail.

Of course, Slicer didn't stop there and started to move her colossal tail, attacking multiple places, yet the boosted Quinn was able to match that speed and stop it with the sword slightly, moving back using his shadow as well.

"How! How are you able to stop my attack!" Slicer shouted with anger.

With Quinn's soul weapon he didn't have a limit on how much shadow he could use, but the shadow was still slower than Slicer's primary tail. However, with Nitro acceleration he could match up in speed, and use the sword to block the attack.

As for the sword itself, Quinn never thought it would be used in a situation like so, but thanks to Longblade, he had been given the sword that seemed useless but had one trait, that it was unbreakable.

The extra speed, Qi, his vampire strength, and the energy his Demon tier Amulet had allowed him to drain, all factored into him gaining enough power to slightly push back against Slicer's tail.

"Everyone!" Quinn shouted, continuing to block each attack with his sword. Although the blade could be held with one hand, he was holding it with two due to the sheer strength behind each attack. The tail was keeping the two of them at a distance from each other so he was unable to touch her with his gauntlets to drain her either.

"We might only get one chance at this, so attack with everything you got. We need to kill her! Right now, all of our planets are under attack! They think they can just walk over us, well I won't let them!" Quinn shouted, as he held the sword with only one hand. His muscles bulged.

He didn't know how much longer he could continue to block the attacks this way or at all, but he had to do something. Multiple shadow portals started to appear around the area where Slicer was at. At the same time, without her knowledge, consumed by the rage of not being able to defeat the opponent in front of her, a shadow was covering the sand and had now reached underneath her feet as well.

'It looks like Hilston did a number on your wings and I have to thank him for that!'

Now with the shadow portals open, Quinn ran back out of range of the tail. He placed the sword away, and started to run forward. He didn't have much time, as the active skill was running out, but now he had to rely on his body to avoid all of the tail strikes. Moving left, right, piles of sand were chucked up and that's when Slicer noticed something.

'My attacks, they have slowed down!'

It was the effect of the shadow path she was standing on that had covered the wide area in shadow. With this, Quinn could avoid the attacks more easily under the effects of his boost. He soon threw his red blood disks out into two of the shadow portals by his side, while running forward, and they all started to appear from the shadows that were scattered around Slicer.

'Kill, I have to kill the Dalki! I have to get stronger, to beat him!' Was running through Quinn's head, and a mist started to appear from his back.

'I shall help you with your desire.' The voice said, as another portal appeared from behind. It was the Boneclaw which was as large as the Dalki itself. With its giant claws, it had pierced Slicer back. The almost impenetrable skin had been penetrated with ease. She screamed out in pain and swung her colossal tail, hoping to cut the Boneclaw, once hit it had turned back into the black mist and disappeared once more, but the familiar had already done a number on her.

It also gave Quinn enough time to sprint forward, and with his two blood drills he was ready. Now, standing behind the five spiked Dalki, Borden, Raten and Vorden were ready to follow up the Boneclaw's attack.

Quinn thrusted both blood drills directly into the five spiked Dalki's chest. The blood continued to spin in place, attempting to pierce the skin, but it seemed impossible. However, Slicer soon felt another force, pushing her from behind.

Borden, Raten and Sil used their strength at the same time, hitting the Dalki from all sides, to prevent her from flying away. Still, they were unable to peirce the body, but the Qi had done a lot of internal damage. Moving out of the way, Quinn's nitro accelerate time was up.

"It's up to you." Quinn said, keeping his shadow ready just in case. It was an emergency measure, so that Quinn would be able to temporarily put Slicer in the Shadow lock, and keep her there hopefully long enough for everyone else to escape.

When Quinn moved though, it was to allow one last attack to go through. A lightning attack that was being made, by now the combination of the strongest ability users in existence. Sil, Pai and Vicky, had jumped up, and started to spin their bodies as the three of them had turned their bodies into gigantic lightning bolts.

Due to the three of them being together, they were able to create one giant lightning bolt strike. Slicer was far more injured than she had perceived as she had never felt this way before.

'I have to…get away.' It was the first time her instincts told her to flee instead of continuing a fight. Alas, she could see nothing but a bright light in front of her. Skimming her hand over her chest, she felt that her scales had been damaged a little.

'That black haired person…is dangerous' Was her last thought, as she was struck by the lightning bolt that had passed right through her. Sil, Pai, and Vicky were seen on the other side. Looking back only to see half of Slicer's body completely missing.

———

"They did it, they did it! They defeated the five spiked Dalki!" Bonny announced it to the whole world.

At the same time, Quinn heard a familiar ding sound.
