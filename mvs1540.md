# Chapter 1540 - The Cursed Leaders Back Again

Although it had been a while since Nate had discovered the main Dalki base, he wasn't instructed to step on the planet on his own; instead, he was called to another planet to change the type of ship they would be using for this battle.

Instead of the small combat ship, they would use one of the medium-sized vessels deployed in this area from the main Cursed ship.

Currently, he was waiting patiently, having moved away from the main Dalki ship.

For one, he was worried that if he stayed around too long, the enemy might dispatch forces to attack him. A space fight wasn't exactly in his best interest, and the Dalki ships were just as good if not better than those that earth had, which was why Humans preferred combat on the planets rather than in space.

At the same time, a large uncrewed drone ship was monitoring the planet. It was also being used to get an energy reading from the planet. Because of this, it didn't matter if Nate let it out of his sight or not.

While waiting at the given coordinates, the new ship finally came into sight, and he couldn't help but stare at it with stars in his eyes.

"Whoa…that's what we will be using…it looks so cool." It was a medium-sized vessel for a crew of around twenty-five at most. However, it was nothing like he had seen in the military designs before.

The front nose of the ship was quite pointed, while the top had a large living area with two curved apertures that looked like wings. It looked like it had the momentum of a combat ship, yet clearly wasn't the size of one, and Nate was correct with his guess.

This ship was one that Logan had specially made. Whenever he would have free time, he was always trying to come up with new inventions, and he knew that a fast, agile ship that could carry the main bulk of the Cursed leaders would be needed one day, which was exactly what he had made.

"Nate, thank you for waiting; please approach the ship now." A familiar voice said.

Following the instructions, Nate moved in no time.

——

Nate noticed that the inside was just as impressive as the outside upon boarding the ship. It reminded him of the feeling the first time he had entered the Big Bertha, which was now the Cursed ship created by the military.

Only, the design in this place suited more modern attics. It was streamlined smooth; hardly any edges or wires could be seen. It almost didn't feel like he was in a ship at all. Heading towards the ship's bridge, he soon ran into Logan and Layla.

He had been informed a bit about the plan and the good news, but not all the fine details that would be explained after everyone arrived.

"I'm glad to see the both of you are okay…we had a tough time on our end," Nate said, but as soon as he spoke these words, he could see that Layla wasn't exactly in the best of shapes.

Her arm had been reattached relatively easily, but she touched it as soon as Nate said that and had brought upon a wave of crashing memories.

"I'm sure we will all want to share our experiences, but let's wait until the rest of us arrive. We will discuss the plans once everyone comes and talk to each other about our battles."

Now, it was a waiting game for the group, but it didn't take long for the other groups to arrive since they had been on standby, waiting for the following instructions. The first to arrive was Peter, and along with him was the sixth vampire leader Jake Muscat. Other than him, Peter had his lesser Wights, though only bringing three with him in total this time: Legs, Headless Hilston and the Humanoid Dalki with the long claw-like hands.

Judging from the looks on everyone's faces, they were pretty surprised that Peter could use one of the Humanoid Dalki.

As Logan suggested, they kept the questions to themselves, for now, waiting for the others to arrive as well. The next group that was to reach was Linda and Fex, and lastly, the whole of the Blade family came. Vorden, Raten, Sil and Borden had all come together.

All of them were seated around a round table, where as usual, Logan would display a holographic screen talking about the plan before the group got into action.

"So the latest readings claim two things. First, the current force on the Main Dalki base planet is no more than the other forces we have fought against. Now, this doesn't mean it would a hundred per cent be the case; after all, there might be places that the device had missed, or perhaps the enemy has a way of creating more Dalki like the ones we have all faced - the new Gen Dalki.

"However, I would guess that it's unlikely. From my discussions with Sam...they probably didn't think we would get this far. But thanks to our power increase in addition to the vampires, most battles that we would have fought and lost had the opposite outcome. Also, using the demon tier device, we can confirm that the demon tier beast is still present as well.

"Our ship has a camouflage ability, making it nearly invisible and silent. It will take some time for us to land as the momentum is drastically decreased, but after that, the crystals will continue to power the ship's camouflage while we will head to the location of the demon tier beast's reading."

"This should be easy for us then," Peter said with his arms crossed. "We took out our enemy easily, and now it looks like the Cursed faction is back together again. Even if your little reader thing is half wrong, I think we can still deal with whatever is coming our way."

The others seemed to agree, at least the ones that had an easier time defeating the enemy.

"We haven't talked about it much, but on our planet, there was a five spike Humanoid Dalki," Layla mentioned. "I heard the rest of you went up against four spikes…there's a big difference in their power, and it might be the reason that Graham chose to freely leave this place instead of protecting the Demon tier beast."

"A five spike!?" Fex replied in shock. They had gotten the report of their success but not the details of what had happened. "We had a lot of trouble just against One Horn...I can't imagine."

"Well, this time, you have the Blades and us," Peter replied. "I know you guys struggled, and we struggled before too, but it won't be the same as before, and besides, Layla and the others somehow managed to defeat it, which means we can do the same. Right, Layla?"

When asking this question, Layla was a little silent. She didn't want to admit that their whole group actually had no chance against Helen Dalki, not yet anyway. She did imagine how the others would have faired, though.

"Well, just in case. I have some of the blood of One Horn with us, and it will give Jake and me a boost in strength before the fight." Fex explained. "The others, are they all returning to their bases and to the vampire shelter?"

"Yes," Logan replied. "Sam, the vampires, vampire leaders and the others that have helped so far will be returning to their Shelter. The news about Sunny, Nicu and the other leaders who have sacrificed themselves in this war isn't disclosed yet.

"As for Owen and Samantha, although they had victories, their forces won't be of any help anymore. They would just be dead weight or used as human meat shields if they joined the fight now. They are currently focused on recovering their strength and protecting their planets. To put it simply, they are out of this war, and they can no longer fight."

Listening to this, everyone knew that now, it was up to the vampire leaders and the Cursed faction to finish this war. One was going to defend against the final attack from the Dalki, while the other was going to give a final blow to the Dalki's on their main base.

Since the destination was set and it was time for them to head to the main Dalki base, everyone started to talk about the battles they had faced and shared their insights, thoughts and experiences. They discussed the sacrifice of the people they had lost so far, but there were two main things that others were paying attention to.

One of them was the fact that Erin had killed Nicu. Nate felt like everyone should know about this, especially the vampire settlement, and it was something he couldn't keep in anymore. The others, of course, believed what Nate was saying, and they now knew that if they were to come across her, they would be cautious.

On the other hand, Layla still hadn't talked about her own experience and instead let Logan tell the event's details. Too many unbelievable things seemed to be going on in the war, but at least they understood their position.

"So what about Quinn?" Vorden eventually asked. "I feel like...whether Graham fights us here or is at the vampire settlement, only he can go against him. What's he currently doing?"

# Chapter 1541 - Peaceful Dalki

The new ship travelled faster than the usual medium-sized vessels, which meant they wasted next to no time getting to the Dalki main ship's location, the place which their enemy called home. Looking out the window, they could see it did really look like a small planet.

What was most interesting about it wasn't just the shape of the thing, but the fact that it was made up of several different terrains. It was a spaceship that the Dalki had made using all of the other beast planets.

"When I look at this, I feel a bit sad for the Dalki," Logan said as they slowed down upon approaching the place. They turned the ship's camouflage system on as they slowly came to the planet, lowering the probability of alerting the enemy.

Logan had backed every bit of his family's technology and his own knowledge, including Richard's, to create this ship. After completing the trials, everyone was left with a weapon to help them in this battle.

Although it might have seemed like the reward was the Nest Crystal, to Logan, he felt more like it was the knowledge left behind by Richard for someone to take his place in all of this.

"What do you mean? The Dalki are trying to kill us; why would you feel sad for them?" Fex asked. "No offence Borden." He felt like he needed to mention since Borden was also a Dalki.

"Just think about it, can't you? The Dalki were created by vampires, but that place never felt like home to them. Earth is a place they hadn't been to before, so what did they do? Looking at this, it feels almost as if they tried to create their own home."

"That still doesn't change the fact that they are trying to kill us, again, no offence Borden," Fex added once again.

"It makes me wonder, why doesn't Borden want to kill us?" Vorden asked. "I mean, he's just like the Dalki and the humanoid Dalki that we have encountered."

Borden placed his finger on his chin as he thought about the answer himself.

"I don't even know the answer to that one." He finally replied. "When I first was born, I just wanted to find you, brother, but I do have an urge to keep fighting, but that goes for all creatures, not just humans. Still, I can suppress it."

"It was my first time." Logan suddenly said, which made the others strangely look at Logan, waiting for him to explain himself. "I think Borden mixing in with so little of the beast DNA compensated for using most of your structure Vorden…or Sil's structure, to be precise. Honestly, there are some things that even I can't explain with science.

"For instance, at the time, the mind that was occupying Sil's body was yours, Vorden, and the personality that Borden represents most out of all three of you is yours. In fact, I can say that he nearly doesn't have a trace of the other two.

"Yet, the body always had and always belonged to Sil? Honestly, it might just be that Vorden's nature is so good that it overcomes any Dalki desires, or just like any creation, when mixing a set of genes together and mashing things up, no person or Dalki, I should say in this instance, is the same. Let's think of Borden as a mutation. In fact, if we could study Borden more, we could try to find out what makes him different from the rest.

"When we know this factor, we could try changing the Dalki. However, to even try to do something like that, even if we did find a solution, we would have to capture them and modify them. Imagine trying to do that when we are already fighting for our lives." Logan explained

"Speaking of which," Little Borden said. "I only have one injection left. I know you made a lot for me when we had the Demon tier beast, but I was wondering if you had any more."

"Unfortunately, that is the last one. The demon tier beast that Quinn has can not be used anymore. Perhaps if we are successful in our goal or find something in their lab, we can do something."

The ship was ready to land in a forest-like region as the conversation ended. It looked for the most open area and scanned for any traces of life, but there weren't any signs of life on this side of the planet. After crushing a few trees, the ship landed, and everyone descended from the ship.

Looking back, they could see that the ship was practically invisible; it was amazing, and with the trees, it was nearly impossible to find it. Although one could still touch it, and if touched, a ripple around the ship would reveal its location.

"Don't worry; the ship is linked to inform me if it reads any signs of life coming within its range," Logan explained. "However, we have a long walk in front of us. All of the Dalki, just like the forces before, are focused on one location."

"I think it might have been that large black tower. I mean, that has to be a dead give-away that something is there, right?" Fex commented.

The rest nodded at this, and soon, it was time for them all to make their way over there. The group walked through the forest-like territory for a while, and up ahead, they noticed the surface changing into a strange hard black substance ground.

"Before we engage in combat, I would like to ask everyone a favour." Logan started to speak, following something on his wristwatch. He was seemingly looking at something, but the others couldn't really see.

"The Dalki have a lab here, and I would like to gather as much information from them as possible. So let's try to get all the Dalki out of the area. Deal with the Dalki first, and then try to handle the Demon tier beast. In fact, if we deal with all the Dalki here, then maybe we can just leave the Demon tier beast captive. They are sure to have it locked up somewhere." Logan asked.

"Why would you want to get information from the Dalki? We will be getting rid of them all away." Jake said and then received a look from small Borden, who was riding on Vorden's shoulder. "Sorry little guy, I keep forgetting."

"Destroying knowledge is something we must not do because it can help us in the future; besides, you guys keep talking about how strong you were. If it's true, then these forces should be easy for you."

"Haha, that sounds great!" Raten stated, punching his fists together. "Alright, then why don't we all have a friendly competition? Who can deal with the most Dalki while on here? I mean, I would win anyway, but maybe I should use one hand to give you guys an advantage."

Usually, the others weren't so much into competitions, especially with how serious the situation was, but Raten always managed to annoy them somehow.

"Are you so sure about that Raten? Is Sil included in this as well?" Vorden asked.

"Haha...I have a big advantage if that's the case." Peter said with his lesser Wights walking by his side.

"What is wrong with you guys!" Layla suddenly spoke up. Linda had been quiet all along as well. She was still affected by what happened in battle with One Horn, but she knew this conversation was just a way how the others were dealing with the pressure of the situation. For Layla, it was different.

"This is dangerous; we could all die, people are dying now, and there are even those attacking the Vampire settlement. Once they're done there, they will go for the other planets, and here you are taking all this as a game."

There was silence from most of them until Peter broke the ice.

"Calm down, are you on your period or something?" Peter replied. "Just because we know your weak arse isn't going to win, no need to complain about our fun. Stop spoiling it for us…."

At that moment, Peter's voice trailed off, and everyone paused and glanced at each other, because coming out from behind a rock…was Dalki.

*****

# Chapter 1542 - Creating A Big Bang

The reason why most of them had glanced at each other was that they thought that seeing the first Dalki was the sign for their little competition to start. They all looked at the Dalki like it was some prey, and at the same time, when it saw them, it opened its mouth wide, as if it was ready to attack.

The Dalki aren't the type of beings to run away in the first place, and it wasn't as if they knew or bothered learning the faces of the humans that they needed to be scared of.

"The first one's mine!" Peter shouted, almost charging forward but before anyone else had moved. There was already someone faster than him and had punched Dalki in the chest. The fist pushed through the Dalki's chest, and it died without knowing what had hit him.

"So you decided to go for a speed ability once again?" Fex questioned. "Damn, I really thought that you might have picked stronger abilities in case you went up against Graham. Since you know they didn't work last time, why didn't you pick some other abilities?"

"This ability…saves lives," Sil replied and went back to walk with the rest. "Also, that's one point to me."

Honestly, Fex was just complaining because he knew with all of these monsters in this group, he stood next to no chance of ever winning the competition. He just wasn't even in the same league, even though they would often call him on these events because he knew the Cursed people well, and his strong ability came in handy a lot.

It made him think if his ability was something else, would they even consider inviting him along? Still, Sil did think Fex had a point because it wasn't enough to beat Graham if they ran into him with the current set of abilities.

"The competition is a good idea. My abilities won't last for a long time, so we should get a move on." Sil reminded them.

"Agreed," Logan said. "Since we have already encountered the first Dalki, we must be close to the main base."

The group was treading lightly with their destination, the huge black tower, now in reach. Nate didn't know how to use Shadow travel, but he succeeded in spreading out his shadow on the ground, making their footsteps almost silent as they continued to walk.

Once again, the terrain changed, and now it looks more like a jungle. The ground was still black underneath, but there were plenty of trees, which was perfect for the group to conceal themselves. The others had spotted a few more Dalki, but raising his hand, Logan stopped others from going after them, at least until they were aware of the whole situation.

"I can hear something. It sounds like a ship's engine." Jake said.

Trusting the vampire's leader's ears, they decided to follow the direction of the sound and soon reached what looked like a launching pad, but not just any type; it was one where all the Dalki motherships that they had seen were.

There were several ships here, around four of them landed at present, and the sound of other Dalki making more, but not just Dalki, they also noticed the presence of vampires, and surprisingly, all of them looked the same.

"What the f*ck!" Nate almost shouted, but it just turned into a loud whisper. "That's Jim! That's all those clones from that island, do you remember? Come on, you guys, you have to remember."

The others knew all right.

"Just because the original might be dead doesn't mean they can't stop creating clones," Logan said.

"Wait a minute, why can't they clone Dalki then? Like they do the vampires. Can't they use those new nest crystals you found?" Nate asked.

Logan shook his head.

"I think it's something to do with a demon tier beast's energy. In the first place, a nest crystal can't produce a demon tier beast, and how they actually exist is something unknown. Perhaps a beast keeps evolving? An unnatural occurrence, but the beast made by a nest crystal is never that powerful to start with.

"Since the Dalki have the Demon tier energy in them, it's impossible to replicate. Anyway, speaking of the Demon tier beast, the reading seems to be coming from behind them, and if I am not wrong, the structure which I am sure we can all see is the lab we were discussing earlier."

Indeed, the others noticed the lab too; it wasn't too far away.

"The other reading, although there are a lot of Dalki here, most of the energy sources are coming from closer to where that tower is," Logan explained.

The tower wasn't too far off from where they were, and they could see it too, but it was perhaps a kilometre over in the other direction. Now the question was, what was the group to do.

"I have an idea. I know before we left the ship, we agreed it wasn't a good idea for us to split up." Logan said. "But in this case, it might be. You guys still want to have your competition, right? Then my suggestion is that the Blades, along with Nate and Fex, except for Borden, head towards the tower.

"He comes with us, and Linda and Layla will stay with me. You guys, I want you to make as big a bang as possible, and if there is any trouble at all, notify us immediately. If you can handle it, then go crazy. If you can't, we will come up with another plan.

"Honestly, if you guys can't handle it, I doubt we would be able to as well, which is why we need another plan to get rid of the Demon tier beast. The other group will head inside the lab." While saying this, he gave little Borden a wink.

There was another reason he wanted to head there inside with Borden.

To see if there was anything they could do about his state. According to Quinn, he had seen the technology they had, and if Jin's clone was still here, he felt confident he would find something that would help little Borden no longer be little anymore.

The others seemed to agree somewhat, apart from Fex, who wanted to go along with the girls, but both groups were already moving their own ways, leaving Fex just to shake his head.

'I wish I was with Samantha…anyway, I just need to get through this, and then I can spend the rest of my time with her.'

——

It didn't take long for Nate and the others to reach the front of the black tower, but they noticed something strange. While making their way there, they noticed that in front of the base was the ground caved inward, and there were several cracks in it as well. Eventually, they realised it wasn't natural for the land to be that way; what they were in was an enormous crater.

At first, they thought it was just part of the land layout, but now that they were by the edge that only just reached the black tower, they could tell it was a crater.

"Is that just me, or does that look like someone bombed the ground, or maybe...punched it?" Nate asked.

It certainly looked to be the case.

"Does that mean…whatever created that is here?" Fex asked.

Running out, Sil was first. He stood there, and a group of Dalki guarding outside the strange tower had spotted him.

"Either way…we will have to face whatever created that crater if they are here or not. We have to try and stop him. We can't just rely on Quinn all the time." Sil said as he picked up a stone and threw it towards the Dalki. The stone went through the Dalki's head in the next moment, killing it instantly.

The others redied themself as it sounded like more were soon coming.

———

Back where Logan and the others were, they were patiently waiting a few seconds later, and they could hear constant explosions go off in the distance, not too far away. The Dalki and the clones, noticing this, started to rush over while a few had stayed behind.

"Looks like they are causing quite the commotion over there. Let's go." Logan said.

*****

# Chapter 1543 - Inside The Dalki Base

Around Logan's left arm, there was a constant robotic casing. For the most part, this was because he covered up what his Dalki arm looked like. It didn't look too out of place for Logan because his whole suit was made up of strange nanomachinery, which he could break down to create different suits or use for unique circumstances like the current one.

The good thing was, Logan always had a set of supplies with him, and he had somewhat predicted that there would be vampires at the Dalki main base. One of his guesses was that Jim would be here, though he wasn't considering encountering this many.

Still, because of this, he had prepared a special spray with him that allowed him to blend in with other vampires. They would be picking up his special scent, and thus, he also sprayed it on Borden and Layla for safe measure. Subclasses carried a different and detectable scent, and as for Borden, Logan honestly had no idea, but there was no need to take risks.

They were using the special spiders, and thanks to the big distraction in the opposite direction, they managed to reach the special lab without any trouble. They had the perfect team with them. The spiders could spot hallways and more, alerting them if anyone came their way.

As for Little Borden, at a glance, most would choose to ignore him, so help the team get through small places, then there was Layla. Currently, the group had made it into the main lab and the locked doors weren't a problem for Logan with his powers. The only one who felt somewhat useless was Linda, but she was ready to help whenever needed.

"We need to get to this lab's server room or something similar. Although it might not have the information we need, it should have the layout of this place." Logan explained.

His spiders were busy searching the place, and they could see two Dalki coming their way down one of the hallways. They were in somewhat of a rush. Rising her hand, Layla started to float up a few rocks she had picked up from the outside.

She slowly moved it past their feet on the ground and then flung it as fast as she could, hitting the wall of that hallway in the opposite direction.

"Did you hear that… let's go; we need to check it out. I heard the attackers are humans, but there are only a few of them; there could be more!" The Dalki said as they rushed over.

Logan realised on this mission that the Dalki weren't exactly the brightest, and as they went around the place, they also noticed that all the vampire clones were being treated like slaves.

They were being pushed around without any regard and respect and were silenced whenever they tried to say anything. How the situation came to be would certainly be an interesting one, but first, Logan had another job to finish.

Heading into one of the rooms by the hallway, the team found themselves in some type of storage room. It had a mixture of chemicals in glass bottles, melted crystals and more.

'Judging by this, we should be close. Instead of walking around and getting caught, I should wait for my spiders to do the job. We are in a good enough location right now.'

Thinking about this, Logan began to guide the spiders to start the search, and it didn't take long for Logan to find what he was looking for. It wasn't the lab but a server room. That place might give them some basic information about where the Dragon and Graham's lab was.

"How are my brothers and the others doing?" Borden asked.

"They don't seem to be in trouble. I haven't gotten an update from them, but they said they would contact me only if there was some trouble. I am more concerned about trying to pinpoint the location of the Demon tier beast.

"The device that we were using before is getting readings from all over the place. My guess is they are using the Demon tier energy for several things, which is messing with the readings." Logan replied.

Using the same tactic that they had done before, they made their way to the server room. It was almost left unguarded, and honestly, Logan was quite surprised how few Dalki there were in the whole lab.

'Have they already consumed all of the beast's energy, or perhaps was Sam right in thinking that Graham is overconfident?'

Placing his hand on the server, Logan was ready to get whatever information he needed. As expected, the servers linked to the Demon tier beast weren't here and the same for Graham's lab, but it did reveal their location.

Unfortunately, the two of them were in opposite places in the lab. With the main centre in the way, they will have to decide which one to go to first. While looking through the server information, although it said nothing about the demon tier beast or Graham's research, it did have some other information.

'A breakout?' Logan thought. Looking into it a bit more, he had just uncovered some shocking information. 'It said here that there was an ability user here, who, along with Truedream, had escaped from this place!

'So Truedream really was alive after all...and he even managed to escape. Well, the Dalki are a bigger problem right now. It seems he's been gone for a while and hasn't done anything. Perhaps he is planning to stay out of this war?'

Glancing at Layla and then at Borden, Logan finally made a choice. For now, they would head to Graham's lab. He was still unsure what they would do with the Demon tier beast, and it might take a lot of time to defeat it anyway.

In the meantime, Logan wanted to see if he could do anything for Little Borden. The group rushed, following Logan, but he didn't say anything. This was the choice he had made. Eventually, they reached the lab and for once, came across another pair of guards. The pair stood firmly in front of the lab, and it didn't look like they could be distracted just with some noise, unlike the previous ones.

"They're both three spike Dalki…I won't be able to take them out without making some noise. Borden, if you used your injection and turned into a four spike, do you think you can beat them up quickly?" Logan asked.

Borden thought about it for a while. A four spike's strength was far greater than a three spike, but to defeat the enemy without making noise was a big concern.

"Hey," Layla called out. "I can do it."

It didn't cross Logan's mind to ask Layla. Because even though she had defeated the Dalki Helen, everything he had noticed about her seemed odd.

"Layla, I know what Peter said might have annoyed you, but it's too risky," Linda replied.

Logan looked at what was in Layla's hand. She was already holding the black sword by her side rather than the bow. Logan wondered since when did she start using this weapon.

"If you are sure you can do this, then go for it. Anyway, I don't think you would say anything if you didn't feel confident." Logan answered.

Nodding her head, Layla soon changed to her second form. She grew slighter taller, and the Horns on her head ported the most when she was in this form. Still, other than the fourth form, this was when she was at her fastest and had abilities more like that of a vampire, but the most noticeable thing was the flickering sword marking, pulsing like a heartbeat.

Layla squinted as she tried to ignore all the cries that went off in her head, and in the next second, she ran out. Her eyes had barely opened, but before the Dalki could even notice, her sword had already moved and sliced through the pair's necks, killing them on the spot.

The others, witnessing this, were speechless.

"Wow…maybe she should have joined the competition after all."

Borden smiled, but they suddenly saw Layla collapsing on the ground, right in front of the lab door.

*****

# Chapter 1544 - Getting An Upgrade!

The group outside in front of the large black tower didn't panic as they faced the Dalki. It looked like Logan's reading device was working correctly after all since there were around the same number of three to four spike Dalki that were at the other fortresses so far.

However, with the team, which consisted of many of the Cursed strongest, it was proving to be very little trouble. It was strange; never in their life would they think they would feel this way when fighting against the Dalki, treating it as some sort of competition.

Vorden was able to fly up high and slash out wind attacks from above, and then when needed, he would swoop down with his steel wings, dealing fatal blows to the enemy. Some Dalki even attempted to jump and latch onto him, but his clawed like feet were deathly strong and sharp.

If he managed to get a grip of any Dalki, they would find it near impossible to break free, not unless they wanted to kill the beast. After obtaining the crystals the vampires had kept, Vorden had used those crystals to evolve himself into a demon tier beast just like Raten.

His speed was deadly when he flew in a straight path using his wings. His wind powers were just as strong as a high-level wind ability user, and his body was just as strong as the Dalki he was facing.

At the same time, another Demon tier beast was causing a rampage, having created several sharp blades. Raten's strange mud-like substance also slowed down his opponents somewhat. Then calmingly walking on the ground, he would slice his enemies as if they were standing still.

Fex, who was down below, couldn't quite believe it. It was clear that Demon tier beasts were always a bigger worry than the Dalki. However, they never tried to take over earth, and the beasts didn't fight as a group. If two demon tier beasts found each other in the same territory, they would attempt to take each other out. It was something built-in to their nature.

'Man, if the humans ever had to go up against an army of demon tiers…that would be troubling.' Fex thought while standing at the back, with his hands by his side, not taking part in the battle. This was not because he didn't want to join and help; rather, it was just that there really was no reason for him to join.

Even Nate, who Fex always saw as someone below him, was doing fairly well due to the Demon tier shield he still had in his hand. Blocking hits left and right and blasting the Dalki away with twice the counter-power was sure to finish off nearly any of them.

Nate could also utilise it well since he could punch the shield himself to give it a blast of power here and there. The only problem with that was the power range coming from the shield.

Finally, there then was Sil, the one who, as expected, was performing the best among all of them. It was strange, but all Sil had been doing so far was picking up rocks from the ground and throwing them at the enemy. At times the force would be so strong that it would break before reaching its target.

Thankfully, Sil could use plenty of materials on the Dalki planet that withstood his throwing power, but each one that hit the Dalki pierced right through their body. If it hit the head or the heart area, the Dalki would die on the spot, as if a bullet went through them.

It was hard to tell whether this was a strength ability or something else, but Sil seemed very focused on his attacks.

In the tower itself, more Dalki were rushing down going towards the human's, but even they could see that what was currently going on was a slaughter fest. One of Jim's clones was also taking a peek out of the window inside the room.

"Two beasts, humans, vampires… It feels like everyone is going up against the Dalki. I guess Graham underestimated them after all." Jim said

"What do we do?" Another Dalki asked. It was a four spike whom Graham had left in charge in his absence, "We can't get in touch with Graham at the moment either. Something is jamming our devices!"

'So it looks like a great mind is here as well.' The clone thought.

"I have a suggestion. It's up to you whether you follow it or not, but if you choose not to, there's a good chance that all of us will die." Jim's clone smiled, thinking perhaps it could use this situation to his advantage.

———

Over in front of what the others believed to be Graham's lab, Layla had just collapsed. Immediately, the group rushed over, but it looked like she was still conscious. The first thing Linda did was lift her and place her on her back.

Then, she and Borden quickly moved the Dalki inside the lab while shutting the doors behind them.

"I'm okay, Linda. You can put me down…it's just a minor headache, that's all." Layla replied.

"I think it would be best that you don't use that sword too much if that's the drawback of using it. There are other ways we can deal with the Dalki." Logan said, but he wasn't looking at them. Instead, he looked out towards the lab and was surprised at what he could see.

There were large glass containers filled with liquid and more however that wasn't the surprising thing. All of the servers and other devices were smashed and destroyed.

"Why would he destroy his own lab and leave it like this?" Linda asked.

Seeing it, Logan could only laugh.

"It seems like he somewhat expected us to get this far and wanted to keep the information. Maybe, the old me would have been devastated to see this, but just hitting on these machines wouldn't stop me from extracting any information at all. That Dalki doesn't know who I am."

Placing his hand on the ground, Logan activated his soul weapon. Because of the information he had gathered before from the other server room, he knew the details of just what terminals were in this place and other necessary things. It was also all based on things he had seen upon getting information from Richard.

It looked like a lot of what Jim, Graham and Richard knew was most likely the same thing. Because of this, Logan could rebuild the entire room with his soul weapon. He broke down the machinery into finer, smaller spiders and began to restructure it again.

His skill wasn't like healing or reversing time; he was just fixing things and putting it back together. This was why when everything was complete, it was as if no one ever destroyed it in the first place.

"There might be some corrupted data here and there, but I think I'll manage." Logan smiled, placing his hand on the terminals and trying to uncover whatever he could.

The information was soon downloaded into his head. Now he was getting information on experiments that Graham had done so far, including about the humanoid beasts he had created.

The layout of this base showed that this place was linked to the Demon tier beast on the other side. Finally, after he downloaded everything, Logan had finished his work in this lab.

"Hahaha, the Dalki are searching for a way to get the ability to reproduce and live a long life. I now have all the information they want." Logan smiled. "Which means Borden...it's time for an upgrade. Hurry up! Hop into the glass container!

"It will take a long time to build a lab like this anywhere else. So, this is currently our best shot."

Borden didn't know what was happening but had trusted Logan before and would trust him now. A strange claw-like device came and picked up Borden, placing him in the glass container. Logan then turned it on, and the upgraded process would soon begin.

"How long is this going to take?" Linda asked.

"I'm not sure, perhaps an hour or so? Once Layla has recovered, I was going to tell you to look after this room. With what's happening outside, I doubt anyone would come in here while Layla and I go and check up on the Demon tier beast." Logan explained.

Layla was still a bit dizzy, but she was recovering very fast, so they should be able to move out soon.

Logan didn't tell them that he had found out something dire while going through the information in Graham's lab. The vampire settlement was in serious trouble, and he knew why Graham was so confident now.

# Chapter 1545 - Everyone Die

The group outside the black tower were doing very well in dealing with the Dalki. Still, even though this was the case, a thought flashed through Fex's mind as he watched everything.

'If I remember correctly, Logan said that the energy reading from this place was the same as the other places.' Fex thought. 'Yet so far, it appears that they are weaker than the other forces we have faced before. Which means that there should still be a humanoid Dalki.'

The battlefield was starting to get quiet as the number of enemies rushing out of the tower had lowered considerably. The dead bodies of the Dalki had piled up around the area, and the boys had ended their competition long ago.

The main reason was that there was already a clear winner among them all: Sil. Even though he didn't get directly involved much in the battle, but some time ago, he found a hard large rock-like substance not too far away, which he smashed with his bare fists, creating several smaller rocks for him to use, and throwing them, he dealt with the Dalki as soon as the latter stepped out of the tower.

"This is a bit unfair," Raten complained. "Sil had killed some of those that were stuck in my mud. As I contributed somewhat, I'm sure that should count as a half a point for me."

The next second, Vorden had landed right by Raten's side, who had somewhat stopped fighting as well. "I didn't expect you to be such a whining loser. Anyway, it's fine; it's a good thing that none of us was badly hurt in the first place."

Surprisingly, there was someone else too, who hadn't fought much and that was Peter; instead, he was busy walking through the battlefield, looking at all the Dalki that had been killed so far.

"All of these guys are useless!" Peter shouted, kicking one of the Dalki's bodies so hard it went flying off in the distance, "If Sil can kill them with a rock, then that means a five spike or more would be able to beat them. You would think that at their base, they would have something worth fighting!"

It was at that moment, at the very top of the shelter, a large object crashed out from the top. Parts of the tower began to fall, and the group quickly regathered themselves. They were in the crater, and the object that had landed in front of them was around ten metres away.

It looked like an uneven ball of a black mass as big as a van. Upon careful observation, they noticed it move slightly, and along its back, five spikes slowly protruded out.

Slowly breaking out of the strange ball, a large Dalki stood straight. Its forearms, shoulders and legs were twice the thickness of a regular Dalki.

"That doesn't look like a regular Dalki," Fex noted, which was obvious to all of them.

The Dalki itself was far broader, and its body structure was different in every way. It looked like a Dalki covered in thick armour that was two sizes too large for itself. The only thing was it wasn't armoured; they were just the scales of its body.

"This doesn't look like a humanoid Dalki," Vorden said. "Which means it's a regular five spike."

Hearing this, Peter just smiled because it was precisely what he was looking for.

Sil threw a stone from his hands towards the Dalki's chest like he had done on many others. It was fast and hit it perfectly, only to get crushed into pieces upon impact and not even making the Dalki flinch, much less force him back.

"This is what we needed. Last time, Slicer was too much for us; we needed the help of the other Blades and Quinn. This time, we have to show that we are strong enough to take out a five spike on our own!" Sil said.

The others were inclined to agree, ready for a fight.

———

Meanwhile, on the other side, before heading off to the Demon beast's location, Logan decided to inform Sam of what he had found out in Graham's lab.

"We are still making our way to the Settlement now. All of the leaders are there…but if what you say is true, even with us arriving, it still won't be enough. Although, I just checked the energy reading, and your worst-case scenario has yet to arrive." Sam replied, "For now, continue with the current plan. If the energy readings change, I will let you know."

Still, there was a considerable worry in Logan's mind. The only good thing was that they had their portable teleporter they could use, but Logan had created a wide range jammer for all teleporters so that the Dalki also couldn't suddenly appear here for backup.

Before they used the portable teleporter, they would have to finish their job here to head to the Daisy faction. Although they could go to the other battlefield once they finished their mission here, the question was, would they even be in the condition to fight?

'There are multiple options. Killing the Dragon will force it to go to its other half, which is currently in Quinn's shadow space, making it whole again. If that's the case, then there is a high chance it will wake up.

'But who knows how long that process will take. And whether or not the Dragon will go on a rampage is a different thing. We could stay here and protect the demon tier dragon until the battle is over, but others will most likely need our help.

For now, they needed more information, and because of that, Logan and Layla were heading to the other side of the lab, where Graham had held the Demon tier beast.

While walking through the lab, Layla and Logan noticed fewer workers around the place. Even Logan's spiders were unable to pick up anyone.

'The others must be doing an outstanding job.' Logan thought.

"We might have to fight the demon tier beast, right? It was already in a weakened state from the fight on Blade island, and now most of its energy is drained, so it should be at its weakest." Layla mentioned and no longer held the sword in her hand, but it was still by her side at all times.

"Yes, correct. However, remember that the Demon tier beast is still a Demon tier beast. We always were taught that the Humanoid Demon tiers were the strongest, but from what we have learned, we know that this Dragon is an exception to the rule. I'm just hoping that we can find a way where we won't have to have a direct confrontation with it." Logan replied.

As they got closer and closer to the other part of the lab, Logan noticed something from his spiders. The room where the Demon tier beast was held...was already open. So far, every room they had come across was securely shut by the Dalki, and this one should have been, but to their shock, it was open - it meant only one thing - someone had opened the gate and could be inside the room!

"We have to hurry!" Logan shouted, running forward, worried about what was about to happen.

Based on what his spiders were showing him, he recalled all of them to himself. The remarkable part of his suit was that it would break down when releasing the spiders.

"What's wrong? What did you see? " Layla asked.

"Get ready to fight; we have to stop them!" Logan shouted.

The door was up ahead, and they knew immediately they were in the right room. Upon reaching it they could see a giant rectangle container that held the Dragon in place. Countless large machines were injected into the Dragon, keeping it in a strange sedated state while continuously draining its energy.

Seeing the Dragon once again was a reminder of how fierce it was, and what frightened Layla most was that its eye was open, staring towards them.

"Layla, stop them!" Logan shouted.

On one side of the container, besides the control panel, was one of the Jim clones and two Dalki.

"Too late! If we are going to die anyway…why don't we all die together!'" Jim said, smashing down on one of the buttons, and soon all the strange machines linked to the Dragon began to come off one by one.

*****

# Chapter 1546 - The Strongest In The Group?




Soon after throwing the rock, Sil went in to perform his next move. He ran across the field, and when he got close, he switched from his speed ability to his strengthening ability. Since he could not reach Dalki's head, the only thing he could do was slam his fist into its stomach in front of him.

A loud bang resounded in the area and even blew the hair of the others a little. However, the Dalki didn't even flinch from where it was; instead, it stared down at Sil.

"I'm starting to wonder why the others were so scared of you," The five spike Dalki said as it lifted its hand and threw a punch at Sil, but with just a slight movement, Sil was able to avoid it with ease, and now that Dalki's head was a bit lowered, Sil moved again and whacked on its head.

This time, the head flung to the side a little, but turning back, the Dalki just smiled, and anticipating what it was going to do next, Sil took a few steps back.

'I knew that a five spike Dalki's scales were tougher than the four spikes but to this degree?' Vorden frowned while watching the fight. He and the others weren't nervous even though there was a five spike.

In the first place, their main task was to cause a distraction, and since Logan hadn't asked for help, they were sure he was okay for now. So instead, without anyone saying anything, they were almost taking it in turns, seeing who could defeat the five spike.

'Right now, I think Sil must have the foresight ability.' Vorden thought. 'Usually, it allows the user to see a whole two seconds ahead of what the enemy is about to do. But with his powers…I wonder how much time he can see ahead of the others? Speed, super strength, and foresight, that's three out of the six so far. I wonder how much he has been practising with this set of abilities. The foresight ability is tricky to use and fight with at the same time.

'This is also the problem with Sil. Depending on those around him, he can be insanely strong or sub-par to the point where he can't even hurt a five spike Dalki.'

The others knew that Sil had far more up his sleeve, but since it looked like his first few attempts were unsuccessful, Nate decided to step forward.

"Oh..so that's what you guys are doing?" Fex said, having figured out their plan. "Well, why don't you all have a minute each? I'll keep the time. We all have two goes each, apart from me, of course, and after two rounds each with that big blob, we will all go in together to finish it off."

"And what if one of us kills the five spike before we get a chance to act together?" Raten asked.

"Well, that's just part of the game. You either go in earlier and defeat the five spike winning the match. If you go in later; maybe the five spike is injured, and you're able to figure out a way to defeat it with the knowledge of witnessing the others fight. Since you said the game was unfair last time, this sounds fairer. Especially since Sil has already had his turn." Fex said, looking down the line and smiling at the rest, ensuring they agreed with his words.

"Fine...but I will go next," Raten said, with his arms crossed.

Nate was able to pick up what the others were saying with his vampire's ears, and it lit a fire in him. Recently with all those around him, Nate had been feeling a bit down, but he was someone who obsessed over learning the best form of martial arts and finding strong opponents to face.

In the end, though, he discovered there were people with potential far above him who could grow much more powerful than him. However, with the shield, Shadow powers and a vampire body - the things he had obtained from the Cursed faction - How could he not blame himself for not being like the other monsters?

If anything, he had just as much opportunity as the others to grow strong. Seeing the Dalki attempt to punch him twice, Nate quickly avoided the hit.

'I saw his movements against Sil, and he was a bit slow. With the beast weapon active and the shield, I should be able to do something.'

After dodging the first two hits, Nate himself charged forward, running as fast as possible and threw out a punch. The two fists would slam into each other head-on, but the Dalki's fist was four times the size of Nate's.

But just then, the shield that was attached around the other arm of Nate's disappeared. At the same time, the shadow enveloped his fist, and the shield suddenly appeared in front of him the next moment.

The Dalki's fist banged into the shield, and the whole impact was absorbed inside, and the shield began to glow in the next second.

"I imagine that damn Graham must have already informed everyone about this shield by now. But there are still ways to trick you guys." Nate smiled.

The shield exploded with power. The power of the punch should have been twice as much as the impact, and it was what Nate had used so far. But when the bright light settled, the five spike Dalki looked completely fine without a scratch on its scales.

"Hmm, it makes you wonder... is the impact from the shield weak, or is this Dalki's defence just too strong?" Vorden thought.

Seeing this level of explosion, it seemed like a bit of both were the correct answer. Nate could tell that its own attack was weak, which meant he could never use its own power against this Dalki. If that didn't pierce its hard shell, what else could he do?

Attempting to hit it with his bare hands a couple of times, Nate successfully landed some solid hits and had even produced a hit similar to the hammer strike to put some internal damage, but the Dalki seemed alright.

After that, Nate's time was up, and he went back to join the others. The next to enter the field was Raten.

"Damn it," Nate expressed out loud. "A demon tier weapon, and I couldn't do anything with how weak its attack was and how slow it was. It's almost as if this Dalki was created to stall us. I think you were right when you called it a big blob."

Observing Raten, Vorden wondered if he could see an opening, a chip in its armour as one would say, but so far, he didn't find anything. Apart from running away from the blob due to its sheer size.

"One Horn was big as well, right?" Vorden asked.

"Yeah, actually, he was even a lot bigger, faster and stronger, but this guy's skin seems harder than his," Fex explained.

Hearing that, Vorden was thankful that someone like One Horn wasn't left behind. Otherwise, they really would have more trouble, or maybe not since Sil was probably strong enough to face him.

While watching Raten fight, others noticed that he was having the same trouble as everyone else. His mud-made blade hands smashed on impact as it hit the hard scales of the Dalki.

There seemed to be nothing he could do, but in the next moment, Raten climbed on top of the Dalki's head and formed his hand into something as small and pointy as a needle. With it, he stabbed Dalki in the eye. Soon after, though, the Dalki grabbed Raten and slammed him into the floor.

A part of Raten's mud-like body broke but regrouped together when he landed.

"You bastard, hahaha...I'll poke both of your eyes out until you die and bleed to death!" Raten laughed.

"Time!" Fex stated, informing Raten that it was time for him to step back.

"Well, Vorden, Peter, it has to be one of you?" Fex asked and soon saw Peter walking forward and punching his fist into the palm of his other hand, with his lesser weights following him.

"It's time to show you guys that Sil isn't the strongest in this group." Peter smiled.

*****

# Chapter 1547 - Another White

Everyone there knew that Peter was strong. He always had been, but the reason why he had never seemed somewhat impressive to the others was perhaps because of Quinn, who would always outshine him.

There was always someone more powerful, faster and more skilful, which was why even Vorden was thinking about what to do when it was his turn.

Right now, on top of that, Sil had already thought about combining his abilities as well.

"You guys can stop thinking about your turns because you're not going to need it," Peter stated.

The first one to approach the Dalki from his lesser weights was the new addition to the group - the four spiked humanoid Dalki with the long claws. Of course, it wasn't as strong as a five spike, but it wasn't far off.

In a way, it looked like the Dalki was there to test the waters.

"It looks like you can raise the dead and have pitted a new-gen against me. I'll be quite happy to crush this fool!" the five spike said.

As with all the other fights so far, though, when the five spike Dalki swung its arms and more, it was slow, slow enough that the four spike was able to dodge them with ease. It got its claws ready and started to swing them at the Dalki's arm that the latter had attacked it with.

Others heard the clashes, but the claws couldn't scratch the hard skin just like all the other attacks.

'In a way, this five spike Dalki is not much of a threat because it doesn't really have a way of attacking properly. Perhaps it still has the strength of a five spike, so if it could grab onto one of us, we would be in trouble, but it doesn't appear like that is going to happen anytime soon.' Vorden thought as he continued to analyse the fight. 'That's probably why even though being a five spike, it wasn't even considered one of the leaders. Either that or Graham had some way to fast track the Dalki to evolving and had only recently created this blob.'

Continuing to watch the fight, the Humanoid Dalki, under Peter's control, tried to do something else. It avoided the punches and constantly attacked the enemy's chest right where its heart would be. Moving in and out, the humanoid dalki was fast, almost like a vampire.

However, the five spike looked unafraid, and why would it be when the humanoid Dalki's claws couldn't even pierce through its body. Still, Peter and the other two lesser weights had yet to join the fight.

"You know, these humanoid Dalki have a special trait just like the five spiked." Peter started to speak, which was unusual for him. "But the humanoid Dalki, their traits seem to be more impressive than the five spiked Dalki. I've already won this competition."

The others were wondering just what Peter was talking about, but turning their heads for the first time, they saw a cut on the five spike Dalki's chest. It wasn't deep, and it was only a flesh wound, but the Dalki was clearly bleeding.

At the same time, the humanoid Dalki's claws were burning a hot red. After using the Humanoid Dalki to fight a little bit, Peter had noticed that the more it struck against someone or when it was fighting, its claws would change colour, and this wasn't just for some coolness factor. They were getting stronger and sharper during the fight while also producing some strange heat.

The humanoid Dalki right now was the perfect opponent against the enemy. This continued, and the claws were scratching off more scales and making the five spike bleed more, but then something else happened.

For the first time, when the Dalki threw a punch, it had almost hit the humanoid Dalki.

'Damn it, the Dalki's special trait. The more they bleed, the faster they get. Now that blob is actually becoming quite a fast blob. Hurting it more is only going to make this job harder for me.' Vorden thought.

"Now, it's time for us to act," Peter said.

The humanoid Dalki pulled back, and in return, Peter came forward instead. When it threw out a fist, Peter jumped up and showed that he was even faster than the Humanoid Dalki, and the speed had impressed the others as well.

"You know, I never chimed in or got involved with this little match of yours," Jake, the vampire leader who had come along with the group but stayed silent for nearly most of everything, began to speak. In the first place, he wasn't really close to any of them, and his closest person was Peter, who never talked much.

"But that was because I was confident that he could deal with it all himself."

Bringing out his strange baton, Peter used all his strength and slammed the weapon down towards the ground. This gave a chance for his two other lesser wights to come in. Legs moved and spun around, digging her tail right into the Dalki's chest.

It cut through the hard scales easily, but after piercing a few inches, it came to a sudden halt.

"Hahaha!" the five spike Dalki hollered, "You finally managed to pierce me, but it's not enough!"

It was at that moment that Legs did something strange. It moved away and detached its tail, leaving it in the five spike Dalki's body. The next second, with its foot's bottom, it kicked its own tail deeper into the five spike's chest.

The great pain caused the five spike, forcing it to tumble as the tail inched closer to his heart.

"Don't worry; we just need to kill you so she can get her tail back!" Peter shouted, but he wasn't the next one to strike. Rather, it was the headless Hilston. He spun on his toes and activated the beast gear on his body, and he, too, punched the end of the tail.

It was a good thing that Slicer's tail was one of the strongest things in existence because the punch was sure to break most things. Due to the punch, the tail moved in deeper and had somewhat pierced the Dalki's heart. It could feel it, but it still wasn't dead yet.

"Hey, I have to be the one that finished you off!" Peter shouted as he swung both his fists back, then running forward and jumping in the air, he thrust them both ahead at the same time with all his strength. As his fists hit the bottom part of the tail, it not only pierced through the Dalki's heart but continued through to the other end, and the next second, the five spike Dalki fell to the floor.

The others were speechless as they watched what had happened. Vorden had planned so much in trying to defeat the five spike, and Sil thought that he was the only one, the only one out of the whole group, who could take down the five spike Dalki.

"When did he get so strong?" Raten complained. "He freaking won the contest, didn't he?"

"I mean, there wasn't a prize or anything," Fex replied, wondering what the big deal was. "But yeah, Peter won."

Pulling the tail out from the Dalki, Peter threw it over to Legs, who got it with her feet. She then somehow managed to attach it back onto herself, which was a bizarre sight for the others to witness.

"Alright, Blob, it's time for you to wake up. You are my final fourth piece. With scales like that, I'll have an unbeatable team." Peter smiled.

A few seconds later, the others were quite surprised as they saw the large blob standing up from the ground once again. It looked the same as before, but now it had a hole in its chest.

"Holy Sh*t! You can do that?! You should have been there when One Horn died!" Fex shouted and now felt like he should have kept his body intact rather than used it for green blood, but that was a must at the time.

However, something soon caught Fex's attention. He turned his head and could see a large figure flying their way. It landed on the ground the next second, causing them all to startle.

"It's the dragon!" Vorden shouted.

Immediately, Peter went to get out of there with his Lesser weights; he wasn't in the best position after all. Everyone moved away quite fast, all for one, of course. The dragon looked down at the blob and immediately jerked its head forward, grabbing the five spike beast.

Lifting its head, they could see it hanging in its mouth. When it closed its jaw, its teeth ripped through the hard scales they all struggled even to scratch a few seconds ago, and after a few chews, it swallowed the beast, and that was the end of it.

*****

# Chapter 1548 - Half A Demon

Logan and Layla saw they were too late in stopping Jim's clone from unleashing the demon tier beast dragon. But they were still hopeful that perhaps they could figure out a way to put it back and place it in the same state it was once in.

'There has to be a way. The Dalki's managed to capture it and sedate it once. Which means we can do the same thing as well.' Logan thought.

The encasing around his arm had already fallen off, revealing his Dalki self. At the same time, Logan placed both his hands on the floor, and his eyes started to light up green. Upon noticing that there were intruders, Jim's clone and the Dalki immediately charged forward.

However, the next second, some of the wires seemed to come to life and had wrapped around their bodies. The vampire clone Jim slashed through them straight away, but it gave Layla enough time to fire an arrow full of Qi and aim it right in its face, thus killing it.

"Are you sure we didn't need him and his brain?" Layla asked.

"I have all the information he already has in here!" Logan shouted, charging forward. Although Logan wasn't as powerful as the others, and these were three spiked Dalki he was going up against, he still was a good fighter and had his suit on with him.

He charged in, running right underneath one of their arms. At the same time, while the Dalki was looking at Logan, two more arrows fired at the same time pierced them in the side of the head. They hadn't gone quite deep enough because of hard scales, but jumping up, Logan grabbed the arrow with his Dalki arm pushing it in further, killing it on the spot.

Now there was only one Dalki to deal with, but they could see that all of the wires had gone off from the demon tier beast, and the liquid was draining from the container as well. Logan was distracted looking at the demon tier beast and was hit by the other Dalki right in the chest.

Layla caught Logan mid flight with her powers and safely placed him down as she got her sword ready and unleashed one of the black balls. When hitting the Dalki, The spiritual chains held it in place. She didn't activate the sword this time and started to strike at the Dalki again and again.

She avoided its hits, but the sword seemed to be somewhat blunt as it could not pierce through its skin. Now being able to use Qi on them instead, she had five arrows hovering around her back while in the middle of the fight and using her sword. When she saw an opening, one of the arrows would aim for the Dalki's head or heart.

In the end, they finished off the last Dalki too. Logan had recovered and ran over to the console, but the Dragon had flapped its wings as the base's ceiling started to open. When it fully opened, the last thing the two of them saw was the Demon tier beast flying out of the base.

"We screwed up!" Layla said. "The demon tier beast is free. What if it runs away?!"

Looking at the sky and where it was heading, Logan felt like it wasn't going to run away for some reason.

"I think that would be the better option if it ran away. If it decides to fight us...then the only thing we can do is fight back."

Reporting back to Linda, Logan made her aware of the situation, and he then contacted the others as well.

"Don't worry; we know it's here!" Vorden replied back. "It's right in front of us."

This was what Logan feared. It looked like the only option they might have was to fight the beast head-on and kill It.

"Come on; we have to help them, Layla. They might need every help that we can give them. The demon tier beast just woke up. It's probably a bit dizzy, and I saw that they already took away a lot of energy from it. You were right; if we have any chance of beating that thing, the time is now." Logan said.

Although he didn't say anything about the special black sword yet, he thought if it was able to work against the Helen Dalki, it might work against the Dragon. They were still unaware of the side effects or where the sword came from, but now was not the time to worry about those things.

On the other side of the Lab, Linda had just received a news update from Logan about what had happened. Now she was in the middle of a conundrum.

'Should I go help out the others…I don't think there are even anymore Dalki or vampire clones in the lab. All of them are most probably killed…but then I can't leave Borden...'

Glancing to her side, she noticed he was peacefully asleep in the glass container. His body had already regained its normal size and was floating there; whatever was happening, it had worked so far. She kept an eye on the terminal as per Logan's instructions.

Some of the energy transferred to him was coming from the Demon tier beast; however, it looked like there was still enough energy to be extracted and was either stored somewhere or was in the pipes for Borden to continue whatever he was going through.

'I'll stay here until you need me, guys. I hope you will get through this.'

——

So far, on the journey to the Dalki main base, none of them felt fear when fighting against the Dalki, not even when they went up against the five spike Dalki. It was only now that they had seen the Demon tier beast landing in front of them did they become very cautious.

Its sense of power was beaming from its body, and everyone at the scene could feel it; however, the final nail in the coffin was the fact that it had so easily crushed the Dalki that all of them were struggling to even scratch.

"What's the plan, Vorden?!" Raten asked.

The Dragon looked their way and flared its nostrils. It was clear that it wasn't just going to let them buy time. In fact, the next second, it flapped its wings, producing a large gust and roared so loud the sound almost blasted their ears drums.

However, two figures were unaffected by the scream and could move at that moment. Those figures were Legs and Hilston. Under Peter's order, they moved in front of the beast. And it looked like they were about to repeat what they had done last time.

Spinning with her tail, and building momentum using the strength of her tail, she swung her tail against the Dragon's front Legs. However, unlike what had happened with the five spiked Dalki, there wasn't a single scratch on the beast after the attack.

What had worked for the last time didn't work this time.

"We were planning to face this monster anyway, so we have to fight. If we can't hurt its scales, then we go for its eyes! Last time, the dragon was dealt with, it faced off against six spiked Dalki that Jim had artificially created. So We can also defeat this thing!"

However, Raten knew that if the five spiked Dalki couldn't pierce it, what could he or Vorden do. Even though they were both Demon tier beasts, this one was clearly at another level.

"I think I heard of this beast before that the vampires fought it long ago!" Jake shouted.

It was then that the great Dragon swung its tail. All of them decided to avoid the blow in their own way. Vorden flew up in the air, others jumped, and Raten turned into mud, sinking in the ground.

The tail had missed them all and only missed Fex by a few inches. But they noticed that the tail wasn't slow despite the beast's size.

"Tell us, Jake! How did the vampires defeat the beast?!" Fex asked.

Realising the vampires were the ones that had initially caught it, they must have had found a way.

"The originals..the originals worked alongside the leaders to take it down, and soon after were put back to sleep…this beast was something that nearly defeated the strongest vampires of that time."

# Chapter 1549 - Seeing Everything

The whole group was still in the giant crater. It now felt like they were doing battle in a giant arena against such a beast. A beast that perhaps might be too much for them to take on.

"That's good news!" Raten shouted, overhearing the conversation that went on between Fex and Jake. "If the vampire originals were able to take down this thing, and the six spike Dalki, then it means it's not impossible. We can do it as well."

At this point and time, Fex wasn't too sure, and he remembered that last time, his strings were practically useless against this thing.

Rushing onto the field before anyone else, though, was Sil, who grabbed both Legs and headless Hilston and chucked them back as far as possible. The next second, the Dragon's feet stomped the ground, and the impact led to the destruction of the surface. Rocks were chucked out in a circle along with a radiating energy, which Sil was able to jump over at the right time.

When landing, he placed both hands on the ground, and a giant wall of earth appeared from the floor. A wall that was as enormous as the Dragon.

"Peter, order your wights out of this fight!" Sil shouted. "I'm telling you now, if they stay in the fight, they will die. Everyone, just do your best and follow my instructions when you can."

Sil moved to the right using his super-speed, and the next second, the Dragon burst through the wall. Its head is the place Sil stood a few seconds ago. It was then that Vorden remembered something.

"Everyone, listen to Sil. He has the foresight ability; he can see what will happen next. If we listen to him, we might be able to get out of this!" Vorden ordered. Usually, he was the one in command, but he was quick to know when there was someone better and when there was not.

Then, flying in the air, Vorden tried to get a better view, but as soon as he ascended, the large Dragon flapped its wings again, generating a strong wind force from them, but thankfully, Vorden's wings were sturdier.

The type of beast he was, was a strange one in the first place. His wings were heavy, strong, and sharp as well, yet he could still fly with them.

"I am a Demon tier beast as well, and you are only half of that. I refuse to believe that you are so much stronger than me!" Vorden cried.

He soon shifted through the wind creating a large gust of wind through his constantly swinging his arms. Each time Vorden did, a powerful wind strike would shift through the air. In doing so, it hit the Dragon on the tip of its nose.

It sounded like a sword was bashing against its face, and although it didn't break the scales, it was clearly annoying the beast to some degree. In anger, the Dragon looked like it wished to move, but when looking down, only to see one of its legs sinking into the ground and it struggled to pull the legs out.

This was Raten's doing. He was also a Demon tier beast, and his powers were far stronger than he had previously let on. His powers allowed him to turn any substances into the same mud from which his body was made. The only thing was that Raten liked to fight in hand to hand combat.

Still, he had turned the ground underneath into a pit of endless mud. Usually, the Dragon would have been able to lift its other leg, but it was unable to this time. This was because its other leg had landed into one of the traps that the sixth family leader had set up.

"It really stepped right where you said it would." Jake smiled. His ability wasn't strong enough to stop the whole Dragon from moving, but if activated at the right moment, he could stop at least one part of Dragon's body: the other leg. The problem was trying to trick it into stepping into his trap.

However, with Sil being able to tell the Dragon's next movements, Jake didn't have to lure or trick the Dragon. He knew exactly where it would go.

"Nate, are you ready?!" Sil shouted.

Since it could not move, the Dragon was getting desperate. It decided to use one part of its body that was strong, flexible and quick: its gigantic tail. The Dragon then took a large swing at everyone once again, and Nate braced himself with the shield in his hand.

The Demon tier shield was meant to absorb the energy, so in theory, there was no need to brace himself, but seeing such a gigantic tail swing at him at such a speed, he couldn't help but worry.

The middle part of the tail bashed into the shield and stopped that instant. It was, without a doubt, a Demon tier weapon. At times, Nate would doubt its strength, but being able to withstand the impact from a Demon tier beast's tail proved its worth.

"Throw me the shield!" Sil shouted, and Nate chucked it like a frisbee. Seeing where it was going to go, Sil leapt up, grabbing the shield, and held it out towards the Dragon's body. It lit up in blue light, and now the Dragon had to deal with twice the power of its own tail attack.

A blast so strong left the shield that it went out in one bang and covered the whole body of the Dragon. Immediately, its legs lifted, and it fell to its side, shaking the entire ground as it fell to the floor.

'I can't believe it.' Fex said, witnessing the whole battle. 'With Demon tier beasts, demon tier items and Sil… they are really taking out the beast against which we stood no chance before?'

To top it off, as the beast head fell to the floor, there was one person waiting for it at the exact spot where he needed to be as per Sil's instructions.

"There is a reason why you're there and not me...because, without a doubt, you are stronger than me." Sil smiled.

Throwing out his fist, Peter threw a punch as strong as possible. His veins all over his body tensed, because he wasn't going to hold back even a single ounce of his strength and attacked as if his whole life depended on it. The Dragon noticed that Peter was aiming for its large eye and tried to shut the eyelid, but Peter was far too fast.

His fist went straight through the eye, and the power of the punch itself exploded within it, causing a gush of blood to pour out everywhere, and its head to swing about widely in the air.

Flying through the air, Vorden landed next to his brother Sil. It was clear the fist had hurt the beast, but a single damaged eye wasn't going to kill it.

"What do we do now?" Vorden asked.

Soon, the Dragon's body started to glow green, and as it got up on its two feet, Peter and the others moved away from it once again, surrounding it in a circle. The next second, its scales were no longer green, and when it opened its eye...to their shock, the eye was once again in a perfect condition.

"This f*cker can heal itself!" Peter yelled.

"Don't worry; there's one more piece to all of this," Sil reassured.

Coming out from the side and into the crater were two more people. One had already transformed into her true Hannyma state, while the other had his Dalki hand out. Layla leapt up as Logan threw her, pushing the bottom of her feet towards the Dragon.

Holding out her sword, Layla had it activated as the markings on it began to glow. And intense pain rushed through her head, but she didn't dare to back down in this situation.

As she flew through the air, strings had suddenly wrapped around the head of the Dragon, and Fex attempted to pull down on it. The Dragon, of course, lifted its head, easily breaking the string.

"Well, at least I can be a distraction. Are all lizards this stupid?" Fex said out loud.

This allowed Layla to get through with no trouble, and her black sword pierced right in the Dragon's long neck. She let go and quickly landed on the surface, leaving the sword stuck in the neck.

"That sword is special...the dragon shouldn't be able to heal while the sword is inside its body," Layla shouted as she stumbled upon landing and tried to maintain her balance. The more she used the sword, the worse it affected her, and the time left for how long she could use it was declining rather than increasing.

On the way, based on the information Logan had gathered from the database, he knew the Dragon was capable of this, and it looked like someone else knew all of this was going to happen.

"Just how far in the future can you see?" Vorden asked, but he didn't receive any response because Sil's chest had suddenly begun to glow.

"Enough to see that I will be the one to kill this beast," Sil replied as he slowly raised his head and stared at the Demon tier beast, the Dragon.

*****

# Chapter 1550 - Blade's Quest Complete
Out of the corner of Vorden's eye, he could see something glowing from Sil's chest. Seeing this, Vorden felt like his eyes were playing tricks on him because there were only two things that this could possibly be, and for some reason, he didn't think it was the first.

When the brothers had found out about Blade island, they wished to know more about their father Hilston Blade. Why he did the things he did, and the reason behind them. In the end, they had received their answers from Brock, who was one of Richard's most trusted vampires.

During that time, they found out that Hilston had a strange complex - a complex to constantly get stronger by searching for new power through his blood. He had a plan to take over someone else's body if he found them stronger than him while carrying the Blade family powers.

Sil was the first one, the first Blade family member to wield six abilities at once. The strongest blade in terms of ability-wise in existence, yet that wasn't the only reason why Hilston was obsessed with Sil; instead, it was because Hilston believed that Sil could very well be the first one ever to unleash a soul weapon.

It didn't take long for Vorden to see what Sil was doing. When the glow over his chest dimmed and slowly died out, everyone else noticed a book in front of him. The strange-looking book was a mesh of different colours, like a mixed rainbow.

"Sil, is that a soul weapon? An item type soul weapon!" Vorden exclaimed.

Of course, now wasn't the time for Sil to answer. He soon opened the book and turned to several pages. Upon reaching the right pages, Sil would close his eyes, and a strange glow from the book would go through Sil's chest.

He did this a few times and eventually placed the book away. Putting it back inside his chest. Vorden was confused, to say the least. Soul weapons, even item types, were normally used in combat. To help them fight, a finisher moves per se or a final stand. Yet Sil had summoned it then put it away.

"Everyone!" Sill shouted, and suddenly, both his arms lit up blue, and his hair was standing on its end. In his hand were two solid forms of lightning. The next second, a strike from the sky appeared, and Sil was seen right above the Dragon's head.

Sil slammed down the two pure bolts of lightning into the Dragon's head. One had gone through the eye that Peter had initially damaged, and the other had gone between its nose and disappeared. Everyone had seen the pure lightning bolt get through the skin of the Dragon.

'This doesn't make any sense... It has been over 24 hours since Sil touched anyone with the lightning ability...how is he able to do that?'

It didn't stop there, as Sil held on tightly onto the Dragon's head. With his super speed, he quickly moved to the Dragon's ear and hung on the edge. Then using his hand, a spark of solid white light began to form.

The others weren't sure what happened, but they heard an incredibly loud bang in the next second. A sonic blast had hit the Dragon in its ear, bursting whatever it had of its eardrum. Its head flung to the side, and Sil fell towards the ground, but he didn't stop there.

While in midair, he transformed his body into a bolt of lightning, shooting himself after the falling Dragon. A second before his momentum came to a complete stop, Sil threw his fist, hitting the side of the Dragon's face, right on the snout.

Everyone heard a loud impact again, and the Dragon's face swung faster, and it looked like its whole body was falling to the ground.

"Wait.. that power... I'm sure Sil's punch has gotten more powerful." Nate noticed.

Sil still had the demon tier shield, and sure he was relying on a boost from the weapon, but that wasn't the main reason. It was all because of his soul weapon.

While the Dragon had fallen onto its side, Sil wasn't giving it a chance to rest. He made a single pure large lightning bolt, this time in his other hand, and it was far larger than anything they had ever seen Owen create.

Sil's whole right arm was lightning up blue as he held the bolt of lightning in his hand and threw it, causing it to pierce right through the Dragon's wing in an instant. Beaming with energy, the bolt stayed stuck in the wing and began to pulsate.

With each pulse, it shocked the Dragon's whole body, and in response, the Dragon roared. It looked like the shocks from the lightning had stunned it in a spot, keeping it paralysed. At the same time, the black sword was stopping it from healing like how it healed its eye.

Seeing this, Sil's body started to levitate, revealing another power they hadn't seen until this point. He went up through the clouds to the point where the others couldn't see him while the bolt continued to shock the Dragon.

'I know the Dragon is weaker compared to what it was before...it had its energy drained, but how can Sil injure it to this degree?' Vorden thought.

Seeing the amount of power Sil was displaying right now reminded Fex of something. This power level was almost the same as Sil had shown when going up against Nicu.

Everything that Sil was doing now, everything he was showing, was all due to his Soul weapon. The book was no ordinary book. It was almost like a personal diary that was made just for Sil. Each book page signified each ability he had ever copied during his lifetime.

The book allowed Sil to switch out any of his current abilities, with any of those in the book, and in the book itself, Sil had all of the powers of the Big four, including all of their MC cells. It didn't matter if he hadn't touched the others within 24 hours or not, now that he had the book.

Sil had managed to do something that Hilston had never achieved, not just creating a soul weapon but overcoming the weakness of the Blade family ability. With this soul weapon, no matter where Sil was or who he was with, he could reach his strongest.

Right now, no one could see where Sil was, and on the ground, they noticed that the pain was now becoming bearable for the Dragon. It started to lift its body, ripping its wings as they tore through the pure lightning bolt.

"What are you guys doing? Kill that thing!" Peter shouted as he charged forward with his familiars. The Dragon was clearly slow as Peter proceeded to punch it.

Seeing this, the others followed suit, attacking it with blood powers, even emptying their MC cells and Qi, to injure the Dragon even more. Unlike before, the hits it was taking now seemed to affect it somewhat.

Even if they couldn't get through the scales, they could still hurt it, and that was exactly what they were aiming for. However, one part of its body recovered faster than any other, and that was its tail. Once again, the Dragon swung its tail towards anyone who was at the back, and the one that was at the back this time around....was Fex.

He knew that the Dragon's blows were powerful. If he got slapped by this tail, it was probably the end of his life. They had all avoided a strike thanks to Sil's foresight ability.

"Don't worry..I know what's going to happen. My brother will save you." Sil said from above.

As the tail came towards Fex, he placed his hand on the ground and made a blood barrier, but the tail broke through that in an instant. Closing his eyes, he braced himself until he saw a full-sized what looked like a humanoid Dalki get in between him and the incoming tail.

It grabbed the tail in place, holding it with all its strength, stopping it, and then threw it to the side. When turning around, the others could see him.

"Borden!" Fex said. "You saved my life...and you're... big now! Is this permanent?...wait...you have five spikes!"

"I think it's permanent," Borden replied.

Perhaps if Sil's attack didn't already weaken the Dragon and made it dizzy, the tail would have hit them both, but everything, including Borden now having five spikes, was seen by Sil through his ability.

The Dragon lifted its head, and the next second, Sil came down from the sky, shooting down like a torpedo and slammed right on top of the Dragon's head. Pushing it down into the crater so hard that it lifted its back legs, and the crater expanded even more. They had gone so deep into the land that ponds of water were starting to form, but they could see Sil stood there on top of the Dragon, having defeated it.

"I...I was saving that for Graham...but this was a good test as well." Sil smiled.

Only the next second and the Dragon began to break down into particles. Bit by bit, its body was disappearing.

"What's happening?" Layla asked.

"I think...we killed the dragon," Logan replied, not knowing whether this was a good thing or a bad thing.

*****

# Chapter 1551 - Destroy Everything
It was the first time the group saw this happen to a beast. After they had dealt with it, the Dragon's body split into thousands of light particles, and it slowly began to disappear. To the people at the scene who had been to the familiar world, it reminded them of what they had seen in the familiar world.

After waiting a while, there was nothing left of the Dragon, and the light particles had vanished right in front of their very eyes. Everyone stayed there in the crater for a moment, not saying anything. They were exhausted and had expended all of their energy and MC cells.

It was the same for Sil as well. He didn't hold back when using the MC cells he had gathered because he knew he couldn't take this battle lightly because his foresight had revealed what would have happened if he had hesitated any bit. The only ones left somewhat standing due to not doing much was Logan and Linda, who had arrived with Borden.

Everyone started to make their way out of the crater, and once reaching the edge, they sat down facing the tower. They wanted to ask about Borden, see if he was okay now or not. After all, he had now become a five spike.

They now had the type of Dalki as an ally which they once had the most challenging time confronting. But they knew it wasn't the time to celebrate because there was something else on their minds.

"This... isn't good, is it?" Linda asked. "You said that we were meant to capture the Dragon, report back to Sam before we dealt with it. Isn't there a chance that it will combine with the other one in the shadow space now and mess things up!"

This was why all of them worried because they somewhat knew this was what was most probably going to happen.

"I'm sorry." Sil eventually said. "I couldn't hold back. I could tell the Dragon would have found a way to get the black sword out from its neck. It would have then healed itself. I would have run out of MC cells, and we would have never defeated that thing....it would have killed us all. Simply put, if I didn't go all out and kill it, then we would all be dead by now."

Although Vorden didn't know how far ahead Sil could see in the future, based on everything he was saying, it was pretty far ahead, but now that Sil had exhausted his MC cells, it would be next to nothing.

"We might not have to worry too much," Logan said as he looked at the crater where the battle had just occurred. "Although we can't be sure, I have a theory. When the vampires dealt with the Dragon Demon tier beast before, it would usually split itself into two parts whenever it was in a weakened state or close to death.

"This seems like a survival instinct more than anything. Sure two dragons might be better at fighting, but then why not just stay in two separate forms the whole time? I believe, as I said, it's to survive. One half continues to fight while the other half runs away.

"Now, why would it run away? The answer is, even if you kill one half, it won't immediately rejoin the other. It needs to buy time. I believe this is why we also found one half of the Dragon appearing on earth in an attempt to go as far away as possible so it could survive or as Quinn said, it was attracted to the tablet's energy and was trying to heal itself.

"Either way, my point is, I think Quinn is not in immediate danger."

The group was ready to set off, but before they did, Logan checked for any other signs of the Dalki or vampire clones for reassurance.

"So you're a five spike now?" Vorden asked.

"Yeah." Borden showed off his back. "And I guess this means I can't ride on your shoulder anymore. Now that I'm as big as you."

"And you don't feel like killing us all, right?" Peter shouted over, making sure that was the critical part. "If you do, I just lost my own five spiked Dalki. We could always bring you back from the dead."

Hearing this, the others were unsure if Peter was making a joke or not. Judging by his expression, it didn't seem to be.

"Well, I'm pleased that everything went well, and you have a body of your own. You should have a special trait like the others as well. Maybe you can help out in this war a lot." Vorden smiled.

"I think he can help out now," Logan said, turning around and taking something off his back. They could all see it was a portable teleporter once he set it up.

"I tried to get in contact with Sam, but he's not responding. This is making me slightly worried that there could be something serious going on at the moment at the settlement. Who knows what happened while we were here.

"But before we go, we need to destroy the whole lab; we need to make sure that they can't use any of this machinery. We are close to concluding this war....but if we don't end it now, we have to make sure there is no chance of them ever coming back from this again."

Logan and Borden went back into the laboratory. There was a room filled with the energy of the demon tier beast, and at the same time, plenty of crystals they could use. With the use of his powers and knowledge, it was pretty easy for them to make sure the lab would blow up.

"Whoa..so you can really do that?" Borden asked in amazement.

"Not just that..we are going to destroy this whole Dalki base planet...Borden, there was something that I didn't say to the others...and it's about you..." Logan paused there while the two of them continued inside the lab.

"I know...my life span...it's still short, right? I still only have a few years to live like the other Dalki. You don't have to say anything, I can tell, and destroying the lab, killing the demon tier beast completely rather than finding a way to heal me, is the right choice. I just want to enjoy the rest of my time with my brothers.

"I really thank you from the bottom of my heart that you have allowed me to help fight side by side with them again."

Logan felt guilty in a way, but he was glad that Borden understood. However, maybe if they could find someone strong enough to take out the demon tier dragon without loss of innocent lives, Logan would have time to work on the way to increase Borden's lifespan.

But he reckoned the Dragon they had fought today was around a quarter of its regular strength, and he was sure it would have been a nightmare to fight the real thing. After getting to the lab, Logan began to set up bombs in the lab using the devices around him.

The idea was to set off a strong enough explosion where it went deep down, reaching the core. It was easier to do because the planet was an artificial one in the first place. Logan could see the less dense areas, and it was easy for him to create a hole in the centre.

Once he had placed the bombs, it was time for them to head back. Logan could see them all waiting but still weak and tired, standing by the teleporter.

"We don't know what the vampire settlement is going to be like," Logan said. "We really don't...and I know you are all weak and tired...but this is the last leg. This is the last attack force of the Dalki, and then there is only Graham left."

Although Logan spoke these words, he kept his great discovery to himself. Right now, they didn't need to know what they could be running into once reaching the other side.

After Longan pressed a few buttons on his strange bio-mechanic arm, the teleporter jammer was disabled, and it also set off the bombs. Simultaneously, the group began to jump through the teleporter heading back to the vampire settlement to see what state it was in.

*****

# Chapter 1552 - The Last Dalki Mother Ship

The lab exploded as everyone left through the teleporter, and it continued until it reached the central core of the planet, where the Dalki created a special device to keep all of the different terrains together.

On top of that, it was powered by crystals and thanks to the new type of crystals they had received, Logan was able to create powerful explosive apparatuses.

In the next second, the core was destroyed, but the explosions didn't cease, and the different terrains began to break off from each other. The powerful force made them drift apart as they slowly turned into nothing in the endless space.

All of the Dalki motherships that were on the planet were gone. And with this, all the Dalki motherships that had gone out to attack those in the beast planet solar system had also vanished. Now there were only a few stray dalki ships and one Dalki mothership left, which was heading to the Daisy faction.

After Sam and the vampire leaders had split up from the others to head back to the Daisy planet, they reached only to witness an ongoing battle between the vampires and the Dalki.

The final battle in this war wasn't between Humans and Dalki; instead, it was between the vampires against the Dalki - it was between the creators versus their creations.

———

Before the other arrived, The knights that had been left behind were in charge of their respective families, but rather than coop up in their castles instead, there were forces outside the settlement.

Many forces were on top of the wall, and they had already set up the defence mechanism.

What was a little strange was the vampires were expecting them to somewhat attack from above. For the mother ship itself to hover and send out forces or, rather, a mixture of space and land battle, but they did no such thing.

A few hundred metres away from the settlement, the mother ship landed in the meadows, crushing the grass and flowers underneath it. The Dalki army began to descend from the ship, all of them being three spiked and four spiked Dalki, and numbering around a hundred, then there was one humanoid Dalki, who looked to be the leader of this Dalki force.

Unlike the reports so far, though the humanoid Dalki looked quite different compared to the rest, which would have made it obvious if they had a special trait, this one, however, looked like a regular Dalki.

It was just as tall as the others, and its arms, tails and other features were also identical to the Dalki around it. Only the head and the body looked human, making it easy for others to differentiate it from the other Dalki.

None of the vampires recognised what human the Dalki was based on, but that didn't matter. It was clear now why they had decided to land away. The Dalki were gathering their forces because they had most probably received the reports as well.

Now, the Dalki couldn't just charge in and attack one by one like they felt like they could in the past. They were going to spearhead and attack the Shelter together.

"The leaders said that they would be coming back soon!" Silver shouted to the other vampires. With her brother being one of the Royal Knights and her being stronger than most knights, she took charge of the whole force.

"However, are we really such a group of beings that need to rely on a select few vampires? They are attacking our home! Our king warned them to try and take on this place, and he stated that this place was unbeatable. So let's prove his words right!"

The vampires weren't tense even without their leaders. Instead, they stood confident, ready to fight. Not only because of their own powers but also because of the wall itself, which was filled with countless towers and statues on the outside.

Looking out, Silver saw the humanoid Dalki raise its hand, and that was the signal for it all to begin. The Dalki's began to rush forward in a somewhat tactical position. As the fodder and shield of the group, all three spiked Dalki were at the front, while the four spikes were right behind them.

They continued to run, and the vampires did next to nothing. Their blood powers couldn't reach that far. However, this didn't mean they were planning just to stand still until the Dalki's stepped into their range.

"What is that?" One of the Dalki said, and they could all see it. The towers at the front, which surrounded the walls, all began to light up and immediately started to fire out towards the Dalki. A large explosion of beast energy, more potent than any blast from a ship that the Dalki's on the battlefield had ever faced. It crashed into the middle of them.

The blast wasn't enough to kill the three spikes, but it was clearly affecting them, as they were hurt, and a few were even bleeding due to the heat and force. The towers began to light up again as they were getting ready to fire once more.

"Push forward! we have already gotten this far!" The Humanoid Dalki leader shouted.

"Are the Dalki really this stupid? I wonder why we were so worried about them in the first place..." Silver thought upon noticing this.

As the Dalki somewhat injured and moved on, the gargoyle statues suddenly began to break free from the wall and soon leapt, only to crash into the forces.

On the other hand, as the Dalki also got within the range, the vampires began to unleash their blood powers and continued to fire it at the incoming Dalki, making sure none of them got too close.

Still, these Dalki were strong, and they managed to get through despite all of the firepower. Soon it was time for Silver, along with her knights, to make their move as well. They leapt from the top of the tower and landed on the surface, adding themselves to the strong force of around three hundred vampires already fighting at the scene.

She saw a Dalki almost punching one of the vampires, but on her way down, she wrapped her string around its arm, stopping it, and then pulled on it while moving her forward and stabbing the Dalki on its right side of the chest.

It wasn't dead, and it was hard for her to pull out her sword, but eventually, she did, and the green blood of the Dalki gushed out. Raising the sword closer to her lips, she soon licked it, which in turn increased her strength even more.

"We can win this fight without our leaders…we will prove to them that this is something we can handle without them." Silver cried.

The fight was tough, for the three spiked Dalki were nearly a similar strength or stronger than the knights they currently had. If it weren't for the fact that they outnumbered the Dalki, had the tower and gargoyles for support and lastly, that the green blood of Dalki empowered them, they perhaps would be miserably losing the fight.

But at this moment, the fighting was somewhat even and balanced. The vampires lost three times as many forces as the Dalki, but because the number of individuals on both sides had a huge difference, it looked like both sides were evenly matched on the battlefield.

During the fight, the humanoid Dalki hadn't done much apart from occasionally turning his head and looking at the mothership as if he was waiting for something or someone.

"If nothing changes..we will win this battle." The humanoid Dalki mumbled to itself.

However, at that moment, something did change. Turning his head, he witnessed a vampire leap from the wall and just as it was about to land, it suddenly threw some of its blood and it immediately exploded hitting the Dalki below.

Another one falling from the wall wrapped itself in a cape, blocking a Dalki's hit, and then stabbed it through the chest, killing it on the spot. Then, another grabbed one with red blood string and flung them over to the other side.

"It's..the leaders!" Silver smiled, happy to see the father and the rest of them. Not all the leaders were there. A few had perished in the war, and while a few were on another battlefield, like Jake and Vincent. But this was the boost the vampires needed to lean the balance of the battle on their side.

# Chapter 1553 - Dalki Trump Card

A group of people were heading towards the vampire settlement where the current battle was taking place. They were currently travelling via spaceship rather than teleporter. It wouldn't be long till they arrived anyway, and there was another reason why Sam had decided to travel via ship.

"Have we had any match of Dalki energy readings apart from that on the vampire settlement?" Sam asked for a report from his team.

"No, I'm sorry, Sam. I know you're trying to find Graham, but we can't find him anywhere." Chucky replied. "The last time we heard of him and knew his whereabouts was when he was facing Sunny. The vampires who had left the planet have returned, and this is what they had to report."

They were now seeing the video footage on the screen, captured by the small combat ship. Rokene had left Sunny behind as per her instructions, but in the end, it was too much for him. He felt guilty and convinced his partner to turn the ship around and try to save Sunny.

However, all they could see was what Sam was looking at now. It was a destroyed wasteland, a giant crater in the floor that looked like it had caused a nuclear bomb, but the strangest thing in the video was the subclasses. There were no signs of the subclasses anywhere, just their blood, and there was no sign of Sunny's body either.

"Where did all the bodies go… I don't understand. Did Graham eat them, like he ate his own people?" Sam asked, not expecting an answer.

"We aren't sure, but at the moment, we have to presume she's dead. The energy reading device that was placed on the planet was destroyed as well." Chucky added to the report.

It wasn't as if Sam believed they could beat Graham, but maybe they could slow him down. Sam knew that they needed to finish that fight; if Graham joined, the whole settlement could be done for. On top of that, the report from Quinn's side told them the latter was still not done yet.

'I'm sorry to say this, Quinn, but what the f*ck are you doing?! So many people have died in this war. What was the point of you getting this crystal if you were just going to be out of the whole war?' Sam inwardly said to himself, nearly pulling out his hair. It was the first time he had criticised Quinn like this, even if it was in his head.

The toll of the war was getting to him; they had a tough time, and they were getting close to the end, yet even after everything they had done, he still felt they needed to rely on Quinn more than ever.

While in the middle of these thoughts, Sam suddenly received an update from Logan. He informed Sam about his discovery in the lab. His eyes lit up, and he was at a loss for words. Turning around, he began to give out instructions.

"Alright, stop this search; we have to head straight back to the settlement. We have to help them now before it's too late."

———

Somewhere in the vampire solar system, on a swampy-like beast planet, a group of vampires stood exhausted, encircling a region, and facing outwards. Fighting against the beasts was easy to do, but with how many were coming towards them, even they couldn't imagine.

Beasts were piling up on top of each other, floating in the water. They had killed so many that the other beasts would have to leap over the bodies or tear through them if they wanted to continue to attack the vampires by the ship.

Still, thankfully the fifth and fourth family, with these two groups, could rest, and as for the engineers, they had finally fixed the ship. Even the beasts were now decreasing in number.

"I feel like we might have just killed every single beast on this planet." Earl Ronsten stated, and it really did seem that way, as finally, after a claw hand had gone through a beast's head, the last one in the area had fallen. The only one that was still alive was the beast Jesk who had been helping them out the whole time.

As if to signify their victory, Jesk started to pound on his chest with all of his arms and roared as loud as he could. The question was, what do they do next. Most boarded the ship, while others stayed outside to protect it. They were being watchdogs in case there were any more beasts in the area.

The last thing they wanted to happen was the engine get destroyed just after the engineers had repaired it. Now, all the viscounts and Earl Ronsten was looking at Quinn, who sat in the middle of the ship's command centre.

"And… he's just been like this the whole time?" Viscount Norvic asked.

"No, there were a few times when I came in here, and he was shrieking with pain. I could see it; his body was changing going through something. I don't know what, but my guess is it's something to do with the nest Crystal." Ronsten replied. "The thing is, the glow around, and the energy is greatly diluted. Whatever he was doing, it's finally closing to an end."

With this, the group had made the decision. It was time for them to head back to the vampire settlement. They doubted that just movement of the ship would disturb Quinn, and the vampires were bound to be attacked by now.

Besides, if Quinn wanted a way to go back to the others quickly, he always had his shadow, but there was one thing on which others had no confusion about...he was almost done with whatever he came here for.

——

On the Daisy Planet, the battle continued, and with the leaders now joining the fray, it looked like the vampires were finally getting the Dalki upper hand. However, there was a problem. Of course, just like with every Dalki, the more they were injured, the stronger they got and the more they would fight back.

In the first place, they had sent out most of the best fighters among the vampires for the war, so they had lost a good amount of their forces. On top of that, they themselves were pretty exhausted. By continuously fighting, using their blood powers and abilities, they had pushed their bodies to the limit once already, and they were doing it again now, exponentially increasing the risk of draining out.

Although they tried their best not to show it, it was clear something was going on. Then, though, the strangest thing had happened.

The humanoid Dalki turned around and started to run back, and in the next instant, the rest of the Dalki followed. They were running back towards the ship.

"What should we do? Should we follow and attack? We have the advantage." Silver asked.

"No," Lee shook his head. "It could be a trap with stronger forces or maybe even self-destruction of the ship. It's not a good idea to follow. Also, we need to recover and gather the vampires' bodies who have sacrificed their lives in this battle.

Looking around, that's when Silver noticed that the leaders themselves were exhausted. It was the first skirmish, and it looked like they had killed around a third of the Daliki forces, while the vampires' attack force had also taken around the same, percentage-wise.

A moment later, a ship they recognised appeared from behind had begun to land. Descending from the ship were Sam and Vincent, along with them were reinforcements. Since the humans of the Cursed faction were sent away, there were only the group of fifty or so vampires from the tenth family as reinforcements.

As the two got out of the ship, the leaders and others were quick to greet Sam. Seeing them some of the vampires were concerned because not seeing thier leaders arrive with the others, they thought that maybe they would have come with Sam.

"I don't see the first family leader anywhere? Where is Nicu?" A Vampire asked.

"Now is not the time for that!" Sam shouted, and along with Vincent, he quickly rushed to get out to the field where the rest of the leaders were. All of them stared at the Dalki mothership off in the distance.

"What's wrong..what's with that look on your face?" Silver asked.

Both Vincent and Sam could see the Humanoid Dalki smiling near the Dalki ship, and they knew why.

"Everyone, prepare yourselves for battle any second now. Inform all of the vampires behind the walls - Fight for your lives!" Sam screamed at the top of his voice, leaving the vampires just to wonder what he was so concerned about.

"It looks like they are finally ready." The Humanoid Dalki smiled.

*****

# Chapter 1554 - Dalki Trump Card (Part 2)

Adapting to the situation would be what best described what the Dalki were doing at the moment. Sam was right, Graham never knew that they had planned to attack so soon and if they had done it a little sooner, the Dalki leader would have been unable to prepare the New Gen Dalki of mostly three to four spikes and the humanoid Dalki.

The combined power of the vampires and the humans was a development outside his predictions. Which is why even though the New Gen Dalki was ready, something else that Graham had planned was not.

When Logan looked at the files in Graham's server he had found another experiment. Although this one had been going on for a while it was yet to be complete. However, the most surprising thing was the fact that the location of the experiment had been moved itself.

From the main lab that was on the Dalki home planet, to one of the motherships. It was as if Graham expected them to get as far to their home planet. At least this was how Sam interpreted the action, but it was something much simpler than that.

Quinn had given Graham a challenge, stating that the vampire settlement couldn't be taken over, and the Dalki leader was willing to prove him wrong. The current experiment was on the very last Dalki ship that had headed over to the Daisy planet.

———

A little before Sam and the others had arrived, two people were in the middle of a debate, although one person seemed to have already won, since the ship was heading towards the vampire settlement already.

"We have to report on this!" Bonny shouted at Void.

After filming Sunny, Bonny and Void had relocated to one of the Earthborn faction planets. They had also filmed Longblade and the rest of the vampires reclaim the planet they were currently on.

One of the reasons they had chosen to move to this planet was to show the relation between the vampires and humans.

Unfortunately, that is where the filming had also stopped. Sam had told the reporter duo that going into the Dalki part of the beast planet solar system was too dangerous. The lives of their own people could not be guaranteed, much less that of two more civilians. Seeing how insistent he had been, Void had taken it upon himself to convince her.

The duo kept receiving good news after good news, but weren't really able to give full updates on the entire situation. This of course caused quite a bit of backlash from the online community. Asking them to film the battles like they had been doing.

The soldiers were risking their lives, and the civilians demanded to see what was happening. All of them were already praying for the success of humanity, yet getting kept in the dark was making all of them anxious. Bonny could sympathise, since they were just as blind without the occasional update.

In the end though, something like a calling had appeared. The Dalki were now attacking the human part of the Beast solar system. It was close by, not too far away, and on top of that this was the last Dalki mother ship.

Bonny felt like the people deserved to know, which was why she was already on the move as soon as she knew what was going on. There was still one question on her mind, as well as that of many others, especially from the Cursed faction.

Where was Quinn?

"Don't you think we have tempted fate too many times? Besides most of those there are vampires!" Void shouted back. "We should just go back to the others and wait for the good news."

"Are you crazy, this could be the final fight! The fight which decides humanity's fate! It's on our part of the galaxy, so no matter what we are going!"

Void knew that his protest was in vain, after all the ship had already taken off. Still, he just wanted to share his frustration. After this, he had decided himself. If this really was the final fight, then he would hang up his filming days and retire.

Eventually the ship had arrived, and the special drones they would use had appeared as well. They had caught the tail end of the retreating Dalki, which was a weird sight to behold.

"Oh…is the fight already over? It looks like we might have had some luck!" Void commented with a wide smile as he continued to film the whole thing. He was so used to it by now, that it was almost an automatic response for him.

"No, look at the film and zoom into that one's face!" Bonny shouted, still excited.

The live stream had already started, and it was the first time the public were being shown a humanoid Dalki, but the camera was able to catch what Bonny had seen perfectly.

"What is that? Is it a mix of a human and a Dalki, a Humalki?"

"That's a stupid name… and you shouldn't make it sound cute in the first place. Look how all the other Dalki are taking orders from it. It's clearly the leader, which means he could kill your arse and all of our arses any second."

"There's something that's giving me goosebumps looking at the thing as well…can you see it smiling for some reason."

————

The humanoid Dalki along with the others had retreated, because they could tell that it was ready, what they needed more than anything was more time. While the vampire leaders were preparing for what was to come, Sam was doing something else.

He had activated his Dalki energy reading device, just to confirm the group's worst fears.

"How bad is it?" Chucky asked.

Sam was on the wall of the fortress, while Vincent had gone down to join the others out front. The vampires that were injured or dead had been moved inside as they were taken in. The good thing was the group were allowed to recognise themselves.

Around two hundred strong vampires were present, gargoyles still alive with crystals of a high tier powering them. Going up against the army of seventy or so Dalki, but there was more…

"The energy reading, if we don't include what was already here, it's three times higher than the other planets." Sam explained. "It's worse than I thought."

The hatch of the Dalki mothership slowly started to open up, and walking out three Dalki could be seen, and around the world the reactions of seeing these three were dreadful.

Not only were the civilians watching the broadcast of the battle that was about to take place, but all of those that had just survived their own battles. Those that had fought in the war so far, couldn't believe it.

"How…are we meant to win this fight?" Samantha asked, and the others felt the same way.

"We have to go, we can't just sit around and wait to see what happens, even if we are exhausted." Mona said, who was with Samantha on one of the Earthborn planets.

"Get the ship ready, we're heading for the vampire settlement!" Owen shouted after seeing the three.

"Sir, you can't, you still haven't recovered and can barely move. Do you really think being there will make a difference?"

"If we don't win this battle we have lost the war, don't you understand that? Get me a ship and take me there now." Owen demanded.

The reaction from everyone in the world wasn't an overreaction at all, because of three Dalki they could see.

The one on the right figure was slightly leaner than the other Dalki, still it looked more normal than the others. It had a resemblance to one of those they had seen before, but this one had two horns.

Then there was another Dalki, with a snout larger than others, and fists that were able to carry more energy, standing to the right. Finally, in the centre, there was a Dalki with an abnormally large tail. One that would swing almost left to right as they walked out.

Each of these had five spikes on their back, but that wasn't the worrying part at all. It was the fact that in some way, they had some type of resemblance to the Dalki leaders. One Horn, Slicer and Green Horn.

"We killed them before… we just have to do it again." Vincent said to himself.

Hearing what Vincent said, standing on top of the tower Sam replied.

"Yeah…but last time they were all apart, this time there together… and some of the people that killed them are dead."

*****

# Chapter 1555 - Fight For The World

Looking through the information that Logan had sent to Sam, the tactician was aware that those weren't exactly One Horn, Slicer and Green Horn. These three leaders had already died, and there should be no way to clone them.

And indeed, Graham had done something else. Through countless testing he had attempted to find the DNA that had been used to create them. The unique DNA structure that had been infused with the Demon tier beast to create the strongest Dalki in existence.

There was a problem though, even after mixing two different sets of DNA, he had been unable to create an exact replica. It was similar to two parents having a child. Although the parents didn't change, a new child would never be quite the same as any previous ones, or subsequent ones.

Still, it wasn't as if his 'failures' had been useless. Many of the three and four spikes of the New Gen Dalki had been created thanks to Graham's desire to recreate ones that could match up in power to him.

This process killed two birds with one stone. Graham could create countless Dalki to fight against, hoping to improve himself, while trying to find those that would be as close to a match as possible.

Eventually he had succeeded… at least somewhat. Even New Gen Slicer and New Gen One Horn hadn't been born as five spikes. Improvements had been made on Graham's special healing device. One of them would break down the body, attacking it constantly while monitoring the Dalki.

Once it was on the brink of death, the container would start healing them again. This process repeated over and over. It didn't work so well on Graham, he knew he needed something else to evolve, but for the others it had worked perfectly.

Now, Dalki were walking out on the field that resembled One Horn, Slicer and Green Horn, and all three of them shared the traits of their originals.

"Leaders, we need to take out those three as quickly as we can, do you understand?!" Vincent shouted to all those on the ground. "Don't hold anything back. Treat them as monsters on the level of Laxmus!"

They all roared back in response. The next second, the Dalki army charged back in, the Humanoid Dalki from before still taking the lead. The three five spike leaders though were walking over carelessly, and just seeing this was putting so much pressure on Sam.

'Think… think.' Sam thought as he looked around him. The vampires were in the settlement, worrying, watching the broadcast that Bonny was currently showing. The walls were too high for them to see anything that was happening on the other side.

The vampires could join the fight, but would it really help them all that much? In the end, the only thing Sam could do was send an update to everyone on the situation, including to those still on the Dalki planet, as well as to Quinn.

"Everyone!" Sam shouted behind him. "This is a fight for our lives. If we win here, the war is OVER!!!"

Leaping off the wall, Sam also joined the fight.

Just like before, once the Dalki got within range, the towers started to activate and the Gargoyles joined in the fight as well. Seeing all of this, Vincent went to run past the carnage that was taking place to deal with the three behind him.

That was until the Humanoid Dalki jumped in his way. The two of them threw their fists and clashed in the centre. Vincent's strength had won out of course, pushing the Dalki back, but they were clearly annoying.

"Damn it, get out of my way!" Vincent shouted, activating his blood powers, but more Dalki were upon him as well. He was wondering what happened and where the other vampires were.

What the tenth leader was unaware of, since he and Sam had just arrived, was that the vampires were exhausted. The same was true for the leaders as well who had little use of their abilities left. They could no longer use their inner blood weapons because they had already fought before.

'After I take on this Humanoid Dalki. I'll just have to kill the other three myself.' Vincent told himself, even though he felt like it was impossible. He still had no powers, only blood aura, no Demon tier weapon either. Taking on a single one of the New Gen Dalki leaders, he might be able to fight them to a standstill… but he wasn't sure he could win… never mind three.

It was then that New Gen Green Horn's fists started to glow. They glowed with some strange energy. Watching the tower fire off, it blasted into the field of fighting. Seeing this, Green Horn threw his own fist of energy. It went right for the tower and the second it had hit the top, it exploded, crumbling it to pieces, causing it to fall.

The video footage being filmed showed the destructive power of the New Gen five spike leaders. In the middle of the battlefield itself, the Gargoyles were putting up quite the good fight, that was until New Gen Slicer swung her tail, bisecting their bodies.

They were a simple thing to cut, and eventually the crystal itself had been destroyed as well. The defences that had been built up by their King started to go down one by one. The extra defences that made them feel invincible were crumbling to the ground.

Lastly, one of the Dalki leaders started to grow in size. It grew larger and larger. A Dalki that was large enough to perhaps destroy the battlefield, though that wasn't New Gen One Horn's intention at all. He walked past all the fighting, and went directly up to the wall.

"This is your unbreakable fortress?" One Horn chuckled, as he readied his arm and threw out a punch. Hitting it, with such a force, the whole battlefield was shaking. Surprisingly, the wall managed to endure it.

Unfortunately, the giant Dalki simply continued to punch the wall, shaking the entire place. As durable as it might be, cracks were starting to appear, and it was only a matter of time until it fell.

The look on the vampire faces showed fear for the first time, as they saw a giant Dalki head towering over the wall, continuing to punch it again and again.

"No!" Sam shouted. Using his Shadow to travel away, blocking whatever stray attacks hit him. Eventually running through One Hour's legs and going through the wall, Sam had reached the other side.

"This is it." The viewers were saying. "If the vampires can't even defeat the Dalki… then how are we supposed to?"

As that was said, though, there were many people seen leaving the tenth castle, coming out. At the same time, as the ship was seen approaching, Green Horn fired off an energy blast towards it. Before it was hit, there were those that came shutting down like a rain of lightning hitting the ground.

It wasn't just Owen, but also Grim, the other members of the Blade family, Samantha and Mona.

From the tenth castle, those that had arrived were those that had just come back from the main Dalki base, their homeland. Logan, the Blade family, Layla, Jake from the vampire leaders.

Everyone had arrived.

"They all came back! That means the mission was a success! Right?!" Void shouted, feeling over the moon. Thinking that maybe they still had a chance. These were the people that had defeated them before, but Bonny wasn't so sure.

When zooming in, the camera closer to them, she could see the look on their faces. None of them displayed any confidence in this herculean task, and judging by the incoming mass of comments, the viewers could tell the same thing as well.

"I'm sorry." Sam said, standing in front of them.

All the vampires had escaped to their respective castles, while others had gone to join the battle that was going on outside.

"I can tell all of you are exhausted. You already fought with everything you had already…but if we don't get rid of these guys then they will kill us all. I'm sorry, but the world needs your strength one more time!" Sam shouted.

The others didn't say anything because they knew what they needed to do.

"Damn it… after this is over I demand a nice and long vacation… no, make it a honeymoon, paid with all expenses!" Fex complained, looking at the new One Horn in front of him.

One more large punch was made, and this time, the Dalki's hand pierced through. The next moment, the wall crumbled to pieces, and now they all could see One Horn once again. Just as everyone was ready to use every bit of strength in their body, there was a voice.

"I'm sorry… I'm sorry I took so long. You can all rest now."

*****

# Chapter 1556 - Syncing
The two ships had left from the swampy planet, and onboard one of them was Quinn and the original crew that had come with him. Jesk the gorilla-like beast, was also moving along with them but chose to stay on the far end of the ship.

The others guessed that it was due to whatever Quinn was doing because even now, he was still going through the steps. Ronsten, who had been keeping an eye on him, knew that Quinn was most likely in the final stages. The energy previously surrounding Quinn was no longer present, but instead, Quinn himself was the one that was bursting with energy.

"We just went through the space station and are now heading towards the vampire settlement, and he's still like that? We can't join the fight if he remains in this state." Viscount Norvic said.

The Earl agreed. In the worst case, they would have to hover around the planet until Quinn was done because they had no clue what he was doing right now or whether any interruption would disturb him.

Because of this, the group agreed to wait patiently while the fifth family continued going forward. They had reached the outside of the planet, and Quinn still wasn't done with whatever it was that he was doing.

Eventually, all the vampires started to watch the broadcast shown in the settlement. It fueled their bodies with anger, and they were wondering what to do.

"We have to go help!" Norvic shouted once he saw the large three appear.

Earl tightened his fist and struggled to decide what to do, but when he turned around, he suddenly noticed that Quinn had stood up and was looking at his own arms as if they were foreign to him.

[100 per cent of the Crystal has been absorbed]

[System is In the process of being upgraded]

[..]

There were multiple messages in front of Quinn, but before he checked them all out, he wanted to know if Ray was back.

'Ray...are you there?' Quinn asked.

There was silence; it was a long shot, but he was hoping since Ray was in the system, with all the power he had absorbed, maybe it had brought a small part of the latter back.

'I am...but don't focus on me...look at the screen, you idiot. Your people, they need you right now.' Ray replied.

Looking at the screen that was in the room with them, Quinn could see exactly what was going on.

"Please update me on the situation," Quinn asked.

He didn't have time to check the system's messages as Ronsten began to relay all the information about what had transpired in the war; at the same time, Norvick was already moving the ship towards the vampire settlement as fast as possible.

First, Quinn needed to know which planet needed the most help where he should use his shadow travel. Only to find out that all of the fights had ended. He had no clue how much time had passed while he was away, and Quinn couldn't imagine the chaos.

Then, seeing the ship approaching the settlement, before saying anything else, he used his shadow travel to sink through the walls and leapt down to where the others were. Before touching the ground, Quinn allowed for his shadow to hit the floor first, making his landing soft at the same time no one had seen him arrive.

Quinn walked behind as he looked at the trouble in front of him and could see the others ahead, he could feel how tired and exhausted they were and on top of that hear Fex's words. Finally, the shelter wall crumbled.

——

"I'm sorry...I'm sorry I took so long. You can all rest."

Turning around, they saw Quinn in his blue fang armour set; the others didn't even know when he got there, but still, with what was in front of them, with what they had to face, they weren't even sure if Quinn could help them out of this one.

They wanted to cheer, ask Quinn what was happening, but each of them needed to focus on the fight in front of them.

Two cameras were currently filming, one aimed at Quinn and the other aimed at the new One Horn, who had just finished crushing the wall.

[Nitro acceleration activated.]

The next second, everyone saw Quinn disappear all of a sudden, and before anyone could react, he was directly in front of One Horn, throwing a fist out right towards the latter's head.

"No one is going to take over this settlement ever again!" Quinn screamed.

The fist soon turned into a large blood drill mixed with Qi energy. The speed that Quinn had moved at made him look like he had teleported from one area to the next. Before One Horn could even react, the blood drill exploded through his head, leaving a large gaping hole.

The five spiked Dalki's hard scales were useless, and its body slowly started to fall down. When it eventually hit the ground though, it was different to before. The whole area was covered in a black substance, that was because Quinn had already made his move out onto the field, utilising his shadow powers.

'Not a single one of you will escape.'

The other ships had landed with the rest, with Samantha and Owen coming out as they needed help but the first thing they witnessed was Quinn's show of strength.

"Did he just...kill One Horn...the thing we struggled to take out that whole time... in just one punch? but how?" Fex expressed his amazement.

The whole group rushed out to the hole in the wall to see what was happening outside. What they didn't know was Quinn had upgraded his armour set to the Demi-god level, making him faster than he was ever before. That, and with an upgraded gauntlet as well as the nest Crystal - all these things counted together, Quinn had improved a lot since the last time others had seen him. Still, they didn't realise that it was just the tip of his strength at the moment.

When heading out, they witnessed Quinn dealing with the Dalki, as if the latter were moving in slow motion, and Quinn was going to each one of them and punching under their chin, blasting their heads off.

Running forward, he threw a powerful kick, which sent one of the dalki flying back crashing into the others. A loud bang was heard as he threw out the kick and the air broke around him. Then, he would move on to the next Dalki closest to him. Each time Quinn moved from one Dalki to the next, a bang was heard as if Quinn was breaking the speed barrier moving to each one.

These weren't just regular Dalki; they were all three and four spiked Dalki that Quinn was dealing with, without even getting a scratch on him.

However, the real threats eventually started to get involved as Slicer began heading his way. She lept in the air spinning with her tail.

'I remember...when it felt like I could do nothing against you.' Quinn thought while a shadow rose from his hand, and he unleashed Arthur's sword. Running forward, he sliced right through Slicer's tail, chopping it off and making it fall on the ground underneath.

At the same time, Green Horn had fired two energy blasts towards him, but quickly spinning around, Quinn swung his sword, and a large explosion went off, destroying the energy blasts there and then.

Once again, Quinn charged in towards Slicer, who had regrown her tail, but Quinn slashed it off again before constantly hitting her across her body. Light scratches appeared all over, but they eventually got deeper and deeper.

While fighting Slicer, more of the strange energy blasts came his way, and quickly, Quinn had kicked Slicer in the head, not able to knock it off but smashing her bottom teeth, before turning around and casting his shadow and absorbing the energy blasts.

The energy blasts then rose through the ground, hitting other Dalki and killing them on the spot. When spinning back, he soon grabbed Slicer's head and held it there in place.

Her body was bloody from the wounds blood dripping from her mouth, it was clear that she didn't stand a chance, and Quinn was almost toying with her. The Dalki did become stronger after getting injured, but there is a limit to it, and it was the same Slicer because now, she had lost too much blood to make a swift recovery or a comeback.

"There's a reason why I kept you alive," Quinn said as he activated his new Demon tier weapon and started to use the energy drain active skill on Slicer—taking her energy and adding it to his.

"Is it just me...or is Quinn getting faster," Sil mentioned.

After having drained all the energy he could from Slicer, Quinn threw his fist right through her chest, activating the blood drill and piercing her body, which killed her on the spot.

Now only a few Dalki remained - Green Horn, the humanoid Dalki and around twenty odd survivors.

[System is currently syncing - 22 per cent]

The others noticed that Quinn had gotten stronger and improved after absorbing the nest crystal energy into himself, and they were right. Now, it looked like it was syncing with his body, enhancing his strength with every passing moment.

*****

# Chapter 1557 - The War Over?

There was a brief pause by Quinn after taking out Slicer. Once again, he looked at his hands; everything felt strange to him as he got stronger by the second. On top of that, even after absorbing Slicer, his body felt even more…powerful.

'That nest crystal…it changed my body.' Quinn thought. 'No, it's still changing my body.'

[System is currently syncing 34 percent]

As the percentage went up, Quinn's whole body was reacting to it; not only that, but he could see his natural base stats were improving along with it as well. Checking the notifications after absorbing the nest Crystal, Quinn noticed there wasn't much.

In fact, it would have seemed like a disappointment, but now he understood, the process wasn't complete yet. There was still more to come.

'I wonder what my body will be able to do at a hundred percent?'

The cameras were able to catch glimpses of what had occurred, but mostly all they could see was that Quinn had defeated several Dalki. Especially the large one who had destroyed the large wall but was killed by just one punch from Quinn.

They all had seen the five spikes on its back, and they all also saw the fight with Slicer, another five spiked Dalki, who too wasn't a challenge in front of Quinn's newfound strength.

"That's the cursed faction leader, right? I mean, I only saw him for a second, but he was using shadow and blood powers, so that has to be him."

"I'm not going to lie, I have never been a fan of Quinn, but right now...it might be the only thing we have."

"Was he always this strong, though? I heard the big four and leaders struggled to take on a five spike. How did he make them look so easy….is that why he was out of the fight for so long?"

"Maybe he entered one of those hyperbolic time chambers?"

"Those things aren't real, man, but whatever the case, I just hope Quinn can get rid of all the Dalki."

For the first time between viewers with the arrival of Quinn, their views weren't split. Right now, with the whole world's fate was in his hands, they were just happy that he was on his side. The world had already lost too much.

Even those that were alive were primarily young teens, yet to even join the military academy. They all knew those in the war, and they weren't stupid. They knew many of their loved ones, and even their parents had already died, which is why all of them wanted the same thing:

"Kill them all, Quinn! Kill them all!"

Watching his fellow five Spike die so quickly, the new Green Horn stepped back a bit, and it was the same for the other surviving Dalki.

"How, how can this be possible? We are five spikes, the strongest the world has to offer. Who is this person?!" Green Horn shouted. Of course, being relatively a newborn, he knew very little about the enemy in front of him.

Banging his fists together, the energy on his hands started to glow brighter than before. He was ready to constantly fire off all the power he could as if his life depended on it. He looked at Quinn in front of him, but suddenly, everyone heard a bang, in the next second, a hand appeared in front of Green Horn's face, clenching its head.

"Where is he?!" Quinn shouted, lifting his body in the air with one hand and then smashing it on the ground.

The others tried to get close, but the shadow on the ground rippled outward like a wave. It didn't quite hurt them when it hit the others, but they could feel the energy coming out of the shadow itself.

It felt just as strong as Quinn, and this was because, with all the extra power he had, he was also able to spread it through his shadow as well. Before, using so much Qi that he had in the body this way would have been damaging to him, but his body had changed, and the nest crystal with his demon tier weapon was giving him more strength.

The glow around the Dalki's hands started to fade as Quinn's fingers pierced the head of the Dalki, the pressure cracked the skull, and blood was dripping down around the edges.

"Who are you talking about?!" The Dalki screamed as if it was begging for its life. Something that many hadn't witnessed before.

"I'm talking about Graham!" Quinn shouted again.

The ripples in the shadow continued, and all of the Dalki looked like they were jumping towards Quinn.

[Nitro acceleration has ended]

Seeing this message, Quinn changed to the king's blood armour at that moment.

"Then all of you are useless to me." Quinn's armour set began to light up, and the armour drained the blood from the Dalki.

The next second, the incoming Dalki reached Quinn, and a large red aura explosion went off. It exploded from where Quinn was at and went towards all of the others around him, hitting them all one by one.

"That's..the king's armour, but I've never seen it create that big of an explosion before," Jin commented.

"Is it because of his blood aura?" Jake wondered. "Is it that strong, or maybe the Dalki blood that was infused with the armour?"

When the red aura began to fade, Quinn had switched his armour set one more time. This time, he was now wearing Arthur's blood armour on his body. The Dalki, who were closest to him, had already perished in the previous explosion. As for the one that Quinn was holding, its body looked almost burnt, with some of his limbs becoming ash.

Looking around him at the injured Dalkis, he stomped his foot, and from the black ground, arms began to arise. They picked all the Dalki and hung them in the air.

"It's strong enough to pick up a Dalki?" Vorden was shocked. He remembered when Quinn had first discovered the shadow, and now the two of them could see what it could do. Although Quinn could use the hands this way, they were always so weak that Quinn never tried to do such things.

However, the shadow was being powered with Quinn's second stage Qi energy, giving it a more solid form. The scene was a little horrid. The dark shadow hands lifted the Dalki's bodies, and the whole scene looked similar to a field of trees in a black pool of water.

The next second, seeing them all, Quinn started to raise the green blood from his fallen enemies and began to shape the blood. He made countless swords from them, similar to how a certain old man had used the blood powers before.

"I can tell from the system…many of my leaders…they've died. They fought to the end, and it was all because I asked them to." Quinn swung his hand down, saying these words, and the swords went right through the Dalkis' neck, finishing off the rest of the remaining enemies.

The shadow on the ground started to return towards Quinn, absorbed through his feet as the ground slowly became visible. Looking towards the ship, Quinn gathered his hands, his armour activated, and blood started to form.

He condensed the blood into a ball of energy, and eventually, throwing his hands out, Quinn had produced something similar to the blood cannon. Only the strike was far more extensive and stronger. As it hit the ship, the ship exploded into pieces. This mothership was definitely no longer operational, and the same could be said for whatever was inside it as well.

"Did…did we just win this war?" Bonny said with excitement.

The group walked out of the broken wall in silence, the vampires looked throughout the battlefield but stayed away from the battlefield, and they saw their king just stand alone.

[62 percent of syncing is complete]

The vampires began to cheer behind him in joy, and this reaction was spread through to the viewers who were watching as well. Many people were even hugging each other out of happiness.

"NO!" Quinn suddenly shouted aloud, empowering his voice with Qi so the others could hear. "It's not over!"

Off in the distance on a hill, near the wreckage of the mothership, Quinn saw a Dalki in clothes, stare at everything in front of him.

Graham was here.

*****

# Chapter 1558 - Humans Or Vampires?

The Dalki ship was quite away from the vampire settlement walls, and there was a large terrain of meadows and flower fields that were mostly destroyed due to the fighting happening in between. Despite this great distance, Quinn could still shoot a cannon of blood aura to a great length, far enough in the distance to destroy the large mothership.

All the others were celebrating just seconds ago until Quinn shouted at them, reminding them the war wasn't over yet. They saw Quinn walk towards the wreckage of the mothership, getting further away from the settlement.

They couldn't understand why he was heading forward because all they could see was black smoke enveloping the whole site.

But then, Bonny and Void's drones followed Quinn and continued to film everything, and that's when they saw him - the figure that was behind the smoke.

He leapt through from the other side, quickly going through the smoke. As he did, the force from the jump pushed and cleared away the smoke; even the fire was put out simply from the impact of this jump, and finally, upon landing, it crushed the ground beneath its feet.

Now they could all clearly see. A Dalki wearing human clothing and currently wore a white shirt and simple black trousers. It certainly looked strange and out of place—something unseen by the others, but those from the Daisy faction who were watching, those that had been in the countless meetings that Sam would have, knew who this was. This was Graham, the most dangerous Dalki in existence. His description was detailed to them several times in the meetings before, and now, he was standing in front of them.

"He finally appeared, and only a little after Quinn," Sam said. "The last great threat from the Dalki. He arrived even later than Quinn; I bet he's surprised at how far we were able to come while he was away…"

"Well, that's good then. Quinn can kick his arse...but I'm a bit worried about something else." Fex frowned.

They all were worried about something else. They soon saw him and Quinn facing each other on the live stream. In Graham's hands right now were two bodies.

Being held by the head, covered in blood, in his left hand was Sunny, the fifth leader. The vampires gasped as they noticed who it was. Sunny was one of the leaders, loved by both political sides - for and against the vampires ruling or protecting the humans.

She had that effect on people, and to see her in this state like so…was devastating for them. However, since Quinn stood very close, he could tell that Sunny was still alive albeit her energy was weak.

Yet this wasn't the only problem because, on Graham's other hand, he clutched a small girl that looked to be perhaps only around six years old.

"Minny!" Ruby shouted at the top of her lungs. Turning his head, Sam moved and immediately grabbed her hand before she could run out any further. Ruby had come along with Sam in his journey so far, trying to find out where her daughter was, trying to find an answer, and now, they have finally found her daughter.

"That's your daughter.. isn't she? The one that Arthur was trying to protect. She was with Graham all along, but why?" Sam frowned.

"Let me go...I have to save her! Let me go!" Ruby continued to struggle and scream, but Sam's strength far outmatched hers as a vampire.

"Please..I can't imagine what you are going through right now, but the best person that has a chance of saving her right now is already out there. You have to leave it up to Quinn." Sam tried to calm her down.

Sam's words were true - if anyone could save her, it would be Quinn, but the question was could he save her. At that moment, Graham held Minny by her head. Though she wasn't covered in wounds like Sunny was, she wouldn't be able to free herself even if she struggled or did much.

And, with her head in Graham's grasp, he could crush it at any moment.

'Since he's holding onto both of them, I can't use the shadow lock unless I take all of them into the shadow; but with Graham being who he is, is there any need for him to use hostages? What's his goal?' Quinn wondered.

"Graham? That's your name, right!" Quinn shouted out. "We have defeated the Dalki. Other than a few strays, you are the only one left. You have lost this war; there is no need for you to use them as a hostage."

Graham started to laugh at Quinn's response.

"Ah Quinn, the Vampire King and leader of the Cursed faction," Graham replied. "You know, in all of the data that Jim showed us, your name never came up in the list of those who had the even the slightest chance of disrupting his or my plans, but now Jim is dead, and as for me, well as you say I'm the only one here, but that doesn't matter.

"If I defeat you and get the demon tier beast, I can always create more of my kind. You are the problem; you are the anomaly in our plans, if I get rid of you, then all is well, and everything can continue the way it was meant to be." Graham replied.

"Then just fight me, as you said, no one else can match up to you, right? I'm the problem, then just fight me and let those go. Whether they live or die doesn't matter, the only fight that matters is between you and me." Quinn said, hoping to convince Graham somehow. Seeing that he was wearing human clothing, Quinn assumed that this Dalki was a bit more human than the others.

However, after hearing Quinn's words, just a smile appeared on his face.

"You're right, but you see, I brought these two because I thought I could make things a little more interesting," Graham explained. "I know your story; a human turned vampire. Someone who rose to the top to get a high position with the humans and eventually became king of the vampires as well.

"The odds of that happening are quite impossible. You have achieved a great feat, and because of this, you were perhaps the only person who could convince the humans and vampires to join together. You know, I even watched a lot of your broadcasts."

Graham said, looking at the hovering drones. He knew they were there but chose to ignore them, so the Livestream could pick up everything the two of them were saying.

"Every time you would appear, when you made the announcement to the whole world about the vampires, there was always the question, are the vampires really on human's side? Better yet, they would always ask if Quinn was on the human's side.

"This is without them even knowing the truth, and I wonder how many of you out there know the truth? I've heard the broadcast describe us as aliens, but that's not right at all. The Vampires created us! That's right, the reason why we exist in the first place is that vampires were the ones that made us.

"The vampires aren't helping the humans out of kindness. No, they were the ones who screwed up in the first place, and now, the humans, who are in the middle of it all, are suffering the most as the collateral damage."

Since the drones were broadcasting everything, Bonny wondered if she should cut the Livestream right now. She knew how this would make others feel, but the truth was necessary, and the people needed to know what had happened.

"Don't try to turn us against each other," Quinn shouted. "You knew about vampires, you knew where they were, yet you decided to attack humans anyway, and I saw what you did to Helen? Did you do that just because vampires created you? What did she do to deserve a cruel death like that, so stop your bullshit right now, and let's finish this."

Once again, Graham started to laugh.

"Oh, don't worry, we will, but I'm more interested in you, Quinn. You, who always stands on both sides, I want to know whose side you are on, so choose." Graham lifted Sunny, and then Minny after. "You can only save one of them, and the other will be let free. Are you on the humans' side or with the vampires? Choose."

*****

# Chapter 1559 - I Choose...

Everything that Graham had said was heard loud and clear by the audience watching the Livestream, and now they knew that it was up to Quinn to decide the fate of the two people in Graham's grasp.

"He has to choose the human. I mean, she is only a child, right? That vampire is clearly an old woman."

"Do you really think he would? He's the king of the vampires, and if I remember correctly, that woman is one of their leaders. She's an important figure, but that girl…she's nobody. I hate to say it, but I think he might be better off picking the vampire."

"He could try to save them both, maybe this is too hard of a decision for him, and who knows, Graham might kill them both anyway."

"If he picks the vampire, then that means that when this whole crap is over, Quinn will always be on the vampire's side, not the humans. I don't care if that girl is a nobody; she's still a child."

"How many children have already died in this war? How many children have died in the past already? Do you think one more death really matters? The vampire protected us, she led the attack against the Dalki in the war, and now that little brat is just being used as a hostage, that kid is a waste of space."

Reading all the comments coming in, Bonny couldn't quite believe it. Just moments ago, while Quinn was fighting, they were all united. United and cheering Quinn on, but now Graham had caused a stir between everyone with just a few words.

"He's not just thinking about now; Graham's thinking about the future as well. He doesn't believe this will be the last fight and is still trying to pit us against each other." Bonny said.

Although Quinn had no clue what the world's reaction was at the moment, he had an idea since he knew it was all being filmed, and being put in this position, it was his job to make it clear to everyone and what action to take next.

"For me, the answer is simple," Quinn said out loud. "The vampires are protectors of Humans. We have lived in the shadows, minding our own business, and now that humans need us, we have decided to come forward.

"I'm sure that one of our family leaders will understand because I know she would have fought with her life on the line to save the child in the first place. So I choose to save the young girl." Quinn said, pointing.

Hearing this, a loud sob came from back in the settlement. Ruby was kneeling over in tears, thankful that her daughter was safe and sound, and those online were quite surprised by Quinn's decision. Most had never expected him to say this, and they were wondering if his words were true.

Were vampires human protectors and not this enemy they were made out to be?

"I see; well, that's your choice then," Graham said as he dropped Minny to the ground.

But in that second, Quinn raised his hand.

[Shadow lock]

Minny disappeared into the shadow, and just before Graham could squeeze Sunny's head.

[Summon]

Sunny also disappeared from Graham's grasp and appeared right by Quinn's side.

[Shadow lock]

Using the shadow lock again, Quinn also placed her in the shadow.

"I won't play your little game, Graham!" Quinn shouted. "I got stronger and stronger every day, just so I would never have to see any of them die again, so I chose neither!"

Quinn blasted off from his feet as he kicked the grounds beneath him. He readied his fist, creating a large drill of blood, and it continually swelled around his fist. At the same time, he mixed it with his Qi, creating a balance of blood and aura.

Seeing this for the first time, even for Quinn, something strange happened; the red blood drill had swirls of yellow energy mixing in and around it. Syncing up with the system and also taking the energy from the five spiked Dalki's had given him a boost in power.

"I see, so you seem to have chosen the third option," Graham said. "None of you will survive."

Graham looked at his fist for a second and stood there as Quinn came towards him. Then, Graham threw his own fist right towards Quinn at the right time.

When the two fist's collided, the blood drill energy had almost disappeared, and before Quinn knew it, Graham's fist slammed him with a powerful force, and his body went flying through the air. Blood dripped from his mouth, and his arm was mangled.

At the same time, the power of the punch seemed to have travelled, as it was breaking the very ground of the planet.

"Everyone move!" Sil shouted.

The vampires ran to the two sides of the settlements as the punch continued going forward. The energy slammed right through One Horn's body as if there was no resistance at all, and eventually, it had hit the King's Castle.

When it did, everyone heard a large bang, and the rumbling of the whole settlement continued as they witnessed the king's castle fall just like that in front of their eyes, and all of it happened from just a single punch of Graham.

"Everyone, take the ships and fly out of here. The ground isn't safe; the settlement isn't safe anymore!" Sam ordered.

After seeing what happened, some of the vampires agreed, while a few were hesitant.

"This is an order. Allow our king to fight on this planet without any worry." Jin shouted to them.

The vampire leaders and the Cursed leaders were going to stay on the ground. They were strong enough to avoid whatever strikes were to come this way, but they were worried that perhaps with the fight that was about to go on, the vampire's settlement wouldn't survive, no maybe the whole planet.

[Blood bank activated]

Quinn's arm began to heal, and now he knew from Graham's single punch that this wasn't a fight he could take the risk of holding back.

'The five spiked Dalki were so easy to deal with, and even the six spikes weren't this strong...could it be.'

While in the air and looking down, he could see that on Graham's back, there were, without a doubt, seven spikes.

"Do you see the number on his back…its seven spikes, a seven Spiked Dalki!"

"Quinn's body went flying from a single hit...is he even still alive?"

"Even if he is still alive, how can he win? How can he go up against that?"

Sam and the others on the ground had a similar feeling because they never imagined that Graham would have gotten this strong. Even Nate felt like he wouldn't survive if he blocked that attack with his shield in Quinn's place.

"Hahaha, I would like to thank you for giving me such a great feast by sending that woman from before. Thanks to you, I was able to get even stronger than before. Hopefully, I will grow even more once I eat you and everyone else. What's the limit of the Dalki body evolution...is it endless?" Graham wondered aloud with a big smile on his face.

Jumping from his position, Graham had destroyed the ground beneath and went to throw another fist towards Quinn.

"I'm sorry...for thinking I could beat you with just my bare hands!" Quinn shouted.

[Shadow Overload activated]

[Shadow body has been created]

A pair of shadow wings had formed on Quinn's back, and using them, he dashed forward towards Graham.

At the same time, Arthur's sword appeared in Quinn's hand. With the armour, it started to light up. Just as the two of them were about to collide, a shadow appeared right in front of Quinn and passing through it; he appeared directly behind Graham.

He then swung the sword, hitting Graham at the top of his head, causing mass explosions as the force sent the latter down, but Quinn wasn't going to stop there, as he flew with the sword aiming to pierce it right through Graham.

Just as he was about to reach the ground, though, Graham punched the sword on its side, knocking it out from Quinn's hand and skidding it across the ground. With his other hand, Graham then whacked Quinn on the shoulder and knocked him to the side as well. Graham;s punch was far quicker than the shadow.

Quinn's body went skidding across the ground side but not too far away as he quickly regained his composure. The shadow body is like having the shadow armour covering him at all times, but Quinn could still feel pain.

Something was up. Similar to Qi, Graham's hits could get through the shadow, causing him some pain, but it still had blocked most of its attack.

[70 percent of Nest Crystal has been synced.]

'With punches as strong as his, I have no clue how long this Shadow Overload skill will last, and I know this sounds crazy...but I think he's faster and stronger than me.' Quinn realised after having received two of Graham's punches.

To win this battle, he would have to rely on his skills and special powers.

[Soul weapon activated.]

[Twin tail chain]
