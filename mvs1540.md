# Chapter 1540 - The Cursed Leaders Back Again

Although it had been a while since Nate had discovered the main Dalki base, he wasn't instructed to step on the planet on his own; instead, he was called to another planet to change the type of ship they would be using for this battle.

Instead of the small combat ship, they would use one of the medium-sized vessels deployed in this area from the main Cursed ship.

Currently, he was waiting patiently, having moved away from the main Dalki ship.

For one, he was worried that if he stayed around too long, the enemy might dispatch forces to attack him. A space fight wasn't exactly in his best interest, and the Dalki ships were just as good if not better than those that earth had, which was why Humans preferred combat on the planets rather than in space.

At the same time, a large uncrewed drone ship was monitoring the planet. It was also being used to get an energy reading from the planet. Because of this, it didn't matter if Nate let it out of his sight or not.

While waiting at the given coordinates, the new ship finally came into sight, and he couldn't help but stare at it with stars in his eyes.

"Whoa…that's what we will be using…it looks so cool." It was a medium-sized vessel for a crew of around twenty-five at most. However, it was nothing like he had seen in the military designs before.

The front nose of the ship was quite pointed, while the top had a large living area with two curved apertures that looked like wings. It looked like it had the momentum of a combat ship, yet clearly wasn't the size of one, and Nate was correct with his guess.

This ship was one that Logan had specially made. Whenever he would have free time, he was always trying to come up with new inventions, and he knew that a fast, agile ship that could carry the main bulk of the Cursed leaders would be needed one day, which was exactly what he had made.

"Nate, thank you for waiting; please approach the ship now." A familiar voice said.

Following the instructions, Nate moved in no time.

——

Nate noticed that the inside was just as impressive as the outside upon boarding the ship. It reminded him of the feeling the first time he had entered the Big Bertha, which was now the Cursed ship created by the military.

Only, the design in this place suited more modern attics. It was streamlined smooth; hardly any edges or wires could be seen. It almost didn't feel like he was in a ship at all. Heading towards the ship's bridge, he soon ran into Logan and Layla.

He had been informed a bit about the plan and the good news, but not all the fine details that would be explained after everyone arrived.

"I'm glad to see the both of you are okay…we had a tough time on our end," Nate said, but as soon as he spoke these words, he could see that Layla wasn't exactly in the best of shapes.

Her arm had been reattached relatively easily, but she touched it as soon as Nate said that and had brought upon a wave of crashing memories.

"I'm sure we will all want to share our experiences, but let's wait until the rest of us arrive. We will discuss the plans once everyone comes and talk to each other about our battles."

Now, it was a waiting game for the group, but it didn't take long for the other groups to arrive since they had been on standby, waiting for the following instructions. The first to arrive was Peter, and along with him was the sixth vampire leader Jake Muscat. Other than him, Peter had his lesser Wights, though only bringing three with him in total this time: Legs, Headless Hilston and the Humanoid Dalki with the long claw-like hands.

Judging from the looks on everyone's faces, they were pretty surprised that Peter could use one of the Humanoid Dalki.

As Logan suggested, they kept the questions to themselves, for now, waiting for the others to arrive as well. The next group that was to reach was Linda and Fex, and lastly, the whole of the Blade family came. Vorden, Raten, Sil and Borden had all come together.

All of them were seated around a round table, where as usual, Logan would display a holographic screen talking about the plan before the group got into action.

"So the latest readings claim two things. First, the current force on the Main Dalki base planet is no more than the other forces we have fought against. Now, this doesn't mean it would a hundred per cent be the case; after all, there might be places that the device had missed, or perhaps the enemy has a way of creating more Dalki like the ones we have all faced - the new Gen Dalki.

"However, I would guess that it's unlikely. From my discussions with Sam...they probably didn't think we would get this far. But thanks to our power increase in addition to the vampires, most battles that we would have fought and lost had the opposite outcome. Also, using the demon tier device, we can confirm that the demon tier beast is still present as well.

"Our ship has a camouflage ability, making it nearly invisible and silent. It will take some time for us to land as the momentum is drastically decreased, but after that, the crystals will continue to power the ship's camouflage while we will head to the location of the demon tier beast's reading."

"This should be easy for us then," Peter said with his arms crossed. "We took out our enemy easily, and now it looks like the Cursed faction is back together again. Even if your little reader thing is half wrong, I think we can still deal with whatever is coming our way."

The others seemed to agree, at least the ones that had an easier time defeating the enemy.

"We haven't talked about it much, but on our planet, there was a five spike Humanoid Dalki," Layla mentioned. "I heard the rest of you went up against four spikes…there's a big difference in their power, and it might be the reason that Graham chose to freely leave this place instead of protecting the Demon tier beast."

"A five spike!?" Fex replied in shock. They had gotten the report of their success but not the details of what had happened. "We had a lot of trouble just against One Horn...I can't imagine."

"Well, this time, you have the Blades and us," Peter replied. "I know you guys struggled, and we struggled before too, but it won't be the same as before, and besides, Layla and the others somehow managed to defeat it, which means we can do the same. Right, Layla?"

When asking this question, Layla was a little silent. She didn't want to admit that their whole group actually had no chance against Helen Dalki, not yet anyway. She did imagine how the others would have faired, though.

"Well, just in case. I have some of the blood of One Horn with us, and it will give Jake and me a boost in strength before the fight." Fex explained. "The others, are they all returning to their bases and to the vampire shelter?"

"Yes," Logan replied. "Sam, the vampires, vampire leaders and the others that have helped so far will be returning to their Shelter. The news about Sunny, Nicu and the other leaders who have sacrificed themselves in this war isn't disclosed yet.

"As for Owen and Samantha, although they had victories, their forces won't be of any help anymore. They would just be dead weight or used as human meat shields if they joined the fight now. They are currently focused on recovering their strength and protecting their planets. To put it simply, they are out of this war, and they can no longer fight."

Listening to this, everyone knew that now, it was up to the vampire leaders and the Cursed faction to finish this war. One was going to defend against the final attack from the Dalki, while the other was going to give a final blow to the Dalki's on their main base.

Since the destination was set and it was time for them to head to the main Dalki base, everyone started to talk about the battles they had faced and shared their insights, thoughts and experiences. They discussed the sacrifice of the people they had lost so far, but there were two main things that others were paying attention to.

One of them was the fact that Erin had killed Nicu. Nate felt like everyone should know about this, especially the vampire settlement, and it was something he couldn't keep in anymore. The others, of course, believed what Nate was saying, and they now knew that if they were to come across her, they would be cautious.

On the other hand, Layla still hadn't talked about her own experience and instead let Logan tell the event's details. Too many unbelievable things seemed to be going on in the war, but at least they understood their position.

"So what about Quinn?" Vorden eventually asked. "I feel like...whether Graham fights us here or is at the vampire settlement, only he can go against him. What's he currently doing?"

# Chapter 1541 - Peaceful Dalki

The new ship travelled faster than the usual medium-sized vessels, which meant they wasted next to no time getting to the Dalki main ship's location, the place which their enemy called home. Looking out the window, they could see it did really look like a small planet.

What was most interesting about it wasn't just the shape of the thing, but the fact that it was made up of several different terrains. It was a spaceship that the Dalki had made using all of the other beast planets.

"When I look at this, I feel a bit sad for the Dalki," Logan said as they slowed down upon approaching the place. They turned the ship's camouflage system on as they slowly came to the planet, lowering the probability of alerting the enemy.

Logan had backed every bit of his family's technology and his own knowledge, including Richard's, to create this ship. After completing the trials, everyone was left with a weapon to help them in this battle.

Although it might have seemed like the reward was the Nest Crystal, to Logan, he felt more like it was the knowledge left behind by Richard for someone to take his place in all of this.

"What do you mean? The Dalki are trying to kill us; why would you feel sad for them?" Fex asked. "No offence Borden." He felt like he needed to mention since Borden was also a Dalki.

"Just think about it, can't you? The Dalki were created by vampires, but that place never felt like home to them. Earth is a place they hadn't been to before, so what did they do? Looking at this, it feels almost as if they tried to create their own home."

"That still doesn't change the fact that they are trying to kill us, again, no offence Borden," Fex added once again.

"It makes me wonder, why doesn't Borden want to kill us?" Vorden asked. "I mean, he's just like the Dalki and the humanoid Dalki that we have encountered."

Borden placed his finger on his chin as he thought about the answer himself.

"I don't even know the answer to that one." He finally replied. "When I first was born, I just wanted to find you, brother, but I do have an urge to keep fighting, but that goes for all creatures, not just humans. Still, I can suppress it."

"It was my first time." Logan suddenly said, which made the others strangely look at Logan, waiting for him to explain himself. "I think Borden mixing in with so little of the beast DNA compensated for using most of your structure Vorden…or Sil's structure, to be precise. Honestly, there are some things that even I can't explain with science.

"For instance, at the time, the mind that was occupying Sil's body was yours, Vorden, and the personality that Borden represents most out of all three of you is yours. In fact, I can say that he nearly doesn't have a trace of the other two.

"Yet, the body always had and always belonged to Sil? Honestly, it might just be that Vorden's nature is so good that it overcomes any Dalki desires, or just like any creation, when mixing a set of genes together and mashing things up, no person or Dalki, I should say in this instance, is the same. Let's think of Borden as a mutation. In fact, if we could study Borden more, we could try to find out what makes him different from the rest.

"When we know this factor, we could try changing the Dalki. However, to even try to do something like that, even if we did find a solution, we would have to capture them and modify them. Imagine trying to do that when we are already fighting for our lives." Logan explained

"Speaking of which," Little Borden said. "I only have one injection left. I know you made a lot for me when we had the Demon tier beast, but I was wondering if you had any more."

"Unfortunately, that is the last one. The demon tier beast that Quinn has can not be used anymore. Perhaps if we are successful in our goal or find something in their lab, we can do something."

The ship was ready to land in a forest-like region as the conversation ended. It looked for the most open area and scanned for any traces of life, but there weren't any signs of life on this side of the planet. After crushing a few trees, the ship landed, and everyone descended from the ship.

Looking back, they could see that the ship was practically invisible; it was amazing, and with the trees, it was nearly impossible to find it. Although one could still touch it, and if touched, a ripple around the ship would reveal its location.

"Don't worry; the ship is linked to inform me if it reads any signs of life coming within its range," Logan explained. "However, we have a long walk in front of us. All of the Dalki, just like the forces before, are focused on one location."

"I think it might have been that large black tower. I mean, that has to be a dead give-away that something is there, right?" Fex commented.

The rest nodded at this, and soon, it was time for them all to make their way over there. The group walked through the forest-like territory for a while, and up ahead, they noticed the surface changing into a strange hard black substance ground.

"Before we engage in combat, I would like to ask everyone a favour." Logan started to speak, following something on his wristwatch. He was seemingly looking at something, but the others couldn't really see.

"The Dalki have a lab here, and I would like to gather as much information from them as possible. So let's try to get all the Dalki out of the area. Deal with the Dalki first, and then try to handle the Demon tier beast. In fact, if we deal with all the Dalki here, then maybe we can just leave the Demon tier beast captive. They are sure to have it locked up somewhere." Logan asked.

"Why would you want to get information from the Dalki? We will be getting rid of them all away." Jake said and then received a look from small Borden, who was riding on Vorden's shoulder. "Sorry little guy, I keep forgetting."

"Destroying knowledge is something we must not do because it can help us in the future; besides, you guys keep talking about how strong you were. If it's true, then these forces should be easy for you."

"Haha, that sounds great!" Raten stated, punching his fists together. "Alright, then why don't we all have a friendly competition? Who can deal with the most Dalki while on here? I mean, I would win anyway, but maybe I should use one hand to give you guys an advantage."

Usually, the others weren't so much into competitions, especially with how serious the situation was, but Raten always managed to annoy them somehow.

"Are you so sure about that Raten? Is Sil included in this as well?" Vorden asked.

"Haha...I have a big advantage if that's the case." Peter said with his lesser Wights walking by his side.

"What is wrong with you guys!" Layla suddenly spoke up. Linda had been quiet all along as well. She was still affected by what happened in battle with One Horn, but she knew this conversation was just a way how the others were dealing with the pressure of the situation. For Layla, it was different.

"This is dangerous; we could all die, people are dying now, and there are even those attacking the Vampire settlement. Once they're done there, they will go for the other planets, and here you are taking all this as a game."

There was silence from most of them until Peter broke the ice.

"Calm down, are you on your period or something?" Peter replied. "Just because we know your weak arse isn't going to win, no need to complain about our fun. Stop spoiling it for us…."

At that moment, Peter's voice trailed off, and everyone paused and glanced at each other, because coming out from behind a rock…was Dalki.

*****

# Chapter 1542 - Creating A Big Bang

The reason why most of them had glanced at each other was that they thought that seeing the first Dalki was the sign for their little competition to start. They all looked at the Dalki like it was some prey, and at the same time, when it saw them, it opened its mouth wide, as if it was ready to attack.

The Dalki aren't the type of beings to run away in the first place, and it wasn't as if they knew or bothered learning the faces of the humans that they needed to be scared of.

"The first one's mine!" Peter shouted, almost charging forward but before anyone else had moved. There was already someone faster than him and had punched Dalki in the chest. The fist pushed through the Dalki's chest, and it died without knowing what had hit him.

"So you decided to go for a speed ability once again?" Fex questioned. "Damn, I really thought that you might have picked stronger abilities in case you went up against Graham. Since you know they didn't work last time, why didn't you pick some other abilities?"

"This ability…saves lives," Sil replied and went back to walk with the rest. "Also, that's one point to me."

Honestly, Fex was just complaining because he knew with all of these monsters in this group, he stood next to no chance of ever winning the competition. He just wasn't even in the same league, even though they would often call him on these events because he knew the Cursed people well, and his strong ability came in handy a lot.

It made him think if his ability was something else, would they even consider inviting him along? Still, Sil did think Fex had a point because it wasn't enough to beat Graham if they ran into him with the current set of abilities.

"The competition is a good idea. My abilities won't last for a long time, so we should get a move on." Sil reminded them.

"Agreed," Logan said. "Since we have already encountered the first Dalki, we must be close to the main base."

The group was treading lightly with their destination, the huge black tower, now in reach. Nate didn't know how to use Shadow travel, but he succeeded in spreading out his shadow on the ground, making their footsteps almost silent as they continued to walk.

Once again, the terrain changed, and now it looks more like a jungle. The ground was still black underneath, but there were plenty of trees, which was perfect for the group to conceal themselves. The others had spotted a few more Dalki, but raising his hand, Logan stopped others from going after them, at least until they were aware of the whole situation.

"I can hear something. It sounds like a ship's engine." Jake said.

Trusting the vampire's leader's ears, they decided to follow the direction of the sound and soon reached what looked like a launching pad, but not just any type; it was one where all the Dalki motherships that they had seen were.

There were several ships here, around four of them landed at present, and the sound of other Dalki making more, but not just Dalki, they also noticed the presence of vampires, and surprisingly, all of them looked the same.

"What the f*ck!" Nate almost shouted, but it just turned into a loud whisper. "That's Jim! That's all those clones from that island, do you remember? Come on, you guys, you have to remember."

The others knew all right.

"Just because the original might be dead doesn't mean they can't stop creating clones," Logan said.

"Wait a minute, why can't they clone Dalki then? Like they do the vampires. Can't they use those new nest crystals you found?" Nate asked.

Logan shook his head.

"I think it's something to do with a demon tier beast's energy. In the first place, a nest crystal can't produce a demon tier beast, and how they actually exist is something unknown. Perhaps a beast keeps evolving? An unnatural occurrence, but the beast made by a nest crystal is never that powerful to start with.

"Since the Dalki have the Demon tier energy in them, it's impossible to replicate. Anyway, speaking of the Demon tier beast, the reading seems to be coming from behind them, and if I am not wrong, the structure which I am sure we can all see is the lab we were discussing earlier."

Indeed, the others noticed the lab too; it wasn't too far away.

"The other reading, although there are a lot of Dalki here, most of the energy sources are coming from closer to where that tower is," Logan explained.

The tower wasn't too far off from where they were, and they could see it too, but it was perhaps a kilometre over in the other direction. Now the question was, what was the group to do.

"I have an idea. I know before we left the ship, we agreed it wasn't a good idea for us to split up." Logan said. "But in this case, it might be. You guys still want to have your competition, right? Then my suggestion is that the Blades, along with Nate and Fex, except for Borden, head towards the tower.

"He comes with us, and Linda and Layla will stay with me. You guys, I want you to make as big a bang as possible, and if there is any trouble at all, notify us immediately. If you can handle it, then go crazy. If you can't, we will come up with another plan.

"Honestly, if you guys can't handle it, I doubt we would be able to as well, which is why we need another plan to get rid of the Demon tier beast. The other group will head inside the lab." While saying this, he gave little Borden a wink.

There was another reason he wanted to head there inside with Borden.

To see if there was anything they could do about his state. According to Quinn, he had seen the technology they had, and if Jin's clone was still here, he felt confident he would find something that would help little Borden no longer be little anymore.

The others seemed to agree somewhat, apart from Fex, who wanted to go along with the girls, but both groups were already moving their own ways, leaving Fex just to shake his head.

'I wish I was with Samantha…anyway, I just need to get through this, and then I can spend the rest of my time with her.'

——

It didn't take long for Nate and the others to reach the front of the black tower, but they noticed something strange. While making their way there, they noticed that in front of the base was the ground caved inward, and there were several cracks in it as well. Eventually, they realised it wasn't natural for the land to be that way; what they were in was an enormous crater.

At first, they thought it was just part of the land layout, but now that they were by the edge that only just reached the black tower, they could tell it was a crater.

"Is that just me, or does that look like someone bombed the ground, or maybe...punched it?" Nate asked.

It certainly looked to be the case.

"Does that mean…whatever created that is here?" Fex asked.

Running out, Sil was first. He stood there, and a group of Dalki guarding outside the strange tower had spotted him.

"Either way…we will have to face whatever created that crater if they are here or not. We have to try and stop him. We can't just rely on Quinn all the time." Sil said as he picked up a stone and threw it towards the Dalki. The stone went through the Dalki's head in the next moment, killing it instantly.

The others redied themself as it sounded like more were soon coming.

———

Back where Logan and the others were, they were patiently waiting a few seconds later, and they could hear constant explosions go off in the distance, not too far away. The Dalki and the clones, noticing this, started to rush over while a few had stayed behind.

"Looks like they are causing quite the commotion over there. Let's go." Logan said.

*****

# Chapter 1543 - Inside The Dalki Base

Around Logan's left arm, there was a constant robotic casing. For the most part, this was because he covered up what his Dalki arm looked like. It didn't look too out of place for Logan because his whole suit was made up of strange nanomachinery, which he could break down to create different suits or use for unique circumstances like the current one.

The good thing was, Logan always had a set of supplies with him, and he had somewhat predicted that there would be vampires at the Dalki main base. One of his guesses was that Jim would be here, though he wasn't considering encountering this many.

Still, because of this, he had prepared a special spray with him that allowed him to blend in with other vampires. They would be picking up his special scent, and thus, he also sprayed it on Borden and Layla for safe measure. Subclasses carried a different and detectable scent, and as for Borden, Logan honestly had no idea, but there was no need to take risks.

They were using the special spiders, and thanks to the big distraction in the opposite direction, they managed to reach the special lab without any trouble. They had the perfect team with them. The spiders could spot hallways and more, alerting them if anyone came their way.

As for Little Borden, at a glance, most would choose to ignore him, so help the team get through small places, then there was Layla. Currently, the group had made it into the main lab and the locked doors weren't a problem for Logan with his powers. The only one who felt somewhat useless was Linda, but she was ready to help whenever needed.

"We need to get to this lab's server room or something similar. Although it might not have the information we need, it should have the layout of this place." Logan explained.

His spiders were busy searching the place, and they could see two Dalki coming their way down one of the hallways. They were in somewhat of a rush. Rising her hand, Layla started to float up a few rocks she had picked up from the outside.

She slowly moved it past their feet on the ground and then flung it as fast as she could, hitting the wall of that hallway in the opposite direction.

"Did you hear that… let's go; we need to check it out. I heard the attackers are humans, but there are only a few of them; there could be more!" The Dalki said as they rushed over.

Logan realised on this mission that the Dalki weren't exactly the brightest, and as they went around the place, they also noticed that all the vampire clones were being treated like slaves.

They were being pushed around without any regard and respect and were silenced whenever they tried to say anything. How the situation came to be would certainly be an interesting one, but first, Logan had another job to finish.

Heading into one of the rooms by the hallway, the team found themselves in some type of storage room. It had a mixture of chemicals in glass bottles, melted crystals and more.

'Judging by this, we should be close. Instead of walking around and getting caught, I should wait for my spiders to do the job. We are in a good enough location right now.'

Thinking about this, Logan began to guide the spiders to start the search, and it didn't take long for Logan to find what he was looking for. It wasn't the lab but a server room. That place might give them some basic information about where the Dragon and Graham's lab was.

"How are my brothers and the others doing?" Borden asked.

"They don't seem to be in trouble. I haven't gotten an update from them, but they said they would contact me only if there was some trouble. I am more concerned about trying to pinpoint the location of the Demon tier beast.

"The device that we were using before is getting readings from all over the place. My guess is they are using the Demon tier energy for several things, which is messing with the readings." Logan replied.

Using the same tactic that they had done before, they made their way to the server room. It was almost left unguarded, and honestly, Logan was quite surprised how few Dalki there were in the whole lab.

'Have they already consumed all of the beast's energy, or perhaps was Sam right in thinking that Graham is overconfident?'

Placing his hand on the server, Logan was ready to get whatever information he needed. As expected, the servers linked to the Demon tier beast weren't here and the same for Graham's lab, but it did reveal their location.

Unfortunately, the two of them were in opposite places in the lab. With the main centre in the way, they will have to decide which one to go to first. While looking through the server information, although it said nothing about the demon tier beast or Graham's research, it did have some other information.

'A breakout?' Logan thought. Looking into it a bit more, he had just uncovered some shocking information. 'It said here that there was an ability user here, who, along with Truedream, had escaped from this place!

'So Truedream really was alive after all...and he even managed to escape. Well, the Dalki are a bigger problem right now. It seems he's been gone for a while and hasn't done anything. Perhaps he is planning to stay out of this war?'

Glancing at Layla and then at Borden, Logan finally made a choice. For now, they would head to Graham's lab. He was still unsure what they would do with the Demon tier beast, and it might take a lot of time to defeat it anyway.

In the meantime, Logan wanted to see if he could do anything for Little Borden. The group rushed, following Logan, but he didn't say anything. This was the choice he had made. Eventually, they reached the lab and for once, came across another pair of guards. The pair stood firmly in front of the lab, and it didn't look like they could be distracted just with some noise, unlike the previous ones.

"They're both three spike Dalki…I won't be able to take them out without making some noise. Borden, if you used your injection and turned into a four spike, do you think you can beat them up quickly?" Logan asked.

Borden thought about it for a while. A four spike's strength was far greater than a three spike, but to defeat the enemy without making noise was a big concern.

"Hey," Layla called out. "I can do it."

It didn't cross Logan's mind to ask Layla. Because even though she had defeated the Dalki Helen, everything he had noticed about her seemed odd.

"Layla, I know what Peter said might have annoyed you, but it's too risky," Linda replied.

Logan looked at what was in Layla's hand. She was already holding the black sword by her side rather than the bow. Logan wondered since when did she start using this weapon.

"If you are sure you can do this, then go for it. Anyway, I don't think you would say anything if you didn't feel confident." Logan answered.

Nodding her head, Layla soon changed to her second form. She grew slighter taller, and the Horns on her head ported the most when she was in this form. Still, other than the fourth form, this was when she was at her fastest and had abilities more like that of a vampire, but the most noticeable thing was the flickering sword marking, pulsing like a heartbeat.

Layla squinted as she tried to ignore all the cries that went off in her head, and in the next second, she ran out. Her eyes had barely opened, but before the Dalki could even notice, her sword had already moved and sliced through the pair's necks, killing them on the spot.

The others, witnessing this, were speechless.

"Wow…maybe she should have joined the competition after all."

Borden smiled, but they suddenly saw Layla collapsing on the ground, right in front of the lab door.

*****

# Chapter 1544 - Getting An Upgrade!

The group outside in front of the large black tower didn't panic as they faced the Dalki. It looked like Logan's reading device was working correctly after all since there were around the same number of three to four spike Dalki that were at the other fortresses so far.

However, with the team, which consisted of many of the Cursed strongest, it was proving to be very little trouble. It was strange; never in their life would they think they would feel this way when fighting against the Dalki, treating it as some sort of competition.

Vorden was able to fly up high and slash out wind attacks from above, and then when needed, he would swoop down with his steel wings, dealing fatal blows to the enemy. Some Dalki even attempted to jump and latch onto him, but his clawed like feet were deathly strong and sharp.

If he managed to get a grip of any Dalki, they would find it near impossible to break free, not unless they wanted to kill the beast. After obtaining the crystals the vampires had kept, Vorden had used those crystals to evolve himself into a demon tier beast just like Raten.

His speed was deadly when he flew in a straight path using his wings. His wind powers were just as strong as a high-level wind ability user, and his body was just as strong as the Dalki he was facing.

At the same time, another Demon tier beast was causing a rampage, having created several sharp blades. Raten's strange mud-like substance also slowed down his opponents somewhat. Then calmingly walking on the ground, he would slice his enemies as if they were standing still.

Fex, who was down below, couldn't quite believe it. It was clear that Demon tier beasts were always a bigger worry than the Dalki. However, they never tried to take over earth, and the beasts didn't fight as a group. If two demon tier beasts found each other in the same territory, they would attempt to take each other out. It was something built-in to their nature.

'Man, if the humans ever had to go up against an army of demon tiers…that would be troubling.' Fex thought while standing at the back, with his hands by his side, not taking part in the battle. This was not because he didn't want to join and help; rather, it was just that there really was no reason for him to join.

Even Nate, who Fex always saw as someone below him, was doing fairly well due to the Demon tier shield he still had in his hand. Blocking hits left and right and blasting the Dalki away with twice the counter-power was sure to finish off nearly any of them.

Nate could also utilise it well since he could punch the shield himself to give it a blast of power here and there. The only problem with that was the power range coming from the shield.

Finally, there then was Sil, the one who, as expected, was performing the best among all of them. It was strange, but all Sil had been doing so far was picking up rocks from the ground and throwing them at the enemy. At times the force would be so strong that it would break before reaching its target.

Thankfully, Sil could use plenty of materials on the Dalki planet that withstood his throwing power, but each one that hit the Dalki pierced right through their body. If it hit the head or the heart area, the Dalki would die on the spot, as if a bullet went through them.

It was hard to tell whether this was a strength ability or something else, but Sil seemed very focused on his attacks.

In the tower itself, more Dalki were rushing down going towards the human's, but even they could see that what was currently going on was a slaughter fest. One of Jim's clones was also taking a peek out of the window inside the room.

"Two beasts, humans, vampires… It feels like everyone is going up against the Dalki. I guess Graham underestimated them after all." Jim said

"What do we do?" Another Dalki asked. It was a four spike whom Graham had left in charge in his absence, "We can't get in touch with Graham at the moment either. Something is jamming our devices!"

'So it looks like a great mind is here as well.' The clone thought.

"I have a suggestion. It's up to you whether you follow it or not, but if you choose not to, there's a good chance that all of us will die." Jim's clone smiled, thinking perhaps it could use this situation to his advantage.

———

Over in front of what the others believed to be Graham's lab, Layla had just collapsed. Immediately, the group rushed over, but it looked like she was still conscious. The first thing Linda did was lift her and place her on her back.

Then, she and Borden quickly moved the Dalki inside the lab while shutting the doors behind them.

"I'm okay, Linda. You can put me down…it's just a minor headache, that's all." Layla replied.

"I think it would be best that you don't use that sword too much if that's the drawback of using it. There are other ways we can deal with the Dalki." Logan said, but he wasn't looking at them. Instead, he looked out towards the lab and was surprised at what he could see.

There were large glass containers filled with liquid and more however that wasn't the surprising thing. All of the servers and other devices were smashed and destroyed.

"Why would he destroy his own lab and leave it like this?" Linda asked.

Seeing it, Logan could only laugh.

"It seems like he somewhat expected us to get this far and wanted to keep the information. Maybe, the old me would have been devastated to see this, but just hitting on these machines wouldn't stop me from extracting any information at all. That Dalki doesn't know who I am."

Placing his hand on the ground, Logan activated his soul weapon. Because of the information he had gathered before from the other server room, he knew the details of just what terminals were in this place and other necessary things. It was also all based on things he had seen upon getting information from Richard.

It looked like a lot of what Jim, Graham and Richard knew was most likely the same thing. Because of this, Logan could rebuild the entire room with his soul weapon. He broke down the machinery into finer, smaller spiders and began to restructure it again.

His skill wasn't like healing or reversing time; he was just fixing things and putting it back together. This was why when everything was complete, it was as if no one ever destroyed it in the first place.

"There might be some corrupted data here and there, but I think I'll manage." Logan smiled, placing his hand on the terminals and trying to uncover whatever he could.

The information was soon downloaded into his head. Now he was getting information on experiments that Graham had done so far, including about the humanoid beasts he had created.

The layout of this base showed that this place was linked to the Demon tier beast on the other side. Finally, after he downloaded everything, Logan had finished his work in this lab.

"Hahaha, the Dalki are searching for a way to get the ability to reproduce and live a long life. I now have all the information they want." Logan smiled. "Which means Borden...it's time for an upgrade. Hurry up! Hop into the glass container!

"It will take a long time to build a lab like this anywhere else. So, this is currently our best shot."

Borden didn't know what was happening but had trusted Logan before and would trust him now. A strange claw-like device came and picked up Borden, placing him in the glass container. Logan then turned it on, and the upgraded process would soon begin.

"How long is this going to take?" Linda asked.

"I'm not sure, perhaps an hour or so? Once Layla has recovered, I was going to tell you to look after this room. With what's happening outside, I doubt anyone would come in here while Layla and I go and check up on the Demon tier beast." Logan explained.

Layla was still a bit dizzy, but she was recovering very fast, so they should be able to move out soon.

Logan didn't tell them that he had found out something dire while going through the information in Graham's lab. The vampire settlement was in serious trouble, and he knew why Graham was so confident now.

# Chapter 1545 - Everyone Die

The group outside the black tower were doing very well in dealing with the Dalki. Still, even though this was the case, a thought flashed through Fex's mind as he watched everything.

'If I remember correctly, Logan said that the energy reading from this place was the same as the other places.' Fex thought. 'Yet so far, it appears that they are weaker than the other forces we have faced before. Which means that there should still be a humanoid Dalki.'

The battlefield was starting to get quiet as the number of enemies rushing out of the tower had lowered considerably. The dead bodies of the Dalki had piled up around the area, and the boys had ended their competition long ago.

The main reason was that there was already a clear winner among them all: Sil. Even though he didn't get directly involved much in the battle, but some time ago, he found a hard large rock-like substance not too far away, which he smashed with his bare fists, creating several smaller rocks for him to use, and throwing them, he dealt with the Dalki as soon as the latter stepped out of the tower.

"This is a bit unfair," Raten complained. "Sil had killed some of those that were stuck in my mud. As I contributed somewhat, I'm sure that should count as a half a point for me."

The next second, Vorden had landed right by Raten's side, who had somewhat stopped fighting as well. "I didn't expect you to be such a whining loser. Anyway, it's fine; it's a good thing that none of us was badly hurt in the first place."

Surprisingly, there was someone else too, who hadn't fought much and that was Peter; instead, he was busy walking through the battlefield, looking at all the Dalki that had been killed so far.

"All of these guys are useless!" Peter shouted, kicking one of the Dalki's bodies so hard it went flying off in the distance, "If Sil can kill them with a rock, then that means a five spike or more would be able to beat them. You would think that at their base, they would have something worth fighting!"

It was at that moment, at the very top of the shelter, a large object crashed out from the top. Parts of the tower began to fall, and the group quickly regathered themselves. They were in the crater, and the object that had landed in front of them was around ten metres away.

It looked like an uneven ball of a black mass as big as a van. Upon careful observation, they noticed it move slightly, and along its back, five spikes slowly protruded out.

Slowly breaking out of the strange ball, a large Dalki stood straight. Its forearms, shoulders and legs were twice the thickness of a regular Dalki.

"That doesn't look like a regular Dalki," Fex noted, which was obvious to all of them.

The Dalki itself was far broader, and its body structure was different in every way. It looked like a Dalki covered in thick armour that was two sizes too large for itself. The only thing was it wasn't armoured; they were just the scales of its body.

"This doesn't look like a humanoid Dalki," Vorden said. "Which means it's a regular five spike."

Hearing this, Peter just smiled because it was precisely what he was looking for.

Sil threw a stone from his hands towards the Dalki's chest like he had done on many others. It was fast and hit it perfectly, only to get crushed into pieces upon impact and not even making the Dalki flinch, much less force him back.

"This is what we needed. Last time, Slicer was too much for us; we needed the help of the other Blades and Quinn. This time, we have to show that we are strong enough to take out a five spike on our own!" Sil said.

The others were inclined to agree, ready for a fight.

———

Meanwhile, on the other side, before heading off to the Demon beast's location, Logan decided to inform Sam of what he had found out in Graham's lab.

"We are still making our way to the Settlement now. All of the leaders are there…but if what you say is true, even with us arriving, it still won't be enough. Although, I just checked the energy reading, and your worst-case scenario has yet to arrive." Sam replied, "For now, continue with the current plan. If the energy readings change, I will let you know."

Still, there was a considerable worry in Logan's mind. The only good thing was that they had their portable teleporter they could use, but Logan had created a wide range jammer for all teleporters so that the Dalki also couldn't suddenly appear here for backup.

Before they used the portable teleporter, they would have to finish their job here to head to the Daisy faction. Although they could go to the other battlefield once they finished their mission here, the question was, would they even be in the condition to fight?

'There are multiple options. Killing the Dragon will force it to go to its other half, which is currently in Quinn's shadow space, making it whole again. If that's the case, then there is a high chance it will wake up.

'But who knows how long that process will take. And whether or not the Dragon will go on a rampage is a different thing. We could stay here and protect the demon tier dragon until the battle is over, but others will most likely need our help.

For now, they needed more information, and because of that, Logan and Layla were heading to the other side of the lab, where Graham had held the Demon tier beast.

While walking through the lab, Layla and Logan noticed fewer workers around the place. Even Logan's spiders were unable to pick up anyone.

'The others must be doing an outstanding job.' Logan thought.

"We might have to fight the demon tier beast, right? It was already in a weakened state from the fight on Blade island, and now most of its energy is drained, so it should be at its weakest." Layla mentioned and no longer held the sword in her hand, but it was still by her side at all times.

"Yes, correct. However, remember that the Demon tier beast is still a Demon tier beast. We always were taught that the Humanoid Demon tiers were the strongest, but from what we have learned, we know that this Dragon is an exception to the rule. I'm just hoping that we can find a way where we won't have to have a direct confrontation with it." Logan replied.

As they got closer and closer to the other part of the lab, Logan noticed something from his spiders. The room where the Demon tier beast was held...was already open. So far, every room they had come across was securely shut by the Dalki, and this one should have been, but to their shock, it was open - it meant only one thing - someone had opened the gate and could be inside the room!

"We have to hurry!" Logan shouted, running forward, worried about what was about to happen.

Based on what his spiders were showing him, he recalled all of them to himself. The remarkable part of his suit was that it would break down when releasing the spiders.

"What's wrong? What did you see? " Layla asked.

"Get ready to fight; we have to stop them!" Logan shouted.

The door was up ahead, and they knew immediately they were in the right room. Upon reaching it they could see a giant rectangle container that held the Dragon in place. Countless large machines were injected into the Dragon, keeping it in a strange sedated state while continuously draining its energy.

Seeing the Dragon once again was a reminder of how fierce it was, and what frightened Layla most was that its eye was open, staring towards them.

"Layla, stop them!" Logan shouted.

On one side of the container, besides the control panel, was one of the Jim clones and two Dalki.

"Too late! If we are going to die anyway…why don't we all die together!'" Jim said, smashing down on one of the buttons, and soon all the strange machines linked to the Dragon began to come off one by one.

*****

# Chapter 1546 - The Strongest In The Group?




Soon after throwing the rock, Sil went in to perform his next move. He ran across the field, and when he got close, he switched from his speed ability to his strengthening ability. Since he could not reach Dalki's head, the only thing he could do was slam his fist into its stomach in front of him.

A loud bang resounded in the area and even blew the hair of the others a little. However, the Dalki didn't even flinch from where it was; instead, it stared down at Sil.

"I'm starting to wonder why the others were so scared of you," The five spike Dalki said as it lifted its hand and threw a punch at Sil, but with just a slight movement, Sil was able to avoid it with ease, and now that Dalki's head was a bit lowered, Sil moved again and whacked on its head.

This time, the head flung to the side a little, but turning back, the Dalki just smiled, and anticipating what it was going to do next, Sil took a few steps back.

'I knew that a five spike Dalki's scales were tougher than the four spikes but to this degree?' Vorden frowned while watching the fight. He and the others weren't nervous even though there was a five spike.

In the first place, their main task was to cause a distraction, and since Logan hadn't asked for help, they were sure he was okay for now. So instead, without anyone saying anything, they were almost taking it in turns, seeing who could defeat the five spike.

'Right now, I think Sil must have the foresight ability.' Vorden thought. 'Usually, it allows the user to see a whole two seconds ahead of what the enemy is about to do. But with his powers…I wonder how much time he can see ahead of the others? Speed, super strength, and foresight, that's three out of the six so far. I wonder how much he has been practising with this set of abilities. The foresight ability is tricky to use and fight with at the same time.

'This is also the problem with Sil. Depending on those around him, he can be insanely strong or sub-par to the point where he can't even hurt a five spike Dalki.'

The others knew that Sil had far more up his sleeve, but since it looked like his first few attempts were unsuccessful, Nate decided to step forward.

"Oh..so that's what you guys are doing?" Fex said, having figured out their plan. "Well, why don't you all have a minute each? I'll keep the time. We all have two goes each, apart from me, of course, and after two rounds each with that big blob, we will all go in together to finish it off."

"And what if one of us kills the five spike before we get a chance to act together?" Raten asked.

"Well, that's just part of the game. You either go in earlier and defeat the five spike winning the match. If you go in later; maybe the five spike is injured, and you're able to figure out a way to defeat it with the knowledge of witnessing the others fight. Since you said the game was unfair last time, this sounds fairer. Especially since Sil has already had his turn." Fex said, looking down the line and smiling at the rest, ensuring they agreed with his words.

"Fine...but I will go next," Raten said, with his arms crossed.

Nate was able to pick up what the others were saying with his vampire's ears, and it lit a fire in him. Recently with all those around him, Nate had been feeling a bit down, but he was someone who obsessed over learning the best form of martial arts and finding strong opponents to face.

In the end, though, he discovered there were people with potential far above him who could grow much more powerful than him. However, with the shield, Shadow powers and a vampire body - the things he had obtained from the Cursed faction - How could he not blame himself for not being like the other monsters?

If anything, he had just as much opportunity as the others to grow strong. Seeing the Dalki attempt to punch him twice, Nate quickly avoided the hit.

'I saw his movements against Sil, and he was a bit slow. With the beast weapon active and the shield, I should be able to do something.'

After dodging the first two hits, Nate himself charged forward, running as fast as possible and threw out a punch. The two fists would slam into each other head-on, but the Dalki's fist was four times the size of Nate's.

But just then, the shield that was attached around the other arm of Nate's disappeared. At the same time, the shadow enveloped his fist, and the shield suddenly appeared in front of him the next moment.

The Dalki's fist banged into the shield, and the whole impact was absorbed inside, and the shield began to glow in the next second.

"I imagine that damn Graham must have already informed everyone about this shield by now. But there are still ways to trick you guys." Nate smiled.

The shield exploded with power. The power of the punch should have been twice as much as the impact, and it was what Nate had used so far. But when the bright light settled, the five spike Dalki looked completely fine without a scratch on its scales.

"Hmm, it makes you wonder... is the impact from the shield weak, or is this Dalki's defence just too strong?" Vorden thought.

Seeing this level of explosion, it seemed like a bit of both were the correct answer. Nate could tell that its own attack was weak, which meant he could never use its own power against this Dalki. If that didn't pierce its hard shell, what else could he do?

Attempting to hit it with his bare hands a couple of times, Nate successfully landed some solid hits and had even produced a hit similar to the hammer strike to put some internal damage, but the Dalki seemed alright.

After that, Nate's time was up, and he went back to join the others. The next to enter the field was Raten.

"Damn it," Nate expressed out loud. "A demon tier weapon, and I couldn't do anything with how weak its attack was and how slow it was. It's almost as if this Dalki was created to stall us. I think you were right when you called it a big blob."

Observing Raten, Vorden wondered if he could see an opening, a chip in its armour as one would say, but so far, he didn't find anything. Apart from running away from the blob due to its sheer size.

"One Horn was big as well, right?" Vorden asked.

"Yeah, actually, he was even a lot bigger, faster and stronger, but this guy's skin seems harder than his," Fex explained.

Hearing that, Vorden was thankful that someone like One Horn wasn't left behind. Otherwise, they really would have more trouble, or maybe not since Sil was probably strong enough to face him.

While watching Raten fight, others noticed that he was having the same trouble as everyone else. His mud-made blade hands smashed on impact as it hit the hard scales of the Dalki.

There seemed to be nothing he could do, but in the next moment, Raten climbed on top of the Dalki's head and formed his hand into something as small and pointy as a needle. With it, he stabbed Dalki in the eye. Soon after, though, the Dalki grabbed Raten and slammed him into the floor.

A part of Raten's mud-like body broke but regrouped together when he landed.

"You bastard, hahaha...I'll poke both of your eyes out until you die and bleed to death!" Raten laughed.

"Time!" Fex stated, informing Raten that it was time for him to step back.

"Well, Vorden, Peter, it has to be one of you?" Fex asked and soon saw Peter walking forward and punching his fist into the palm of his other hand, with his lesser weights following him.

"It's time to show you guys that Sil isn't the strongest in this group." Peter smiled.

*****

# Chapter 1547 - Another White

Everyone there knew that Peter was strong. He always had been, but the reason why he had never seemed somewhat impressive to the others was perhaps because of Quinn, who would always outshine him.

There was always someone more powerful, faster and more skilful, which was why even Vorden was thinking about what to do when it was his turn.

Right now, on top of that, Sil had already thought about combining his abilities as well.

"You guys can stop thinking about your turns because you're not going to need it," Peter stated.

The first one to approach the Dalki from his lesser weights was the new addition to the group - the four spiked humanoid Dalki with the long claws. Of course, it wasn't as strong as a five spike, but it wasn't far off.

In a way, it looked like the Dalki was there to test the waters.

"It looks like you can raise the dead and have pitted a new-gen against me. I'll be quite happy to crush this fool!" the five spike said.

As with all the other fights so far, though, when the five spike Dalki swung its arms and more, it was slow, slow enough that the four spike was able to dodge them with ease. It got its claws ready and started to swing them at the Dalki's arm that the latter had attacked it with.

Others heard the clashes, but the claws couldn't scratch the hard skin just like all the other attacks.

'In a way, this five spike Dalki is not much of a threat because it doesn't really have a way of attacking properly. Perhaps it still has the strength of a five spike, so if it could grab onto one of us, we would be in trouble, but it doesn't appear like that is going to happen anytime soon.' Vorden thought as he continued to analyse the fight. 'That's probably why even though being a five spike, it wasn't even considered one of the leaders. Either that or Graham had some way to fast track the Dalki to evolving and had only recently created this blob.'

Continuing to watch the fight, the Humanoid Dalki, under Peter's control, tried to do something else. It avoided the punches and constantly attacked the enemy's chest right where its heart would be. Moving in and out, the humanoid dalki was fast, almost like a vampire.

However, the five spike looked unafraid, and why would it be when the humanoid Dalki's claws couldn't even pierce through its body. Still, Peter and the other two lesser weights had yet to join the fight.

"You know, these humanoid Dalki have a special trait just like the five spiked." Peter started to speak, which was unusual for him. "But the humanoid Dalki, their traits seem to be more impressive than the five spiked Dalki. I've already won this competition."

The others were wondering just what Peter was talking about, but turning their heads for the first time, they saw a cut on the five spike Dalki's chest. It wasn't deep, and it was only a flesh wound, but the Dalki was clearly bleeding.

At the same time, the humanoid Dalki's claws were burning a hot red. After using the Humanoid Dalki to fight a little bit, Peter had noticed that the more it struck against someone or when it was fighting, its claws would change colour, and this wasn't just for some coolness factor. They were getting stronger and sharper during the fight while also producing some strange heat.

The humanoid Dalki right now was the perfect opponent against the enemy. This continued, and the claws were scratching off more scales and making the five spike bleed more, but then something else happened.

For the first time, when the Dalki threw a punch, it had almost hit the humanoid Dalki.

'Damn it, the Dalki's special trait. The more they bleed, the faster they get. Now that blob is actually becoming quite a fast blob. Hurting it more is only going to make this job harder for me.' Vorden thought.

"Now, it's time for us to act," Peter said.

The humanoid Dalki pulled back, and in return, Peter came forward instead. When it threw out a fist, Peter jumped up and showed that he was even faster than the Humanoid Dalki, and the speed had impressed the others as well.

"You know, I never chimed in or got involved with this little match of yours," Jake, the vampire leader who had come along with the group but stayed silent for nearly most of everything, began to speak. In the first place, he wasn't really close to any of them, and his closest person was Peter, who never talked much.

"But that was because I was confident that he could deal with it all himself."

Bringing out his strange baton, Peter used all his strength and slammed the weapon down towards the ground. This gave a chance for his two other lesser wights to come in. Legs moved and spun around, digging her tail right into the Dalki's chest.

It cut through the hard scales easily, but after piercing a few inches, it came to a sudden halt.

"Hahaha!" the five spike Dalki hollered, "You finally managed to pierce me, but it's not enough!"

It was at that moment that Legs did something strange. It moved away and detached its tail, leaving it in the five spike Dalki's body. The next second, with its foot's bottom, it kicked its own tail deeper into the five spike's chest.

The great pain caused the five spike, forcing it to tumble as the tail inched closer to his heart.

"Don't worry; we just need to kill you so she can get her tail back!" Peter shouted, but he wasn't the next one to strike. Rather, it was the headless Hilston. He spun on his toes and activated the beast gear on his body, and he, too, punched the end of the tail.

It was a good thing that Slicer's tail was one of the strongest things in existence because the punch was sure to break most things. Due to the punch, the tail moved in deeper and had somewhat pierced the Dalki's heart. It could feel it, but it still wasn't dead yet.

"Hey, I have to be the one that finished you off!" Peter shouted as he swung both his fists back, then running forward and jumping in the air, he thrust them both ahead at the same time with all his strength. As his fists hit the bottom part of the tail, it not only pierced through the Dalki's heart but continued through to the other end, and the next second, the five spike Dalki fell to the floor.

The others were speechless as they watched what had happened. Vorden had planned so much in trying to defeat the five spike, and Sil thought that he was the only one, the only one out of the whole group, who could take down the five spike Dalki.

"When did he get so strong?" Raten complained. "He freaking won the contest, didn't he?"

"I mean, there wasn't a prize or anything," Fex replied, wondering what the big deal was. "But yeah, Peter won."

Pulling the tail out from the Dalki, Peter threw it over to Legs, who got it with her feet. She then somehow managed to attach it back onto herself, which was a bizarre sight for the others to witness.

"Alright, Blob, it's time for you to wake up. You are my final fourth piece. With scales like that, I'll have an unbeatable team." Peter smiled.

A few seconds later, the others were quite surprised as they saw the large blob standing up from the ground once again. It looked the same as before, but now it had a hole in its chest.

"Holy Sh*t! You can do that?! You should have been there when One Horn died!" Fex shouted and now felt like he should have kept his body intact rather than used it for green blood, but that was a must at the time.

However, something soon caught Fex's attention. He turned his head and could see a large figure flying their way. It landed on the ground the next second, causing them all to startle.

"It's the dragon!" Vorden shouted.

Immediately, Peter went to get out of there with his Lesser weights; he wasn't in the best position after all. Everyone moved away quite fast, all for one, of course. The dragon looked down at the blob and immediately jerked its head forward, grabbing the five spike beast.

Lifting its head, they could see it hanging in its mouth. When it closed its jaw, its teeth ripped through the hard scales they all struggled even to scratch a few seconds ago, and after a few chews, it swallowed the beast, and that was the end of it.

*****

# Chapter 1548 - Half A Demon

Logan and Layla saw they were too late in stopping Jim's clone from unleashing the demon tier beast dragon. But they were still hopeful that perhaps they could figure out a way to put it back and place it in the same state it was once in.

'There has to be a way. The Dalki's managed to capture it and sedate it once. Which means we can do the same thing as well.' Logan thought.

The encasing around his arm had already fallen off, revealing his Dalki self. At the same time, Logan placed both his hands on the floor, and his eyes started to light up green. Upon noticing that there were intruders, Jim's clone and the Dalki immediately charged forward.

However, the next second, some of the wires seemed to come to life and had wrapped around their bodies. The vampire clone Jim slashed through them straight away, but it gave Layla enough time to fire an arrow full of Qi and aim it right in its face, thus killing it.

"Are you sure we didn't need him and his brain?" Layla asked.

"I have all the information he already has in here!" Logan shouted, charging forward. Although Logan wasn't as powerful as the others, and these were three spiked Dalki he was going up against, he still was a good fighter and had his suit on with him.

He charged in, running right underneath one of their arms. At the same time, while the Dalki was looking at Logan, two more arrows fired at the same time pierced them in the side of the head. They hadn't gone quite deep enough because of hard scales, but jumping up, Logan grabbed the arrow with his Dalki arm pushing it in further, killing it on the spot.

Now there was only one Dalki to deal with, but they could see that all of the wires had gone off from the demon tier beast, and the liquid was draining from the container as well. Logan was distracted looking at the demon tier beast and was hit by the other Dalki right in the chest.

Layla caught Logan mid flight with her powers and safely placed him down as she got her sword ready and unleashed one of the black balls. When hitting the Dalki, The spiritual chains held it in place. She didn't activate the sword this time and started to strike at the Dalki again and again.

She avoided its hits, but the sword seemed to be somewhat blunt as it could not pierce through its skin. Now being able to use Qi on them instead, she had five arrows hovering around her back while in the middle of the fight and using her sword. When she saw an opening, one of the arrows would aim for the Dalki's head or heart.

In the end, they finished off the last Dalki too. Logan had recovered and ran over to the console, but the Dragon had flapped its wings as the base's ceiling started to open. When it fully opened, the last thing the two of them saw was the Demon tier beast flying out of the base.

"We screwed up!" Layla said. "The demon tier beast is free. What if it runs away?!"

Looking at the sky and where it was heading, Logan felt like it wasn't going to run away for some reason.

"I think that would be the better option if it ran away. If it decides to fight us...then the only thing we can do is fight back."

Reporting back to Linda, Logan made her aware of the situation, and he then contacted the others as well.

"Don't worry; we know it's here!" Vorden replied back. "It's right in front of us."

This was what Logan feared. It looked like the only option they might have was to fight the beast head-on and kill It.

"Come on; we have to help them, Layla. They might need every help that we can give them. The demon tier beast just woke up. It's probably a bit dizzy, and I saw that they already took away a lot of energy from it. You were right; if we have any chance of beating that thing, the time is now." Logan said.

Although he didn't say anything about the special black sword yet, he thought if it was able to work against the Helen Dalki, it might work against the Dragon. They were still unaware of the side effects or where the sword came from, but now was not the time to worry about those things.

On the other side of the Lab, Linda had just received a news update from Logan about what had happened. Now she was in the middle of a conundrum.

'Should I go help out the others…I don't think there are even anymore Dalki or vampire clones in the lab. All of them are most probably killed…but then I can't leave Borden...'

Glancing to her side, she noticed he was peacefully asleep in the glass container. His body had already regained its normal size and was floating there; whatever was happening, it had worked so far. She kept an eye on the terminal as per Logan's instructions.

Some of the energy transferred to him was coming from the Demon tier beast; however, it looked like there was still enough energy to be extracted and was either stored somewhere or was in the pipes for Borden to continue whatever he was going through.

'I'll stay here until you need me, guys. I hope you will get through this.'

So far, on the journey to the Dalki main base, none of them felt fear when fighting against the Dalki, not even when they went up against the five spike Dalki. It was only now that they had seen the Demon tier beast landing in front of them did they become very cautious.

Its sense of power was beaming from its body, and everyone at the scene could feel it; however, the final nail in the coffin was the fact that it had so easily crushed the Dalki that all of them were struggling to even scratch.

"What's the plan, Vorden?!" Raten asked.

The Dragon looked their way and flared its nostrils. It was clear that it wasn't just going to let them buy time. In fact, the next second, it flapped its wings, producing a large gust and roared so loud the sound almost blasted their ears drums.

However, two figures were unaffected by the scream and could move at that moment. Those figures were Legs and Hilston. Under Peter's order, they moved in front of the beast. And it looked like they were about to repeat what they had done last time.

Spinning with her tail, and building momentum using the strength of her tail, she swung her tail against the Dragon's front Legs. However, unlike what had happened with the five spiked Dalki, there wasn't a single scratch on the beast after the attack.

What had worked for the last time didn't work this time.

"We were planning to face this monster anyway, so we have to fight. If we can't hurt its scales, then we go for its eyes! Last time, the dragon was dealt with, it faced off against six spiked Dalki that Jim had artificially created. So We can also defeat this thing!"

However, Raten knew that if the five spiked Dalki couldn't pierce it, what could he or Vorden do. Even though they were both Demon tier beasts, this one was clearly at another level.

"I think I heard of this beast before that the vampires fought it long ago!" Jake shouted.

It was then that the great Dragon swung its tail. All of them decided to avoid the blow in their own way. Vorden flew up in the air, others jumped, and Raten turned into mud, sinking in the ground.

The tail had missed them all and only missed Fex by a few inches. But they noticed that the tail wasn't slow despite the beast's size.

"Tell us, Jake! How did the vampires defeat the beast?!" Fex asked.

Realising the vampires were the ones that had initially caught it, they must have had found a way.

"The originals..the originals worked alongside the leaders to take it down, and soon after were put back to sleep…this beast was something that nearly defeated the strongest vampires of that time."

# Chapter 1549 - Seeing Everything

The whole group was still in the giant crater. It now felt like they were doing battle in a giant arena against such a beast. A beast that perhaps might be too much for them to take on.

"That's good news!" Raten shouted, overhearing the conversation that went on between Fex and Jake. "If the vampire originals were able to take down this thing, and the six spike Dalki, then it means it's not impossible. We can do it as well."

At this point and time, Fex wasn't too sure, and he remembered that last time, his strings were practically useless against this thing.

Rushing onto the field before anyone else, though, was Sil, who grabbed both Legs and headless Hilston and chucked them back as far as possible. The next second, the Dragon's feet stomped the ground, and the impact led to the destruction of the surface. Rocks were chucked out in a circle along with a radiating energy, which Sil was able to jump over at the right time.

When landing, he placed both hands on the ground, and a giant wall of earth appeared from the floor. A wall that was as enormous as the Dragon.

"Peter, order your wights out of this fight!" Sil shouted. "I'm telling you now, if they stay in the fight, they will die. Everyone, just do your best and follow my instructions when you can."

Sil moved to the right using his super-speed, and the next second, the Dragon burst through the wall. Its head is the place Sil stood a few seconds ago. It was then that Vorden remembered something.

"Everyone, listen to Sil. He has the foresight ability; he can see what will happen next. If we listen to him, we might be able to get out of this!" Vorden ordered. Usually, he was the one in command, but he was quick to know when there was someone better and when there was not.

Then, flying in the air, Vorden tried to get a better view, but as soon as he ascended, the large Dragon flapped its wings again, generating a strong wind force from them, but thankfully, Vorden's wings were sturdier.

The type of beast he was, was a strange one in the first place. His wings were heavy, strong, and sharp as well, yet he could still fly with them.

"I am a Demon tier beast as well, and you are only half of that. I refuse to believe that you are so much stronger than me!" Vorden cried.

He soon shifted through the wind creating a large gust of wind through his constantly swinging his arms. Each time Vorden did, a powerful wind strike would shift through the air. In doing so, it hit the Dragon on the tip of its nose.

It sounded like a sword was bashing against its face, and although it didn't break the scales, it was clearly annoying the beast to some degree. In anger, the Dragon looked like it wished to move, but when looking down, only to see one of its legs sinking into the ground and it struggled to pull the legs out.

This was Raten's doing. He was also a Demon tier beast, and his powers were far stronger than he had previously let on. His powers allowed him to turn any substances into the same mud from which his body was made. The only thing was that Raten liked to fight in hand to hand combat.

Still, he had turned the ground underneath into a pit of endless mud. Usually, the Dragon would have been able to lift its other leg, but it was unable to this time. This was because its other leg had landed into one of the traps that the sixth family leader had set up.

"It really stepped right where you said it would." Jake smiled. His ability wasn't strong enough to stop the whole Dragon from moving, but if activated at the right moment, he could stop at least one part of Dragon's body: the other leg. The problem was trying to trick it into stepping into his trap.

However, with Sil being able to tell the Dragon's next movements, Jake didn't have to lure or trick the Dragon. He knew exactly where it would go.

"Nate, are you ready?!" Sil shouted.

Since it could not move, the Dragon was getting desperate. It decided to use one part of its body that was strong, flexible and quick: its gigantic tail. The Dragon then took a large swing at everyone once again, and Nate braced himself with the shield in his hand.

The Demon tier shield was meant to absorb the energy, so in theory, there was no need to brace himself, but seeing such a gigantic tail swing at him at such a speed, he couldn't help but worry.

The middle part of the tail bashed into the shield and stopped that instant. It was, without a doubt, a Demon tier weapon. At times, Nate would doubt its strength, but being able to withstand the impact from a Demon tier beast's tail proved its worth.

"Throw me the shield!" Sil shouted, and Nate chucked it like a frisbee. Seeing where it was going to go, Sil leapt up, grabbing the shield, and held it out towards the Dragon's body. It lit up in blue light, and now the Dragon had to deal with twice the power of its own tail attack.

A blast so strong left the shield that it went out in one bang and covered the whole body of the Dragon. Immediately, its legs lifted, and it fell to its side, shaking the entire ground as it fell to the floor.

'I can't believe it.' Fex said, witnessing the whole battle. 'With Demon tier beasts, demon tier items and Sil… they are really taking out the beast against which we stood no chance before?'

To top it off, as the beast head fell to the floor, there was one person waiting for it at the exact spot where he needed to be as per Sil's instructions.

"There is a reason why you're there and not me...because, without a doubt, you are stronger than me." Sil smiled.

Throwing out his fist, Peter threw a punch as strong as possible. His veins all over his body tensed, because he wasn't going to hold back even a single ounce of his strength and attacked as if his whole life depended on it. The Dragon noticed that Peter was aiming for its large eye and tried to shut the eyelid, but Peter was far too fast.

His fist went straight through the eye, and the power of the punch itself exploded within it, causing a gush of blood to pour out everywhere, and its head to swing about widely in the air.

Flying through the air, Vorden landed next to his brother Sil. It was clear the fist had hurt the beast, but a single damaged eye wasn't going to kill it.

"What do we do now?" Vorden asked.

Soon, the Dragon's body started to glow green, and as it got up on its two feet, Peter and the others moved away from it once again, surrounding it in a circle. The next second, its scales were no longer green, and when it opened its eye...to their shock, the eye was once again in a perfect condition.

"This f*cker can heal itself!" Peter yelled.

"Don't worry; there's one more piece to all of this," Sil reassured.

Coming out from the side and into the crater were two more people. One had already transformed into her true Hannyma state, while the other had his Dalki hand out. Layla leapt up as Logan threw her, pushing the bottom of her feet towards the Dragon.

Holding out her sword, Layla had it activated as the markings on it began to glow. And intense pain rushed through her head, but she didn't dare to back down in this situation.

As she flew through the air, strings had suddenly wrapped around the head of the Dragon, and Fex attempted to pull down on it. The Dragon, of course, lifted its head, easily breaking the string.

"Well, at least I can be a distraction. Are all lizards this stupid?" Fex said out loud.

This allowed Layla to get through with no trouble, and her black sword pierced right in the Dragon's long neck. She let go and quickly landed on the surface, leaving the sword stuck in the neck.

"That sword is special...the dragon shouldn't be able to heal while the sword is inside its body," Layla shouted as she stumbled upon landing and tried to maintain her balance. The more she used the sword, the worse it affected her, and the time left for how long she could use it was declining rather than increasing.

On the way, based on the information Logan had gathered from the database, he knew the Dragon was capable of this, and it looked like someone else knew all of this was going to happen.

"Just how far in the future can you see?" Vorden asked, but he didn't receive any response because Sil's chest had suddenly begun to glow.

"Enough to see that I will be the one to kill this beast," Sil replied as he slowly raised his head and stared at the Demon tier beast, the Dragon.
