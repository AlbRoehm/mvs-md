# Chapter 1750: Celestial Weapon.

Usually, at this time, the Amra kids would be enjoying a kick about with their ball, but instead, they all were in a lacklustre mood. Solas hit the ball, barely kicking it off the ground, only moving it 2 feet before it landed.

Walking over to the ball he had just kicked, he sat down and placed two arms on his hips while the other two were on his face.

"I guess none of us are in the mood to play?" Gina asked, standing next to Solas and looking at all the others who seemed to be sulking equally.

"It's just annoying. I mean, Geo is a good guy, he helps everyone, and it sounded like they were treating him like a criminal when he had done nothing wrong at all," Solas replied.

"And now we have no clue when and if he will be coming back."

Looking away from the kids and now looking around their neighbourhood, Gina kept an eye on all the Tower guards in the community. They had arrived a few hours after the events with Geo, Nock and Quinn.

After seeing them off and entering the tower upon returning, three units with their squad leader arrived. They were asking multiple questions to everyone and mainly to do with Quinn. It was clear that they didn't see him as a hero by the words they were using and the questions they were asking.

Although, Gina understood that. Due to him attacking the tower, there were those in the city who now knew his name and what he had done, but attacking something so sacred made them wish death on him.

However, what was most upsetting to the children was that Geo the one that looked after them every day, was treated as an ally of Quinn and had been put on the wanted list. Even though Nock and Dober had gone with Quinn, they hadn't gotten the same treatment.

"Maybe it's a good thing that they are still here." Gina smiled.

"After all, it's already been a few days since those guys entered the tower."

"The fact that they are still trying to gather information on them must mean that they are still alive and in the tower."

Still, solace didn't look as hopeful.

"Three days," Solas replied with a raised eyebrow.

"How far could they have even gotten in three days, the third floor? With the others chasing after them, the only way out of this mess is for them to keep climbing."

*** *** ***

The red of the walls could be seen reflecting on Quinn's face. The expression on his face showed that he was in full concentration. He was unharmed nor tired, but there were plenty of sweat beads on his face.

This was all because of where they currently were. It looked like they were inside a volcano, as lava was running down the walls while a pool of lava was directly beneath them. When looking up, one could only see a large wall that was endless. It was as if there was no ceiling at all.

"I never thought that I would be fighting like this, but nothing seems to be working on you so far." Quinn thought, tightening his grip around the weapons in his hands, allowing more blood to fall to the floor.

Currently, in Quinn's hands were the twin tail chains. They were wrapped around both arms and went further than before when digging into his body, reaching a little past Quinn's shoulder. They then started to spiral towards his chest slightly, but the pattern they were trying to make, whatever it was, it was unable to be made out as they had stopped there.

It had been a while since Quinn had used his soul weapon, at least the item-type soul weapon he had. This was because it required blood to be used and was only helpful if he was fighting multiple opponents.

However, this time Quinn was only fighting a single opponent. It was hard for him to tell if it was a beast, and the system could not tell either. It was gigantic, being eight stories high.

It was a creature made completely out of rock-type material and reminded Quinn of the Amra people a little bit but looked nothing like them. It had two giant limbs that looked like arms. However, its forearms were three times bigger than anything else on its body.

While fighting, it would lift these up and swing them down, meaning to crush its opponent. The only thing was when it had attempted to do this at Quinn. He had punched upward, destroying the giant creature's arm.

The thing was, the giant creature's arm had quickly grown back, and on its head, where there were free large pillars with a set of two slit-like red eyes, it started firing energy blasts towards Quinn. Quinn quickly avoided all of these, and using his blood powers, hard fists and martial arts, he punched the giant creature, destroying a part of its body bit by bit.

Regardless, each time it would just restore its body parts as if nothing happened. No matter where Quinn hit the giant rock beast, he couldn't find its crystal, so he doubted that it was a beast.

Still, Quinn was in no danger. He never felt threatened by the creature, and watching him from the edge of the platform where they were fighting were Geo, Nock and Dobber, who had been told not to get involved since all three of them had passed this level before.

"It would be embarrassing to ask for a hint after telling them I would do this myself." Quinn thought. "So let's hope this works."

Ever since entering the tower, Quinn had found it quite strange. Each floor was wide and full of people. It felt more like he was going to a different country; the land was so vast and wide. He mainly saw Amra, but he did spot what looked like some humans and creatures from other races inside.

While on a floor, each place differed from the last and contained several different beasts and more. On the floor, one would need to search for a unique door. This door would lead them to the next floor.

Getting to a door was relatively easy. At least Geo said it would be for the first few floors. Although these doors often moved and changed places, people shared information on the lower floors as to where the door would be.

According to him, most up to the tenth floor would be supportive; as for beyond that, he didn't know what it would be like, but judging by the fact that competition was more fierce, he didn't think they would be as willing anymore.

Finding the door wouldn't just allow one to pass through it, though. One would then have to face a specific challenge. Sometimes they were done in groups. Others had to do it on their own, and not all of them were fighting a dangerous beast.

Quinn had to use his head to solve certain puzzles, avoid traps, use different skills and more, and right now, he was in one of these rooms, hoping to advance to the next floor. Since Quinn wasn't struggling with fighting against the creature, he decided to see something.

He had an idea that ever since evolving, perhaps his soul weapon would be a little different. After all, he could use blood attacks without it affecting him, so maybe the twin tails wouldn't affect him anymore.

What he didn't realise was the fact that the whole weapon had changed. The jagged edges that would stick into his own body and on the weapon itself were glowing and had grown in size.

His HP was still somewhat affected as he had an open wound on his body, but it wasn't draining him like before.

"These feel stronger. Is it because it's taking in the celestial energy out of my blood? I guess you like the taste of it, huh."

"Well then, in return for my special blood, you better show me something amazing!" Quinn started as he lifted both of them behind his head and jumped up in the air.

"Let's see what you can do!"

***

# Chapter 1751: A Quick Climb.

A final swing on the twin chain blade was thrown, slashing an almost tennis-sized ball of the creature. It sliced through with ease, and simultaneously several small blades of blood created around the arena had stopped.

An instant later, the weapons lit up in a bright red before disappearing. The jagged edges stuck in his body also started to disappear but unlike the part of the weapon that was out of his body, the ones that were attached inside his body sunk into the skin as if getting absorbed.

It was a strange feeling, and it wasn't exactly pleasant to look at, including for Quinn himself. As for the others in the room, they slowly walked forward, tiptoeing toward the human.

They had witnessed him do incredible things multiple times before, but this was beyond anything they could imagine. What they had seen just didn't make sense to them. The power was what they had most likely heard of that was only achievable to those on the higher levels of the Tower.

"When I look at him, it feels like he really was meant to enter this place." Geo thought.

"Finally." Quinn huffed. "Looks like that beast isn't coming back anymore. Now we can move onto the next stage, right?"

"This doesn't make sense." Nock was the first to speak out of the three Amra.

"The creature is really not coming back. Does that mean he destroyed every single part of it, so it could no longer regenerate, or it ran out of energy?"

"I didn't know that was possible. No, out of all those who passed the test, I've never heard of anyone who defeated the Gate leader in such a way."

"What do you mean?" Quinn raised his eyebrow. "We weren't meant to defeat the creature? Is there another way?"

The thought did cross his mind when Quinn was fighting the creature. How did the others pass if what he had just done was the right way to pass this floor?

"You should try and look at your surroundings a bit more." The elder Dober commented.

Seeing how Quinn didn't still quite understand, Geo decided to explain.

"There might be more than one way to get past this Gate leader. However, the most common way is to push off the beast from the platform and into the lava below to stop it from regenerating." At that moment, Quinn felt a bit embarrassed, as pushing off the beast did seem to be an easier option. But he had just gotten so caught up in the challenge in front of him that he wanted to figure out a way to defeat it with his powers.

In the end, a large door appeared glowing in the middle of the platform. Having seen these before, Quinn knew he had to push it open to reach the next floor.

"This tower is really strange. Quinn thought. From the sounds of it, everyone who passes the tenth floor has defeated the same creature."

"How is that even possible unless the tower celestial of this place has beasts he can use as he wishes?"

"And then there are these doors, Going through them, it's as if they teleport us to a different location."

"Honestly, I'm not even sure if we really are in the tower or if the large object in the city is just a ploy of some sort."

"Either way, this whole thing reminds me of a game, even more so than my system."

Passing through the door and stepping onto the other side, Quinn was treated with an entirely different scene than he was used to. Usually, the door would just chuck them into a land in the middle of nowhere, and they needed to try and find the door themselves.

However, they were in front of what looked like a town this time. It looked similar to what Quinn was in before. There was a clear sky, buildings, a market place, and more. What was also noticeable was a large castle that was placed at the very back of the town. Above it, a blue light source seemed to shoot upwards, piercing the sky.

"This is the tenth floor" Geo started to explain. "There is no trial here, but it is a safety point. Those who reach the tenth floor can live in the tower."

"If you head to the castle, they will also make you a tower guard and explain your duties to you."

"Once you have reached the tenth floor, you can always get back to the tenth floor without the trials."

"Of course, there will be those from higher floors down too, and also, as I just said, if you choose to leave, you can always come back and come straight to the tenth floor."

"Of course, you can choose to go back as I did, or you can serve the tower and continue to climb."

Immediately reaching the tenth floor, Quinn noticed something: the weight on his body. Once again, it felt like the gravity had increased, and his movements were slower than before.

Geo noticed Quinn moving his hand about multiple times, and it was getting faster in seconds.

"I hear the higher levels get worse. Usually, people train here for some time before they start to climb again." Geo explained.

"We might have a problem with climbing though," Nock explained.

"The door to the next floor is in the castle itself. I doubt that they would just let him through with what Quinn did to the tower. So we might have to try and sneak in or something."

"Three days and only on the 11th floor. This is taking a long time. I wonder if there is a quicker way to climb the floors. How do you get back to the tenth floor?"

Quinn asked, "How does it know if you have left the tower that you have reached the floor before."

"You should have felt a strange energy inside you once reaching this floor." Geo continued to explain.

"When you enter the tower's main entrance, a little rectangle object will appear in front of you, asking if you wish to head straight to the tenth floor."

What Geo was explaining sounded a lot like a system. Perhaps the whole tower had a system that was created by the celestial. How one could do such a thing was probably an answer he needed from the celestial himself. Whether Quinn would be meeting him or not was another thing.

The group parted ways to understand the situation around the town, and Quinn had used his shadow powers to summon up his trusty cape that he kept in the space to conceal himself. It was a request from the other three, and he had to stay this way, at least for the time being.

According to Dober, many trading stalls on the tenth floor might have the parts they needed to create a spaceship. If Quinn could leave this place as soon as possible, then that's what he would do.

Heading down an alleyway, the group had met up once again.

"It, as I suspected, it looks like the tower guards here have been asked to keep on the lookout for a human and as well as you, Geo."

There were other races that looked similar to humans here, so Quinn, with his small frame, didn't stick out too much, but according to Nock, anyone who at least resembled a human figure was being treated as a suspect.

"I don't have good news either," Dober added. "Although there are parts that we can use to help make a ship, they all belong to the higher floors."

"The people aren't willing to trade for them unless we give them an item of the same value. So the only way to get them would be to climb."

On top of that, not all the parts are on this floor. We would at least probably have to get to the next checkpoint on the 25th floor to have everything we need."

The three looked disappointed, but Quinn wasn't worried.

"I assumed this would be the case anyway. So you don't have to worry. Let's just head to the castle and play it by ear."

The others didn't think it was the best to go without a plan, and seeing how Quinn had dealt with things before, they were worried that there would be another ruckus..

"I'm sorry, but I must climb this tower quickly and return to the others. Don't forget that you're free to step back and leave at any point and time on this journey."

The others didn't say anything and just looked at each other and smiled. Maybe with this person, they would be able to see floors they had never witnessed. And that in itself was an offer too good to refuse.

At the same time, while Quinn thought he was moving through the tower floors slowly, the others knew that it was the fastest time ever someone had managed to get to the Tenth Floor. They were witnessing history in the making.

Quinn continued to walk down the alleyway, and as he turned his head, he heard a little ping.

"What the is that... the system? Why's it going off now?" Then, just as he thought, two prompts appeared before him.

[Congratulations, you are now a level 3 Celestial]

[You have unlocked new skill]

[Entrance to the Celestial World]

***

# Chapter 1752: Celestial World.

The system hadn't been active as of late, and honestly, although Quinn did expect the system to go off at some point during his trip in the tower, he never thought he would suddenly get a level up out of the blue.

"Level three, what does this mean?"

Quickly, Quinn went to check his other stats; meanwhile, the other three standing behind Quinn were left confused. All they knew was that Quinn had stopped just before entering the street. They thought that maybe Quinn had seen something. Either way, he was clearly focusing, so none of them said a word while he concentrated.

[28546/31256 Celestial energy]

Seeing this number, Quinn was absolutely stunned. It was expected since the last level up was related to his celestial energy. Quinn believed it would be the same now, but to have this amount of points suddenly.

"How is that possible? Is it because I entered the tower? Did someone give me these celestial points or something, but that doesn't make any sense." Quinn scratched his head, trying to figure it out.

Still, there are only a few possibilities. Either it was something related to a tower, something related to a celestial or lastly, that the condition had been somewhat completed. If it was the latter, Quinn could think of a few things.

Andy had spread the news to the other vampire bases that were located away from earth, but whether or not it would amount to this many vampires, Quinn didn't know. Then there was Logan and Zinon.

Quinn had informed Logan of the condition he had, and perhaps with his influence, he had asked people to help. There were far more than 30,000 humans however, how many would actually do as Logan asked was a different thing altogether.

The other person, Zinon, Quinn, also thought that if the request was made by him or Logan, then perhaps he would be able to convince the people as well. Either way, it now meant he had a lot more points to play with.

"I don't have to worry about creating celestial weapons for the others now with this many points, and I can give them as much as they need to keep them safe." Quinn thought.

However, right now, Quinn wasn't planning to do that just yet, because there was a celestial that was currently quite close to him. There was no way for Quinn to gauge their strength, meaning he would need all the celestial points he could get for the moment.

On top of that, Quinn didn't have the others present to inform him if they were at their limit or not with the celestial energy, so it would be a dangerous thing to just suddenly give them more points.

"What's this new skill?" Quinn thought.

[New skill - You have unlocked "Enter the Celestial world"]

[The Celestial world is a space that only Celestials may enter. When in the celestial space, time is significantly slowed compared to the outside world.]

[Celestials will only appear as an energy form while in celestial space. The space was created as a way for celestials to communicate with each other, even if they are a great distance apart. Only celestials who are currently using the space will be able to be seen.]

[Please note that due to your current level, limited features will be available to you while using the Celestial space. Please continue to level up to get more features.]

"A space just for gods, that's typical and somewhat expected" Quinn thought and smiled.

"Why would they even need such a thing... and what if I were to enter the place, how would the other celestials react?"

Thinking about it a bit more, Quinn couldn't help but resist the temptation to try it and see what it was. After all, he decided that by the sound of it, it didn't sound like one could actually get hurt in space. Since his real body was active outside. He was concerned about just how long was significant when it stated that time would be slowed down.

"Sorry about this, guys. I just need to focus on something for a few moments. If you guys could look over my body, if anything comes up, that would be great." Quinn said, walking back into the alleyway and sitting down against a wall.

The others thought Quinn was acting strangely, but then again, they didn't really know what humans were like, so they decided to just let him do his own thing.

"I have to enter that space. If there are other celestials in there, then maybe there is a chance that Bliss will be in there as well, and she might have an answer on how to get me out of this place."

"Then there are those other gods that reside in the other plane. If I'm right, then it means that all celestials, no matter where they are, can enter this place. There might be a chance to find him."

Thinking about this, there was some guilt felt in Quinn's mind, because he had promised Ashley and the others that he would find a way to turn them back to humans. Yet, he never did, but he did have somewhat of an answer, finding the god that Richard Eno had contacted long ago.

According to Logan, it was a god named Imortui, the same name that Laxmus had spoke when attacking the vampire settlement.

Quinn, a while ago, had put two and two together but even after becoming a god, there was no way for him to go to the other side, and perhaps he had found his answer.

[Skill activated "Enter the Celestial world"]

As soon as the skill was used, Quinn could feel his mind, his whole body leaving where he currently was, and now he was suddenly in a white space. It reminded him somewhat of the Power fighters game. However, one could tell that this was real.

Looking at himself, Quinn could see that he was just a glowing figure, an outline of his human shape. Just an energy source with no details on his face or body, it would be near impossible to tell it was him.

[Before entering the Celestial space, please choose your Celestial name.]

A screen appeared in front of him, just as his system would have done, but this was clearly not a system screen from his system. It was glowing with power and felt more radiant with energy.

"A name, I guess I shouldn't go for Quinn. Otherwise, it might cause Bliss to run away from me. I might not be able to see her now, but maybe I can in the future."

[The name BB has been selected.]

For some reason, Quinn could only think of the letter B, and Buinn; he felt like it would give him away a little too much. Anything related to his past, he felt like Bliss would know about, which was why he had to come up with something completely new.

[Very well, BB, welcome to the Celestial world]

Once again, Quinn felt like his entire body was being dragged and mushed up, then thrown about. Then, it felt like his body was being moved at speed faster than he could comprehend.

It reminded him of when he went through the portals until, eventually, it had stopped. Once again, he was in his human energy form. Looking at his arms, Quinn felt somewhat lucky that he was alive and in one piece. Shortly after, he looked around to appreciate what was in front of him.

"All of this... it's so beautiful." Quinn thought.

It looked somewhat like he was in space. Multiple colours were floating around, small little white objects like stars. However, it wasn't black or dark like space was. Instead, it was incredibly bright.

Looking around. Quinn could see other figures of energy. They were outlines of what they looked like. Some appeared to have a human shape, while others looked like beasts. It was hard to tell what they were because of the energy sources.

Still, there were more than Quinn could ever imagine, as the space was packed and seemed to endlessly go on.

"So this is the celestial world."

[Ding!]

[You have received a message from another celestial, would you like to open it?]

***

# Chapter 1753: A whole new system.

Looking at the notification that Quinn had just received once again, he could tell that it wasn't from his own system but was part of the system used to enter celestial space.

"Wait a sec, in the past, the system has always made things easier for me to understand. So is the system doing the same for me now?" Quinn thought.

Maybe this system was actually from his own system. Either way, it was a detail that didn't really matter much. What he was more concerned about was who and what this message was.

[Welcome BB, my name is Xox, and I'm one of the celestials that helps out the newbies. Here is a greeting message as a hope that the two of us can work together. I just thought I would send you a note before meeting you in person.]

Reading the message, Quin didn't know if he was lucky that the message didn't come from Bliss or someone he knew, but he also thought it was very bold of this celestial to believe that the two of them would meetHowever, just as Quinn had finished reading the message, he could see a round floating ball of energy coming toward him.

There was no shape to the energy like the others. It was just a ball about half the size of Quinn himself.

"Hello there, I'm Xox. You must have just got my message." A voice came from the floating ball of energy.

"Yeah... wait for a second, you just...how did you find me? How did you know who I was?" Quin replied, quite surprised. He believed the celestial space was a bit of a safety area.

For one, there were so many celestials all around the room, each looking different yet similar at the same time, so how did this ball of energy know who and where he was?

"Ah, well, I thought you might be a little confused, which was why I took it upon myself to help the new ones like you," Xox replied.

"Also, your confusion is indeed quite valid. Although I don't know who you are or what type of celestial you are on the outside, I can read your energy."

"Every celestial energy is slightly different, and since I am a person who likes to spend nearly all his time in this space, your energy was unfamiliar and new."

"So, looking through the name list, I just popped you a message while heading down here."

It was a sound explanation, and Quinn could tell what Xox was saying was true. The energy everyone gave off in this place was distinct. But, unfortunately, Quinn could not tell what Bliss or Imortui's energy reading was like, so finding them would be impossible unless he went up to every single one.

When Quinn also tried to bring up this list of celestials that Xox spoke of, the system had come up with a message.

[You are unable to access this feature, please level up to unlock more features in the celestial world.]

Whether to trust someone for the first time he met them or not was a different thing. It wasn't as if everyone he met for the first time was terrible, Geo was a clear example of that, but it was the fact that he had never really met another friendly celestial.

"I mean, these guys are gods, right? The whole balance thing, there should be some good ones or at least some like me, but so far, they all seem to be doing things just for their selfish benefit." Quinn thought.

"If you're really here to help a new celestial like me, then can you tell me what the others are doing? And what are those white balls they are standing around." Quinn asked.

Just as he finished asking the question, he saw one of the energy figures disappear, and it looked like they had been absorbed into the strange white ball.

"Sure!" Xox said, moving his whole body as if he were nodding. "The white balls are different solar systems belonging to this Universe. As for what the celestials are doing, they are discussing matters."

"Many celestials work together to help fulfil their condition, you see. They are discussing the best plan and course of action to take. As you are quite new to this, it would be helpful to talk with as many celestials as possible."

"After all, if you stay in your solar system, or with those you know, your growth will be limited. You might never feel satisfied."

"In fact, part of the reason why I offer these services is so that we can work together as well."

"Who knows, one of these days, I might actually get close with a big shot and become a big one myself."

Now learning of this fact, Quinn felt like he could trust Xox. There was a reason behind why he was doing things.

Celestials were looking at entire solar systems with billions of lives and discussing the best course of action amongst themselves. And it was the first time that Quinn felt like he himself was one of such gods.

Just then, Quinn saw another energy form disappear into the white light.

"And what was that we just saw?" Quinn asked.

"That was the celestial accessing that world. Not every solar system is in the same plane you see. It also allows the stronger celestials to move quickly from one solar system to another. It's the fastest way."

"This is also why making connections and discussing with others is essential to ensure you don't step on the toes of another celestial if you enter their space." Xox explained.

"Before you try anything though, just know that only the higher celestials can do such a thing, and I am sure you're a long way from that."

Hearing this gave Quinn little hope of going back to his world and also visiting other solar systems, but how to search for the right solar system was another thing altogether. Still, he remembered that Richard Eno had found a way to access the place without becoming a celestial himself, so Quinn thought he could at least try to look for one too.

Besides, to even get the chance to access a feature, Quinn had no idea what level he needed to be at and how much more time he would need to complete his condition. To Quinn, making more connections sounded tiresome and not something he wanted to get involved with, with all the other solar systems at least. Just one was enough trouble.

Xox moved away into a small group of celestials around one of the white orbs of energy.

"Come on. This is your chance." Xox shouted.

Following, Quinn could hear the others discussing, but when he had approached, the others stopped.

"Let me introduce you to a new celestial guy. I thought it might be great for you guys to get acquainted with him." Xox took the lead.

The others stared at Quinn for a while. Honestly, Quinn wasn't sure if he wanted to be doing this in the first place, but he thought about what was the worst thing that could happen. He goes back on his deal, and the gods try to kill him?

"Sure, we can talk." One of the other energy forms, who had two big antennas sticking out from where his head would be, said. At least Quinn thought they were antennas based on what he could see.

"All of us are from the solar system Narxer, but we mainly focus on the planet Yumen. This is because they have the most life forces, and our conditions mostly revolve around that." The celestial started to explain.

"Not all of us from the solar system are here right now, and we already have a deal set up with another but were always looking for more partners. And the thing is, there are two types of partnerships, one of which allows you to use our planets."

"In this, you help us with our condition, and in return, you can do what you want to help yourself, as long as it doesn't interfere with ours."

"And that's where the discussion phase comes in. In that, we will debate and finalise a deal."

"Or we can go with the second method: a more extensive partnership. In this, you can access our solar system, and we have access to yours."

"However, this would require more discussions with those that are part of your solar system, the other celestials, and since you're new, I doubt you have much say over them."

"Anyway, what solar system and planet are you from anyway?" The celestial asked.

"Oh, erhhh, we have named it the Milky Way galaxy. I don't know the names you use to refer to my galaxy and solar system. And the planet I am from is called the Earth." Quinn replied.

He had a hunch they would at least have heard of the Earth.

At first, Quinn also thought that perhaps he was giving away too much information, but seeing how many celestials and white energies there were, he didn't think they would know of all the celestials and locations in this place.

This was until the group in front of him suddenly stepped back and quickly moved away from him as if he were some plague.

"What is this reaction?" Quinn was surprised.

***

# Chapter 1754: The troublesome one.

Although Quinn couldn't see the exact expressions on the others faces, he could tell how they felt by their actions. Some of them were visibly pulling away, almost flinching, and a few were just taken aback by his words.

"What is this? Everything changed when I said Earth. Do we have that bad of a reputation or something?" Quinn thought.

Often when he thought about the human race and what they had been through, he wondered if Earth was a normal place or not.

Meeting the Amra race, he was glad to find out that they were pretty similar to humans in their traits and characteristics.

"Is this fear or disgust? I really can't tell... if it's fear, who are they afraid of? What celestial is toying with us so much that, are they afraid of us?" Clenching his fist, this thought, in particular, was enraging Quinn a little.

Since it didn't look like his new friends were willing to talk, Quinn decided to turn and look at the one who was. The large ball spun itself when Quinn locked eyes with it, and immediately spun around and started almost running.

However, in less than a second, Quinn had managed to run ahead of it and block its path.

"I don't quite know the rules of this place yet, or if I can even hurt anyone in here but believe me, I will try before I get some answers!" Quinn pulled his fist back, preparing his punch.

"No, no, I'll talk!" Xox replied, shaking his whole body side to side. "Just please promise me if I tell you why we are acting so strange, you'll just leave me alone!"

To get the floating ball acting this worked up, Quinn needed to know, so he nodded to the deal.

The Celestial ball let out a large sigh before he started speaking and then started to float away from the others so they could continue doing their business as usual. No doubt though, that they would be talking about Quinn.

Once they were away from everyone, Xox was ready to talk.

"There are actually a few reasons why people don't want to work with anyone from Earth." Xox started to explain, and it looked like he was looking to his left and right, although the ball had no eyeballs, so Quinn couldn't tell other than by the swivelling of his body.

"It's gotten quite the reputation as a troublemaker planet. So much so that nearly everyone has heard of that planet which is quite rare for a single place."

One of the main reasons it has caught the eye of many of the bigger celestials is because there has recently been a rise of a god slayer from that place. I'm sure you should know a little about them, but if you don't, they are always a worry for us, since it's in the name we gave them.

"Anyway, it's caused an even bigger stir ever since a god slayer that has come from Earth has started to enter other solar systems and other territories. On top of that, he has also slain a couple of celestials."

Hearing this, Quinn was quite surprised. Someone from Earth was actually capable of killing Celestials? Although he knew that not all of them were celestials because of their strength, they were still in a high position in which they would have been able to use resources around them.

On top of that, when trying to think of who it could be, Quinn only knew of two that had left Earth to do such things, one of them being Ray and the other Sil.

Although Quinn didn't know if Ray had actually left Earth yet, he wasn't someone he really needed to worry about. Quinn had received a taste of his power before, which reassured him about his capabilities.

"They couldn't be talking about him... right?" Quinn thought, but unless Richard Eno was still actually alive, then there was no one he could think of.

"But still, because of the god slayers, they have reacted like that?"

"I can tell what is going on in your mind, but that's not all." Xox continued. "You see, Earth has a large number of lives. Due to the conditions of many celestials, it is an attractive place for many."

"However, not many have attempted to migrate or go to Earth because there are already strong Celestials there currently, which is why even with the trouble of the god slayers, no one has decided to try and do something."

"But because of this, the Celestials who are just as large and strong are now eyeing up Earth as well."

After hearing all this, Quinn had gone back to when he was alone with Bliss in the white room. Now what she was saying had made sense. Her story and Xox had matched up. But, while deep in this thought, Quinn hadn't noticed that Xox was pulling away.

"Wait!" Quinn shouted. "How do I find other celestials? Which one of these glowing lights is the Earth? And do you know someone named Bliss!"

However, Xox continued to run away in the distance while shouting. "We had a deal!"

For a second, Quinn did think about chasing Xox down, but in the end, the latter was right, the two of them had a deal, and it wasn't like he had done him wrong.

Now on his own, Quinn attempted several things. First, he had approached a few of the white energies to see if there was anything he could see or do However, the system would state that he would need to increase his level before being able to do anything.

That included bringing up the list and more. In fact, the only thing Quinn could do now was roam around and talk to other celestials. However, it looked like no one was willing to speak to him.

The celestials around it would start to step away when approaching some of the white balls of energy. It was an apparent reaction to his arrival.

"I didn't even do anything, and I already have a reputation here." Quinn sighed.

"With nothing else to do, I should just head back and see how the others are doing. I don't know how much time has passed or if I will ever find Bliss."

This time, bringing up his own system rather than the one used in this space, Quinn activated the skill, and his whole body felt like it was being turned to mush once more. Then, opening his eyes, he found himself in the alleyway he was in earlier, and the multiple arms hovering over him proved he was in the right place.

"Sorry about the wait. How long have I gone for?" Quinn asked, standing up. All-Novel--Full. C0 m

"What do you mean?" Geo frowned. With a confused expression, he added, "You just closed your eyes and then opened them again."

"Are you okay? You have been acting a little strange for a while now, at least, I think. Unless something happens to humans that makes them go crazy this time of day."

Hearing the question, Quinn didn't reply. It was because he was amazed. He had at least spent a couple of hours in the other space, yet Quinn had sat down and stood straight back up to the others. Rather than slowing time down, it was more like time didn't move at all.

"This does mean that I will probably never find Bliss? If she spends a significant amount of time on Earth, and with the two points of time being different, it's unlikely we will meet up."

"Unless I stayed there for thousands of years or checked every passing second."

Although it wasn't a way for Quinn to find Bliss or do much else in the space, it did make him think of something. When running to stop Xox, he had run at full speed, and even with his body in an energy-like state, he was just as fast there as he was here.

"Sorry guys, I might be gone for a few seconds this time. I just need to try out a few things." Quinn smiled.

# Chapter 1755: The Strange one.

"Have you heard about the one from the milky way galaxy?" One of the celestials leaned over and whispered to the other.

"Oh right, there is a new celestial on that planet now. Hopefully, it means things are looking up. If new celestials are coming, then surely it means that they will be able to get rid of most of the god slayers."

"Wait, if the current celestials couldn't do anything, do you think a new one will make a difference?"

"It could be a few thousand years until the new guy can grow strong enough to clear that mess."

"Look, you all make good points, but I wasn't talking about that. Maybe it will be easier if I just show you guys rather than explain?"

A group of six celestials were moving through space at a fast speed, and after a short while, they arrived in front of the celestial they were talking about. The person in question was none other than Quinn.

The group continued to stare, with more coming and leaving after getting bored as for what they were witnessing. Some didn't understand what was happening and what the others were doing here.

"This is what he has been doing this whole time?" the celestial said.

"Rather than using this space to check on potential planets or communicate with others, he has tried to find the most open space possible?"

"Well, most of us have been trying to ignore him anyway, so even if he did talk to others, they would just walk away!"

"That's why I think that might be the best action now. Maybe this is his way of trying to grab his attention?"

"But doing this... doing these things isn't going to help his cause at all. We have seen far more impressive things and different causes."

Finally, the group of celestials that would come and go seemed to stop arriving to stare at Quinn. Finally, he had the space he needed to focus on what he was doing. There was a big concern for Quinn in the past, and that was time.

There was hardly any time for Quinn to do things properly. Due to the crazy events that would be happening to him or others. Even now, Quinn was rushing to head back to Earth, worried that something could happen to them,

However, he made up for that time with his ability to quickly learn and comprehend things. Vincent had given him a few compliments about how quick of a learner he was, but Quinn didn't know if the former was just saying those things or not.

Eventually, though, through his experiences, he even realised that he just could grasp something he had seen and try to implement it in different ways. Or to make his own creations come to bear fruit. And sometimes, even this would be an understatement to his comprehension talent.

Now, in this space, he had plenty of time. How long he had been here, he didn't know. When concentrating, he lost track of time, and time felt unreal inside the space. The concept of a minute or an hour in a place like this just felt a little silly when he thought about it.

Still, when resting, he also spent time trying to do other things and learning more about the space. His super hearing was still effective, just like his speed in a place like this, so there was no need to communicate with others. He could just pick things up himself.

One of the things he learned was where he currently was. When entering space, it would put you in a location next to the galaxy you were currently in. So the White ball of energy closest to him would allow him to see the Amra planet and the others next to it.

Although Quinn never found any celestials around the planet so much, at least not those that looked like the Amra race. He believed there would be at least one celestial that looked like them.

Trying to locate Earth from here was impossible. In this space, one could move in all directions, including up and down. So there was no way to confirm what area the Earth was in.

One day, Quinn had attempted to just run through the entire place looking for it. He ran and ran, checking the white balls of energy before anyone could say anything, but he never did find it. Instead, he was being called all sorts of weird names, and all of the celestials looked at him weirdly.

Through this experiment, though, he found that there were celestials that could just move to another location through space by pinpointing where they wanted to be. But it was a feature for the higher levels, of course.

Which was why he had other uses for the space, and he was finally confident enough that he was ready.

[Would you like to leave the celestial space?]

[Yes]

Upon pressing the button, an involuntary sigh of relief appeared on his face, and now back in the alleyway, Quinn looked at the others again.

"It's good to see all of you are still alright. How long was I out for?" Quinn asked.

"Well, at least in this turn, you were doing something for some time. I think it was around ten minutes." Geo replied.

Quinn nodded and tried to move his hands a bit, but to his surprise, his own body felt foreign to him. Mainly because of the extra added weight from the planet they were on.

"Come one, let's go," Quinn said, already walking out of the alleyway and heading down the street straight for the castle.

"Does this mean that you've devised a plan on how we're going to get to the next floor?" Nock asked.

He couldn't hide his nervous expression anymore as he looked over his shoulder to see if there were any guards or anyone following them.

"I know what I'm doing. You guys don't have to worry about that. If you just stay behind me, you guys will be safe." Quinn replied.

Geo certainly didn't like the sound of that, and Nock was increasingly getting worried the closer they got to the castle. Now they were almost at the bridge where two tower guards were present.

"Haha, I like this human!" Dober said. "I never knew this place could get so exciting. Doesn't this guy just make your blood boil?"

Up until this point, they were still walking together until Quinn ran straight ahead and instantly reached the two guards. Then, he grabbed both of their heads and slammed them into each other.

The next second before they could do anything else, he threw them both by the heads into the sky, hurling them back to the town where they had come from.

"I thought as much. He has decided to fight. I don't think this is a good idea. It will just make the next set of floors even harder!" Geo shouted, but Quinn was nowhere to be seen. All-Novel--Full. C0 m

Quinn had already run across the bridge and destroyed the large door. It was only now had they heard the delayed sound of the slam from the ruptured door. The three looked at each other in surprise and quickly ran in the direction where Quinn had gone. However, a few minutes later, as they entered the castle walls, they came across a grim sight they had never expected.

The tower Amra were all beaten, and on top of that, they had large cuts all over their bodies. It was not just one or two, though. The ones that stationed the wall, those on the floor, already around thirty or so. Amra had been defeated and so quickly.

"Look at that." Nock pointed to the ground.

Looking, they could see Amra's blood creeping towards the main hall and entrance of the castle.

Just what are you doing, Quinn? What happened in these ten minutes while you were away! Geo thought.

Looking up, they could soon tell where all the blood around the place was going as something cast a large shadow over them.

***

# Chapter 1756: Blood Forest.

The castle was huge, and there was a lot of ground to cover. On top of that, Quinn wanted to attack before they could react. Thus, he needed no distractions for his plan to work, which was why he was running around, defeating anyone he could find.

He wouldn't outright kill them and just needed to injure their bodies to an extent where they would no longer get up, but he had to use his speed to the max to run faster than he usually could.

One way to do this was to use the Blue fang set, but that only worked for a limited amount of time, and on top of that, this was Quinn's trump card. It was a very special set that got him through very dire circumstances, so instead of using it from the get go, he came up with a new technique.

During the fight with Russ, Quinn had discovered he could use the celestial energy in his body by making a cut on himself, and currently, he had a small cut on his leg that allowed the blood to flow out. Then using his other abilities, he hardened the celestial blood, creating himself a pair of blood boots.

Now at the right time, as he moved his legs, Quinn also would use his blood control skills to speed up the blood around his legs simultaneously. This allowed him to surpass his current limits and move even faster.

However, it wasn't as easy as it sounded. To maintain the speed, he needed an immense amount of control to match up the movement of blood and his own legs, but during his time in celestial space, he was somewhat able to practice this technique.

His body in the Celestial space didn't work the same way as it would on the outside, but Quinn's body was still the same. It was strange that he still had access to his body to control celestial energy and use his abilities.

It made him wonder since he never saw anyone fighting in celestial space, there had to be a reason for that, but he never did find out. Nor did he know what would happen if one was attacked or killed in celestial space either.

Either way, Quinn was now running all over the place, beating all the guards one by one, and finally, he had reached the main centre room that he was looking for, where the source of energy was piercing the sky.

The castle had a courtyard in the middle, and a strange device gave off energy. It looked like a portal was lying flat on the ground. It was also by far the most guarded place in the whole castle.

Quickly scanning through the area, Quinn could see ten guards around the portal, another ten on the square-shaped second floor and another ten on the first floor. Then, without hesitation, he busted through a door and found himself Quinn was on the second platform, looking down at the guards below.

He quickly leapt over the railing and straight towards the portal. At the same time, using his nail, he pricked his finger, and blood started to pour out. It was only a tiny cut, but the blood that came out of it was far more than usual.

Quinn's eyes started to glow red, and shadow covered his body, putting away his armour and revealing his bare chest. The blood armour instantly covered his bottom half, and one could see all the red lines of energy pulsating through his body.

"That's the one Athos has been looking for! Attack him!" One of the guards shouted.

"I'm sorry, but you won't even be able to get close to me." When Quinn landed, a red pulse went out from his heart.

It was a dense form of energy that looked to be coming off his boots as it spread out towards the guards. And when it hit them, they felt a tingling sensation in their bodies until Quinn lifted his hands.

[Skill used Blood forest]

Immediately, the red blood aura had almost fallen to the ground and had become a liquid substance, more like real blood, and in less than a second, sprouting up from the floor were what looked like plants made of blood.

However, they weren't like regular plants, and one could tell based on the gut-wrenching screams of the guards that the blood had acted like vines wrapping around their legs, and at the same time, it was as if they grew sharp thorns that immediately grew and stabbed into all of their legs.

It had pierced the hard exterior of their body with ease, and the strange thing was there was no blood. On the contrary, the blood vines from the strange blood plants that had dug into them were getting wider with every passing moment.

Eventually, all the blood started returning to Quinn, and some went inside his body while most of it was forming an object slightly above him.

Geo, Dober, and Nock had finally caught up, entering the courtyard and found the fallen Amra looking helpless, unable to move with large holes in their body.

"Quinn, what are you doing?! I thought you were better than this! What happened?" Geo shouted.

Quinn started to speak without looking at them and still forming the object above them.

"I didn't kill them, don't worry, Geo. I wouldn't do that to your people. I know you care about them, just like I care about my friends as well."

"But, you don't understand how these beings see you, how the ones at the top see you all. I'm sorry if this sight upsets you a little."

"Maybe I have become a little numb after everything I have seen, but I don't plan to be like them, never do I want to be like them, and the worst thing is..."

"I'm a little afraid that I might change, but before I do, I want to do everything I can while I'm still sane!"

Blood from Quinn, the Arma around him, and the ones he had injured moved into the object above, which soon took the form of a giant greatsword. Although the sword looked solid from far away, up close, one could see it was made of blood.

When finding out that time in the celestial space moved differently, Quinn felt like it was finally time for him to learn. He then learned how the absolute blood control ability worked, which he had received for becoming king of the vampires.

He also focused on understanding how his celestial powers could be used and formed to improve his combat and shadow skills and to find a way to utilise everything he had at his disposal. When using his soul weapon, Quinn realised that his current body was not what it was like before. It has undergone many changes, and he has only touched the tip of the iceberg. Now he was ready to take on anyone.

"Wait, how are we going to get to the 11 floors? We need the guards!" Nock shouted.

Quinn took one look at the three and smiled at them.

"I never planned to go through the doors in the first place. This is a shortcut!"

Crouching down, Quinn jumped off and started to spin his body. As he did, it looked like a vortex of blood was covering him, causing him to spin even more until one couldn't even see Quinn in the air anymore.

But at the last moment, Quinn swung out his leg, which was bright red as if one was looking into the sun itself and kick the large hilt of the sword.

The sword started changing colour from the bottom as it glowed and reached the tip. It immediately went through the air, constantly making bangs and finally, it had reached where it needed to. All-Novel--Full. C0 m

It had pierced the ceiling, spinning and breaking it like a drill, large crumbs were falling from the sky, and the giant blood sword continued going deeper into the Tower.

"I had a theory I wasn't so sure about, but it looks like I was right," Quinn said as the others stared at the sword in utter shock and disbelief.

On the top floor, where Athos sat on his throne, a frantic female ran inside the room.

"Sir. I don't know how to tell you this, but the human has reached the 50th floor!"

# Chapter 1757: Burst-Through!

The sword attack had broken the illusion of the bright sky above. As the pieces of tower continued to fall on the city, the residents raised their heads and stared up in shock, their hands plastered over their mouths, and the children in the area were crying, looking at the scene.

After all, some of them had lived in the tower all their lives. Because once one person had entered the Tower, the whole of their family could also join, and so could the future generations. Therefore, not all those who lived in the tower were strong amra's, nor had they stepped foot from outside. And seeing the damage caused by the blood sword, they could only think that it was the world's end. To them, a demon had created a sword of blood that everyone could see, and now the sky had turned blood red as the hell had descended.

As for the person responsible for it all, he was still standing in the courtyard, looking up at what he had done.

"My theory was correct after all." Quinn thought.

After exploring the celestial space, Quinn had linked the special tower doors and the tower together. It was strange how each floor felt like they were in a completely different place, almost like they were on another planet, and that's when it clicked.

It didn't just feel like it was a different place. Each of the doors was almost like a portal to another area. When looking at the outside, although the tower was expansive, it wasn't enough for the space they were exploring.

Things didn't match up, meanwhile on the tenth floor the sky looked extremely high and the blue light of energy must have meant something, which is why Quinn believed that the rest of the floors, the living quarters where the amras actually lived, were real parts of the Tower.

Having blasted a hole straight upward, it looked like he was right.

"The celestials were able to create the celestial space, so creating actual dimensions, trial rooms and other things for themselves wouldn't completely be out of the question." Quinn thought.

Since he was no longer using his celestial energy, his armour wouldn't burn if he was to use it. Now using his shadow, the chest piece had soon attached to him again, and his wings had sprouted.

"I will ask you guys again, are you sure you want to come with me? If so, then you will need to hold on." Quinn said with his hand held out.

The three amra looked at each other, they honestly were stunned by everything happening and didn't know what to do, but in the end, there was one that took the first step.

"You are one crazy human," Geo replied, holding his hand. "I have never seen anything like you. For a long time, I have thought, why are the lives of those in the tower different from those outside it? I want to ask our god these questions."

Quinn now started to know why he liked Geo quite a bit, and the answer was because he reminded him of himself. Reminded him of his old self.

After seeing that Geo was going along, Nock couldn't fall behind and quickly ran over as well, and finally, there was Dober, who just smiled as he held on to one of the wings.

"You won't need to do that. I will let you guys see everything when I get up there." Quinn said as he activated his shadow and placed each of them into his shadow space.

Straight after, bending his knees, Quinn blasted off into the air. The arma from below could see a small person flying up to the hole that he had just created in the distance.

They couldn't quite tell what it was but could see large black wings on its body. This was because Quinn had activated his shadow.

"What is happening? Is that an angel!" A little child looked over in awe.

"An angel? Don't be foolish. I don't even think that is an amra. Don't look at it." A mother said, placing her hands over the child's eyes.

Quinn moved fast with his wings and was able to reach the hole quickly. He wasn't flying as fast as he could run, but he was still agile and swift. When going through the hole, it was as Quinn had expected.

The next moment, he found himself on the ground floor of another city. This time it looked different to the one below. The technology being used had advanced, and Quinn could see more high-rise buildings and different technological specs here.

The Amra even seemed to wear more clothing similar to humans in fashion. However, the style was completely different as everything seemed to be a different shade of green and nothing else.

"Catch the intruder! We have to stop him at all costs!" An amra guard shouted.

Continuing to fly upward, Quinn could see most of the Amra on this floor were already alerted of his presence and had equipped themselves for a battle. They also wore slightly different coloured clothes, which was most likely to show the status of being someone from the 25th floor.

In their hands, they had large tube-like weapons, imitating something somewhat like a bazooka. While others had objects that looked like canons, and finally, some just had rounded rocks in their hands.

"Fire!" the commanders shouted.

Being thrown by the larger, stronger amra were several different coloured rocks of all shapes, sizes, and colours.

The first one to reach Quinn was a red-coloured rock. Using his wing that was covered in the shadow, he was able to block it, but the second it made an impact, it exploded.

The amra who had made the hit had jumped for joy until the smoke had cleared up and everyone saw that Quinn was unharmed.

Of course, he was because the demon tier armour and shadow powers were the best defence one could get. And when the other rocks started to come towards him, Quinn decided to do something else.

One green-coloured rock came from his right, and using his wing he sucked the rock in. Then straight to the other side, the rock had come out of the other wing and aimed below at some amra guards.

It came out just as fast and destroyed the whole building in which it crashed.

"That was a powerful throw, but not nearly as much as the one I received earlier, which means there are even stronger ones above." Quinn thought while holding two more rocks in his hand that he had caught mid-air.

Once again, Quinn threw both of these down at those below as he sped up and started to fly even higher into the sky. After all, Quinn's goal wasn't on the 25th floor, so there's no need for him to waste any time here.

Now that the Amra were alerted and would be waiting for him on every floor, it didn't seem like they would give him the ship's equipment without a big fight.

The far quicker and in this case and moment, the easier option was to talk to the tower owner and ask them directly to get him a ship so he could leave this place. Flying up higher towards the purple sky this time, Quinn was about to reach the second hole he had created.

As soon as he passed through, he reached the next floor and landed on the hard grey-coloured ground. He stood with spread wings, looking up. This was because there was no hole in the sky this time.

"So my attack could only go through two floors? Whoever made it must have made this tower out of some strong stuff."

Seeing as there was no one around them for now, Quinn decided to release the others. When they got out, they stumbled a bit but quickly regained their balance and began to look around.

"Wait, where are we? This doesn't look like where we were before. Are we on the 12th floor?" Nock asked.

"Wait, I've been on the 12th floor too. This looks nothing like the 12th floor." Geo said.

When the other two looked around, they noticed huge three-tiered mansions off in the distance. They were all somewhat shaped like a temple. The ground was flat everywhere, and the only thing they found was the large mansions, around twenty in total.

"I have only heard about this place." Dober started to speak with sweat running down his face.

"This is where the 'Sedi' Ranked amras live... some of the strongest amra live here... Oh my... we are on the fiftieth floor!"

Just as Dober finished speaking, the suddenly began to shake and before the three of them could react, amra's, much larger than all of them, began to land on the grey floor in front of them.

Other than their size, another thing to note was that some of them ever had a different coloured outer skin than the rest.

"This is nice... I guess I get to use a little more strength against you guys." Quinn smiled, unphased by the huge amra's in front of him.

[Item type soul weapon activated.]

***

# Chapter 1758: The Amra Evolve.

"There is something seriously different about these guys compared to the others." Quinn thought, looking at the Amra that were known as the 'Sedi' rank.

They were slightly larger in size by about a quarter compared to others, their shoulders were broader, and the colour of their outer skin was also different.

It almost looked and felt like they were part of a different race. It was hard to believe someone could change this much.

Is it the tower? Has some sought of evolution made it, so their bodies have Changed?' Quinn thought. One thing was clear. They were far stronger than the other Amra. It was why he had decided to summon his Soul weapon.

Either way, it didn't matter too much, and this didn't look like a situation that Quinn could just fly out of this time. Immediately, two of the Sedis had a strange green-coloured rock and threw it right at Quinn.

Using his demon tier piece of equipment that still had the shadow activated, Quinn stretched them out to hit the rocks. This was because bringing them in to defend himself would have taken more time.

It was the quickest action he could take. As the rocks had hit Quinn's wings, they had stopped mid air, but something strange happened that hadn't occurred before. Several vibrations came out, hitting the air like ripples.

When attacks hit Quinn's shadow, it would either slow it down or stop the attack altogether if it was a more condensed form of the shadow. Because of the Demon tier chest piece's special ability, the wings shadow acted more like the latter, as a defensive mechanism stopping any attacks it touched, no matter how great.

Although this had stopped the physical aspect of the attack, it seemed like something else was occurring Hitting the air, a large ringing sound could be heard in Quinn's ears, and it was becoming extremely painful for him.

I can't hear anything! My head feels like it's going to explode! Quinn soon could see around eight more of the green rocks coming towards his front.

Tyring, his best, he shook off the strange feeling and decided to face the other rocks head-on.

"If blocking them isn't the right thing to do, then I will just have to attack head-on instead."

Lifting up the twin tails blades one would think he would start to swing them towards the Sedi. However, Quinn instead had bashed his two weapons aga inst each other. At that moment, several chains had broken off his blade.

There were five parts from one part of the weapon and five parts from the other, allowing for ten links to be in the air. The blade looked broken for a few seconds, and where the parts had come off, it almost looked like human muscle.

The chains, deep within Quinn's body, started to swirl around more and the two twin tail blades extended out again, returning to their original length, but the ten pieces were still floating about, and they soon started to glow red.

Quinn had retracted away his shadow wings once more, and the red veins on his body started to show, as celestial energy was also running through his soul weapons.

"I'm sorry, but unlike the others, I don't think I can give you the chance to live, but if you give up now, I will spare your life," Quinn stated.

The Sedi didn't listen and instead picked up more rocks they had brought with them, ready to attack from a distance again. Seeing this, Quinn had no choice; the floating chain links grew red, and went straight towards the rocks.

It had pierced right through them. The rocks were split to even more parts going past Quinn, but he could easily avoid them, and for the ones that he couldn't he lifted his blade slightly, allowing it to deflect.

"What is that weapon, and those links able to block an attack from the Green rock. That weapon must be something from the gods!" One of the Sedi said.

In a way, they were right. Similar to how Quinn could now create celestial weapons, his soul weapon had become a celestial weapon itself. There was a large boost in its power, its durability, just like when celestial points were given to the others, and at the same time, there were more things it could do compared to before.

"Let's get rid of a lot of you in one go!"

With celestial blood running through the weapons, Quinn could control the other links with his blood powers. They went right past all of the Sedi, moving at an incredible speed, but the Sedi also knew they weren't coming towards them, so they started to leave.

However, they did do something strange. There was a separate link that was placed in between a few of the Sedi. Placing both his weapons out to the side, they started to glow bright red, and so did the links.

The next second, a red aura, just like when Quinn used blood, came out of the links. It continued to move, and the red aura had wrapped around, the back of the Sedi connecting all of the links together and finally connected back to Quinn's blade.

It was then, using all of his strength, Quinn pulled forward, while also restricting the aura, to constrict and make the area smaller. The Sedi felt something suddenly hit their backs, a strong force that was slightly burning into their skin from behind.

They were lifted off their feet and were coming directly towards Quinn. When they were only a few metres away, the twin tails glowed bright red again, but their form started to change, and this item looked like gauntlets.

Meanwhile, the ten or so links that were behind them had changed their form into swords as well.

"I learnt just like with Peter, how he had an image in his head he could create when using celestial energy, that I could do the same." Quinn thought.

Moving his hands, it looked like a red aura around the whole area was gathering in seconds. Just with his fingertips, he made what looked like a type of claw shape. Red lines were cutting the air around him.

The whole area was distorting, and even the ground around Quinn's feet was disengrating a little.

"Inside that space, I learned to return to my roots a little. I always prefered hand-to-hand combat rather than all of these blood skills, so why not do something that's more suited to me."

The Sedi had somewhat recovered in the air and had wound up their fists, ready to punch the enemy in front of them.

Twisting his foot on the ground, Quinn had pounced from his position, leaping with great power, and swiped his hand, aiming for the fist. The red lines of power still flowed, and as they touched the hard rock hand of the Sedi, it had gone through like it was butter. Blood could be seen for a split second coming out of the hand, but it almost evaporated into a mist and had joined the red aura behind it, making it grow larger.

Using his other hand, Quinn had slashed at its stomach, and the same thing happened there. Then before it could do anything, Quinn continued to slash with his hands causing the enemy in front of him to disappear into nothing but more vampire aura.

Quinn quickly moved, from one to another, using his new Celestial blood gauntlets to cut through all of the Sedi's attacks. Anything they touched looked like the enemy in front would just disappear, and Quinn was faster than them, and even if he wasn't and they were to touch his deadly claws, they would lose their own limbs.

In the end, the other three that had come with Quinn could see only him standing there, with the bodies of the Sedi on the floor, whatever was left of them.

"I'm sure there should be something on this floor we can use to trade for the spaceship parts you need." Quinn said.

Moments later, something could be seen falling from the sky, landing around 200 metres away. It was heavy and caused a loud dust cloud to rise, blocking the view of them all. Although Quinn couldn't see, he could sense the energy.

"It looks like the big guy has decided to see me in person."

# Chapter 1759: A meeting of gods.

The large object had crashed at such a speed that Quinn could not react against it. The only thing he did see was that it wasn't just a single object; rather, he had seen three in total. The dust cloud made by them had created a wave.

The grey-coloured flooring tiles were cracked, and the floor was covered in the smoke of dust. Looking around, Quinn noticed that the other three had been struggling to move ever since they had gotten here.

"Is it the Gravity?" Quinn thought.

"It is heavy here. my body was able to adjust to the speed a lot quicker, but for them, they were meant to get used to the changes from each floor."

"Jumping directly to the 50th floor might have become a problem for them."

All three of them had their hands on the floor, pushing off it like a giant weight was sitting on top of them. They were shaking as they utilised every muscle in their body. Lifting his head, Geo could see the wall of dust coming towards them and the hole not too far behind them.

"If we get hit by that, we're going to get thrown back into that hole! We have to move!" Geo thought.

"Nock, Dober, if we don't get out of here, that wall will hit us! Move your arses!" Geo shouted.

"Why... are you telling us...vsomething when you can't do it either!" Nock shouted back and managed to place one foot on the ground, and his upper body was upright. Two of his arms were pressing off his one knee, and Nock was now the one doing the best.

"Haha, at least if we die, I can say I bested you in my final moments." Nock smiled.

Dober was at the back, and that's when he could see something happening. The outer skin on Geo's leg looked like it was beginning to crack. At first, Dober thought it was a wound that Geo had received somehow, but he couldn't remember them getting hit.

When taking a closer look, he could see that there was no blood though, and instead, it looked like parts of his rocky skin were falling over, and a new shade of rock was coming through. In addition, the hide of the rock was somewhat thicker, increasing the length and size of Geo's legs by a little bit.

"He... is evolving into one of the Sedi ranks!" Dober noticed, but he also saw that it might not matter because the wall of debris was already upon them. Then, from the side, dense red energy came out of nowhere, sending the debris off in the distance through the air and crashing into one of the large mansions that was originally owned by one of the Sedi rank Amra.

"Did you guys think I forgot about you all or something? You guys chose to follow me, you guys are helping me out, so I won't just let you die." Quinn stated, still not looking at them instead of looking off in the distance.

Quinn briefly looked at his hands for a second, which were still covered in his celestial gauntlets. They made his hands look around double the size and were almost a solid black, like when Peter transformed, but also still had several red glowing lines coming down to his wrist and continuing on his skin.

Strangely, the chains that would be stuck in Quinn's body were still there, connected from the base of the gauntlets, sprinkling to his body till his shoulders and the top of his chest.

"The tiger form martial arts I practised did well when mixed with the power of these gauntlets, but every time I change the shape of the soul weapon, it has a different effect with blood."

"My fists were getting stronger each time my fingers went through their bodies. I could feel the blood was merging with my own powers."

"But now that he's here, if I have a big fight ahead of me, I will have to use everything I learn in that space right here and now."

Walking forward, Quinn didn't decide to be aggressive, but he wouldn't get out of this either in case he needed to use it at any moment. It was then that he felt a surge of energy from behind.

Although he didn't want to look away from those in front, turning around, he could see Geo standing there; at least Quinn thought it was Geo.

"It looks like I was right. The Sedi can evolve, which has something to do with this tower." Quinn thought.

Geo's skin now darkened, turning pitch black compared to before. There were also little sparks of white rocks throughout his skin, making Geo somewhat like a rare ore. At the same time, Geo was now just as large as the Sedi rank Amra. And he didn't just go through a simple evolution, but it looked like he evolved to the point where he could match the older Sedi rank Amra on this floor.

"I wonder, why do all of their skin differ from one another, even though they have all evolved."

Quinn thought as he saw Geo lift Nock and Dober off the ground with ease, placing them upright so they could stand on their own two feet.

"The two of them haven't evolved either."

Turning his head to focus on the front, Quinn found that the smoke had now slowly settled, and he could see two females with a golden-like skin colour on the outer scales. Since they were female, one thing to notice was that they had two arms instead of the four.

They were roughly the same size and width as the Sedi Rank, but he had never seen this colour on any of the Sedi ranks. The other difference Quinn could see and feel was that they both had a marking on their head.

It looked like a rectangle pointing upwards with two snake-like figures wrapping around it, but they did not have heads. Thinking about it, it somewhat looked like the tower from the outside in the distance and sensing the Celestial energy in them, Quinn could tell they were beyond that of the Sedi Rank Arma he had just fought against.

Finally, there was what could only be described as a literal giant. It was a large Amra that had similar traits to the rest. Its colour was also one that Quinn had never seen either. He had a platinum shine that was almost reflective like a mirror because his skin was somewhat reflecting everything surrounding him, from the Sedi Amra to the buildings.

However, the biggest difference was that this Amra had six arms, three sticking out from either side. This was the first for Quinn, and this perhaps was not just an Amra because Quinn could tell this giant was a Celestial too.

"This has become quite an interesting predicament. I never expected a god to just come to this place unannounced." Athos said in a booming loud voice that shook the entire area.

"This...this is our god... the god of the tower!" Nock said in a quivering voice as the echo from Athos words dimmed. They had never seen him before, never seen any images of him, but at first glance, they could tell who this was.

"Quinn, I was right about you... from the way you stand calmly, I can tell you don't feel anything in his presence. You really are on the same level as him." Geo thought.

"Maybe I can tell more now that I am just a bit closer to the two of you, but for me to reach where you two are, I think it would just be impossible for me."

"Good luck, Quinn... my friend."

"I never expected to come to this place either," Quinn said, still walking forward, not halting his advance.

"I only have one simple wish: to get off this damned place so I can return and help my friend. First, though, I might have some questions to ask you."

"I won't disrespect you since you are like me," Athos expressed.

"However, you have caused a lot of trouble on my planet. I am curious about your name and where you are from."
