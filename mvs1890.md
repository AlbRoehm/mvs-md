# Chapter 1890 The Strongest God Slayer

The sky had turned bright purple, causing the sea to have a strange purple tint. The land was full of vegetation, with trees, rocks and a few river streams there and in between. It was a heavily forested area, but it was not what it once was.

Most of the land was now destroyed, several trees were uprooted from where they were, hills had their tops blown off, and the seas had created tsunamis that submerged most of the coastal landmass.

What happened was not a normal thing for the planet, and everything changed when he arrived.

In one part of the area, the forest was completely uprooted for around a mile, and now there was nothing but dirt on the ground. When he stepped forward with a heavy foot, it sunk into the ground, and his tail shifted from side to side.

"Damn, these guys are annoying!" There was a Crystal in his hand, and not just any crystal but one which belonged to a demon-tier beast. "If I was in my normal body, then you wouldn't even be able to get a hit on me!"

Standing large, the person who looked somewhat like a Dalki with its tails and spikes but had a human face was none other than Ray Talen. Crushing his fist, he broke the crystal there and then.

"This isn't what I need, and you guys keep getting in my way. Just take me to the Nest Crystals!" Ray shouted in the air with an almighty roar.

Several beasts in the area could feel the power and instantly knew they were no match for such a person, so they decided to run away in an instant.

Out of frustration, Ray sat on the ground, and his form started to revert to a more human-like state. He now looked like a man in his thirties, with mainly red hair, but there were streaks of black hair as well.

However, like Borden, even in a human form, he could not get rid of all the scales on his face and arms. And these scales were mainly because the body he was currently in wasn't his.

It was the body of the Demon tier beast, the dragon, that had caused the mess of the Dalki in the first place. Ray's power wasn't what it used to be, and even then, his current body was under a lot of pressure, and it was hard for the dragon's body to bear even a small portion of his strength. However, he had to get stronger.

After absorbing a recent power he had inside him, he could somewhat unlock the powers he had before, but that still didn't solve the other problem he had, the fact that the body he was using was unable to contain the vast amount of power he had. This was why Ray had left Earth in search of Nest Crystals.

He managed to find a few and had successfully absorbed them, but he was annoyed after knowing how long it would take him to get his power back.

"Why did I even bother to get my power back?" Ray started to think as he stared at his palms and began to recall what had happened in the past. Ray had lived on Earth at a time when beasts still existed, but he himself was not a human. Rather, he was a beast.

He was one of the strongest beings, a dragon. However, a certain god named Bliss tricked him, and he reincarnated as a human. During that time, the world was in danger, and Bliss claimed that she had done what to avoid an unstoppable end of the world.

"I promised to leave it up to the future generations. I had already done my part for the human race." Ray said, but thinking about this, there was one thing that he never understood.

"What was Krad's goal? He wanted to bring all of the Dragons back from 'that' place. But, what even was 'that' place? It didn't feel like Earth and just reeked of death."

Whenever Ray would think back to that place, about the powers he had sensed in there and the troubles that were happening around him, the urge to regain his strength and become strong would come back again.

In the distance, crashing through the trees, was a gigantic hairless creature that looked somewhat like a dinosaur. It had a large head and small arms, but on its back were several legs, like that of a crab.

"I guess you weren't scared of my shout earlier, which means you must be a strong one!" Ray cracked his knuckles, and then kicking off from the ground where he was, he shot off like a rocket.

Ray had overshot himself though, as he was soon covered in black blood. He turned around when he landed on the ground, only to see the demon beat had already fallen and there was a large hole in its head.

"I guess I have gotten stronger than I thought. It makes me wonder though, where is the armour that I had before? Did Bliss hide it? If I had that, it would grow my strength as well. The armour was created from my own body. It's a bit weird to wear, but it just goes on to show how strong I was."

Resuming his search, Ray continued to fight beasts upon beasts, and soon when the numbers started to become larger, he realised that he might be getting closer to what he wanted.

Opening his mouth, he let out a breath of fire and burned all the beasts to a crisp. Ray then transformed and grabbed the head of one of the beasts, throwing it into the others and knocking back all of them.

Not wasting any more time, he just ran forward, cutting off limbs and more of the beasts he ran by, until he finally reached another Nest Crystal that he had been looking for.

Closing his eyes, he began absorbing the energy of the nest crystal as he always had. Then, just five minutes later, the crystal disappeared, and Ray could feel himself growing stronger again.

"That is a good feeling."

After saying these words, Ray noticed something up in the sky from the area he was just fighting in a moment ago. It was happening around four hundred metres from where he was, but the clouds were starting to swirl.

"What is that?"

White energy started to gather between the swirling clouds, and gradually, the energy began to spread out, only for it to suddenly shoot down, creating a wave in the sky and causing all of the clouds to disperse and leave a clear sky.

The beam of energy reached the ground. It was so bright that Ray even had to look away for a few seconds, but soon, the energy started to fade, and it completely dispersed revealing a person standing within it.

'So this guy teleported here?'

The figure was around the same height as Ray when he transformed and just as muscular as him as well. The person's skin was a dark grey like coal, and there were strange markings all over his body, giving him quite a strange look.

What stood out the most though, was from the back of his shoulders, there were two large serpents that were the same colour skin as the person in front of him. However, what concerned Ray even more was the look in the person's eyes. They were light blue, radiating with cold energy, as if this person had seen things beyond what anyone could imagine.

"I am the god known as Zeko!" The man declared. "You God Slayers have enough problems for us. This is why I have been assigned the task of eliminating you. But do not feel as if this life is unfair, this is just how the universe is meant to be."

"A God?" Ray smirked, grinding his teeth and replied to Zeko, "Well, this is good, but I hope you are a strong god because I have a message for you too. I f*cking hate Gods."

# Chapter 1891 Unlimited Endurance

Inside the celestial space information was being passed around just as had been requested. News had spread to the celestials and they were keeping an eye on each of the solar systems they were in control of, trying to see if they could spot any of the God Slayers that were on the special list.

Because of this, and due to the time difference in the celestial space compared to the outside world, it didn't take long for them to find the first troublesome God Slayer from earth.

"The ancient ones have made their move against those from Earth… will they find out what I did?" Yongbu was shaking as he was in the celestial space. Because he was the one that had helped not only BB head back to earth but also had helped Sil, one of the God Slayers that had been targeted.

Since he had heard the news that one of the God Slayers had been found, he was now heading to the direction of the planet where they were discovered. Just like before, a space was to be set up that would allow the celestials to watch the battle in real time.

According to the news, the god Zeko had yet to travel to the planet. He wanted to put on quite a show and was waiting for the other celestials to come and watch.

"Friend, your energy looks nervous, is something wrong?" Xox asked.

"I could say the same to you, shouldn't we be happy that there is a legendary battle taking place." Yongbu replied.

The two didn't realize it, but they were both worried because of the same person.

"I have heard from others that these God Slayers from Earth are strong." Yongbu expressed his worries without revealing his true fears.

"I have heard the same thing, but I would say we have no need to worry," Xox replied. "The gods that have been selected are pure fighters. Zeko is one that has endurance that is out of this world. There was once a similar problem of God Slayers on another race's planet.

"Zeko had been sent to deal with them, and he managed to fight with all of them for ten days straight without rest. Eventually defeating them all, and he still had the energy to continue fighting."

Yongbu started to light up slightly when he heard this about Zeko. There were so many celestials, so many gods that not everyone knew the details of every single one, but Xox of course prided himself on this knowledge.

Anyone who heard this would have confidence, after all the God Slayers were given their name because they had the ability to kill the celestials in the first place. So to hear that this was a veteran, when it came to terms of killing God Slayers, it had settled Yongbu's heart a little.

'Hopefully this whole thing gets sorted, without anyone ever finding anything out.' Yongbu thought.

Eventually the two had reached the area, and a number of celestials had already gathered. Standing in front of the area was Zeko himself, and although they could only see his energy outline with the two serpents coming out from his back, he seemed like a menacing force.

Unlike the other celestials whose energy was bright, his energy seemed cold, bold, and just powerful.

"I will prove myself to all that are here," Zeko said and nothing else, as he went into the bright ball of light for everyone to see.

——

The current situation was as it was, and Ray standing opposite the god could tell this would be a difficult opponent, gathering himself, his body started to change. The spikes came out from his body, a tail grew from his behind and now he was freely able to express himself.

"I don't like the way you're looking at me!" Ray shouted as he ran from where he was and threw out a lightning fast powerful fist. It had been blocked by Zeko, hitting it away, but the force of the punch alone had destroyed the trees that were closest in the background.

Ray punched again, and the attack was blocked once more. Zeko's reflexes were extraordinary and it was the first time that one was even able to block a punch without their whole arm being destroyed.

After blocking a few hits, Zeko threw a couple of fists of his own, but the top of them were slammed down by Ray.

"You think you're the only one that can block?" Ray asked.

At that moment, he could see the two serpents that were on Zeko's back had opened their large mouths and were aiming straight to bite down on Ray's shoulders to hold him in place. Seeing this, Ray opened his own mouth and a breath of fire had appeared.

It wasn't just any fire though, it was mixed with Ray's energy, causing the serpents to flinch for a second, and in that second Ray grabbed both of the serpents by their heads, closing their mouths shut.

He then swung the two serpents over his shoulder lifting the whole of Zeko's body and slamming it into the ground, causing a large crater to appear and cracks to appear around a mile in the distance.

Ray went to punch the god while he was down once again, but it was hit away. However, Ray didn't care as he unleashed a flurry of punches toward the ground hitting again and again.

The punches were blocked one after another, but that's when Zeko was noticing something.

'The punches… they're getting faster…'

Ray continued to throw his hands as fast as he could, and his eyes started to narrow as they looked more like that of a dragon. Eventually, Zeko was unable to block a hit while on the ground, and he was hit deeper into the ground. One hit, two hits, three hits, now hit after hit was hitting Zeko.

Eventually, Ray grabbed Zeko's leg and threw him into the air. Soon after, he jumped from the ground chasing after him, and appeared directly above him, as he sprouted wings, and with both fists slammed them right into Zeko sending him back to the ground again.

"Haha, this is great, your body is strong! This is the first time I have hit someone in a while and no holes have appeared in their body!" Ray exclaimed.

Getting up from the ground, Zeko wiped a small bit of blood that had come out from his mouth.

'This God Slayer is tough, but there is no god that has better endurance than me. Soon he will tire, and I will prevail!' Zeko thought as he charged forward, and threw out a fist towards Ray but completely missed, causing Ray to slam his fist right into his face, sending him flying back and across the planet.

——

Inside the celestial space, they had been watching the fight go on, the first day of fighting had passed, then the second, and now it had reached the tenth day. The two of them had been fighting mostly physically with their fists.

Most of the planet had just become miles and miles of craters that had been created from their fight.

However, they all had one thing on their mind, how much more could Zeko's body take?

On the ground was a worn out Zeko, his whole body was covered in purple and black marks, scars that were no longer healing and blood dripping out from every hole in his body.

Ray had delivered another punch from below hitting Zeko right on the chin. He flew up in the air, almost reaching the sky, and his limbs were lifeless as he fell back down through the air and landed right in the spot where he had been hit.

Zeko could no longer move, every breath was painful, while Ray, he had a few scratches on himself here and there, but he wasn't tired at all, despite fighting for 10 days straight.

"You're a monster…" Zeko painfully said.

"Me, the monster? Do I have to remind you that you were the one that came to me, picking a fight." Ray declared as he placed his foot on top of Zeko's head. "You damn gods are all the same. You think you're untouchable, but the truth is you're scared. You're all scared that your position on top will crumble."

Zeko started to laugh.

"You think killing me will do anything? There is a big difference between me and you. Even if you kill me I will be born again! The universe has declared that my life is more important than yours.

"And do you think I am the only one, there are plenty that can replace me, and they will chase after you as long as you are what you are."

Ray let out a big breath for a second, as he focused all his power into his foot. It had been a long time since he had to use anything like Qi, or gather his energy to a certain place, and with a stomp Zeko's head had exploded, killing him on the spot.

"If they are all like you, then I guess I won't have a problem," Ray said. "Are you watching?" Ray turned toward the sky, not knowing if there was anyone watching. "If you are, bring that damned Bliss here, I have a lot of questions to ask her!"

However, there was silence and no response, because even if they were watching they had no clue what to do.

Ray, figuring this out, decided to sit down for a bit. His body felt sore in many places, and he decided to lie down and look at the sky.

After resting for a few minutes soon Ray could see something in the distance. With his great eyesight he could see beyond the sky and into space and noticed something. It was an incredibly large spaceship, larger than anything he had seen before, and on the side there were some words written on it.

"Marpo Cruise? Now that sounds somewhat interesting."

# Chapter 1892 Next Target

Walking out of the cave after having just defeated the Demon tier beast, Agent 4 continued to walk into the direction where the two large energy readings were coming from.

Zero was getting somewhat impatient as he had a big smile on his face. His hands were twitching during the walk, if he could, he wanted to personally test Erin, and after seeing what she had done and sensing the energy inside her.

'I thought that the dhampirs' strength was mainly from their own personal aura. I knew that the dhampirs also learned Qi, but I never expected to find someone that has managed to cultivate their Qi to this level.' Zero thought, as he imagined what it would be like to use the Qi drain skill on her.

It would mean all of the power and all of the strength that Erin had would be added to Zero's strength. Then he could achieve what he needed to achieve, and if a certain individual was to back out of their deal, he would also be able to make them pay.

However, there was a reason why Agent 4 was walking rather than running to the scene, because he was carefully following the two large energy readings they were going towards.

On the device, the energy readings appear as circles. The colour of the circles changed from a red to a green and an array of different colours depending on how strong the reading was.

At the same time, once in a while, the circles would get bigger depending on when their energy was used. That was why it was very strange that every time there was a rumble, the ground shook like a volcano was going off, and the energy sources would get larger.

'Without a doubt, all this shaking, it has to be coming from these energy sources. What creatures have the power to make it feel like an eruption and earthquake is going off, even though we are so far away.'

According to the map, there were at least another 100 miles away. Of course, for them, this distance could be covered quickly if they were all to run at their full speed.

Picking up the pace, Agent 4 headed in that direction as his fear turned into interest. Just what type of weapons and armour could be created from such things?

As they continued to move though, Agent 4 noticed something else, and it was the fact that many of the energy sources that he believed were Demon tier beasts were starting to disappear.

Not just any, but the ones that were closest to the large energy sources they were heading towards.

'Zero you claimed that you wanted a challenge, well this is probably going to be the biggest challenge we have, but with the Blood armour that can block any attack, we should be fine.' Agent 4 thought while he was playing out the scene in his head… it had to be fine.

Eventually, Agent 4 slowed down as the magnitude of the rumbling grew louder. The shaking was so violent that explosions of lava had shot up from the ground.

"Just what is happening?" Flora asked.

"I think I can see it now… it's a fight." Zero replied.

There were several broken rocks that had been stuck in the ground creating what looked like small hills. On a closer inspection, they weren't naturally there. It looked almost as if the ground had been pushed out in such a way, similar to the debris of an explosion.

When standing on top of these hills they could see the ground had somewhat changed. The hard black exterior had somewhat been removed and now several pits of lava, as well as small looking veins of lava could be seen on the ground everywhere.

The heat from the ground was also immense. If the group were to travel on it, they would have to use their Qi to protect themselves, but their attention wasn't focused on that, it was on what was going on ahead of them.

On one side, they could see a red skinned muscular man, with a single horn sticking out of his head. It rose up high, almost as large as an arm. On its body there seemed to be strange circular balls as well.

Meanwhile, on the other side not too far from it, there was a giant Wyrm. A beast with a long large thick body and the head of what looked like a dragon. Its tail split in two at the end, and all over the dragon there was the same red vein-like material like that of the planet.

It looked like a vicious beast, almost godly. The radiating energy that was coming from it, it was too strong to be called just a demon tier beast. The one that could tell this the most was Erin, because she had the ability to sense its power.

'If I was to go up against that… it would be a tough fight.' She knew this, yet even though she knew this, the other human-like figure was the one that intrigued her even more.

Because the energy that she was seeing now, it was a white energy, an energy that she had seen only a few times before. Of those that seemed incredibly special, and it was a similar energy to the one that Zero was hiding.

He hid it well, to those outside, because he could condense the energy inside him, but Erin could still feel it.

'What are the similarities between these two?' Erin thought.

The Wyrm started to slither on the ground, and opened its mouth. Out from it several rings of fire had gone towards the other figure. Leaping off the ground, he seemed to avoid them all.

"You think I would let those rings touch me? I would never have lived this long if that was the case." the man said. He charged in, and the Wyrm noticing this charged in as well.

The strange balls that were embedded into the man, started to spin, and sparks of energy started to come out. Using his hand, he held it out with his fingers straight and swung it down right in the middle of the beast.

Its body continued moving forward and as it did, the hand from the man sliced right through the beast. It continued to move forward until it reached its tail and the beast had been completely sliced in half.

The beast was no longer moving, and it looked like the fight was over. Strangely, the man walked over to the beast and it appeared that something strange was starting to happen.

Right where the beast had been killed, Erin could see it, energy was gathering in a certain area, and finally, as it condensed, a crystal appeared just like that.

'The crystal, it wasn't inside the beast, to begin with, but I could see the energy moving from the beast, the dead body, to that location… What type of crystal is this?'

Erin was unaware that what she was witnessing right now, was the creation of a God Slayer crystal. Something that was unable to be destroyed. Even if the crystal was destroyed its energy and power would form somewhere else, which was why it was best for the celestials to just keep it themselves.

Lifting it up in the air, the crystal soon disappeared.

For a second, the man paused, and then when he moved again he looked in the distance towards where Zero and Erin were.

"A grand task has been bestowed upon me. They stated that they were the ones on my planet. It seems they were correct, but I was unaware of how close they would be. I, Gorgath, will continue to complete the tasks that are ahead of me."

The strange balls that were embedded into Gorgath's foot started to spin once more, and the others knew to take it as a sign that he was now coming toward them.

Immediately, Agent 4 lifted his hand and started to activate the blood power even before Gorgath had moved. It was a good thing he had done so, because in a flash, Gorgath was right in front of the blood wall having slammed into it.

"I will eliminate you both!" Gorgath declared, while attempting to break through.

# Chapter 1893 Friends and Enemies (Part 1)

There was an odd pair that had decided to travel together, decided wasn't quite the right word as it was more requested the two of them travel together, and at the same time, they weren't technically alone either.

"Did you really have to bring that with you?" Chris asked as they were walking through quite the busy wide street, full of life and all sorts of different people.

"This person is now a part of me, a part of my power," Peter said as he hit the large figure to his right. "You shouldn't worry too much either. Nearly no one knows what Laxmus looked like before, and especially in this form, not even those from the Red Vampires will recognize him. So stop your whining unless you want a fight."

There was no attempt to hide Laxmus' risen undead body, and it certainly was catching the attention of everyone around them. Still, due to those from the Bree family still being alive till this day, and still using their power, they just assumed that Peter was one of them, and had managed to tame the figure next to him.

Chris was the one that was in charge of this expedition, and currently, the two of them had travelled to one of the Graylash planets. These planets were far more peaceful compared to the ones near Earth where there was constant fighting.

At the same time, for Chris, it was odd seeing vampires and humans in the same place. Although there weren't many, there were those that just walked around out in the open. It made him think that maybe a life where the two of them lived side by side could work, after all, it was working here.

Just as he had that thought though, he also saw a vampire being kicked out of a restaurant establishment, the vampire looked upset but didn't retaliate, which made him have an odd mixed set of feelings.

At the same time due to the nonexistent fighting, the city, towns and land were well more normal. There was no living below sea level, there was no giant ship where people had to share their lives. There were just normal streets, shops, markets and more.

As for why they were here at the moment, it was because Chris wasn't exactly sure about where to go. He knew the general direction and knew it was past the planets the Graylash owned, so he thought maybe they would have an idea.

After all, the coordinates of such a place hadn't been shared with him, and he couldn't go back to Pure and ask either. It was a shame that the information of where they had gone hadn't been left in the lab, otherwise Logan could have given them an idea.

"So, where are we going right now?" Peter asked as he pushed past people, just walking forward with his arms crossed. If people didn't move out of his way he would just barge them and of course to them, Peter was like a solid, unmovable wall.

A couple of people had even fallen over but Peter didn't care either, stepping on or walking over them. They looked like they wanted to say something, but quickly changed their mind when they saw the body of Laxmus.

"Didn't you listen to anything I said?" Chris replied, and let out a big sigh, wishing he had been given anyone but Peter to do this task. "The Graylash have a detection system that should track every ship that comes and goes out of their space.

"Since I know the general direction, we just need to track a ship that seems like it's heading somewhere else, and then from there we can find the planets that Zero has gone to."

"I know that," Peter replied instantly, which caused a vein on Chris' head to pop out. Usually, Chris was quite a patient person, but his patience was wearing thin.

Especially since Chris had just had to pull a little girl out of Peter's path, otherwise she would have fallen over, and then had a foot on her face.

"I mean, where are we going now?" Peter asked.

"Now, Logan said once he informed the Graylash of what we wanted to do, someone wanted to meet us." Chris answered.

The two of them were on just a regular old Graylash planet. Each planet had several bases, and there was an army walking around in armour and such all over the place. They weren't anywhere special like the Graylash home base, which was why even Chris was wondering who would want to meet them.

"What is that!" A female wearing a black outfit with red curly hair came in front of the two and was pointing at Laxmus. "It… doesn't smell like a beast."

'Damn it, vampires can smell the difference between things. Why didn't I think of this, I knew this guy was going to bring us trouble.'

When Peter got close, just like he had been doing, he went to walk straight ahead. As his shoulders touched hers for a second there was resistance, but it didn't last long as the vampire fell to the floor.

"Wait!" The female said as she rolled out of the way before Peter's foot had crushed her, and quickly got back up. Not slowing down, the female could now just see the backs of the two heads walking off in the distance.

Just then, a young vampire man with grey hair had stepped out of one of the shops and joined the female by her side.

"What's wrong?" The male vampire asked.

"Lucas!" She said, "Those damned guys nearly stomped on me, and look!"

Pointing out, Lucas could see what she was pointing at, it certainly did seem interesting.

"Oh… it has a somewhat similar appearance to the Bloodsuckers of the past."

"Bloodsuckers?" She replied.

"Yes, you don't see them much these days… and it's classified as a taboo technique. Although they still exist, perhaps exist is not the right word. They still appear from time to time, but in order to keep up our image, all news, including to vampires ourselves is suppressed… but how is that one so tame."

When Lucas turned to his side, he could see his childhood friend Vanessa's eyes light up with fire, and her fist rose up by her chin. "Let's follow them. It looked like they were in a rush to go somewhere so let's follow them."

——

Eventually, Chris and Peter reached their destination. It was the centre of the city. A large open circular area with a fountain in the middle. Behind the fountain was the government building or the Graylash base of the city.

Even this place was full of people, children that were having fun playing in the water, running and chasing after each other. There were those that looked to be having a nice trip, couples and families.

'That reminds me, didn't Lucia return to one of the Graylash planets… not that she would be here.' Just as Peter had that thought, by the fountain sitting on the outer rim, he felt like he was imagining things, so he rubbed his eyes, but it looked like it was her.

"Peter!" Lucia shouted, hopping off from the rim, but she wasn't alone, there was another figure by her side around the same height as her, he was wearing a strange white and golden robe, and his face was hidden due to a metal mask covering the bottom of it.

"I didn't think I would be seeing you so soon." Lucia said, twiddling her fingers as she felt a little awkward as to how to act or what to do.

"Neither did I, why… why are you here?" Peter asked.

The response had disappointed her greatly, but Peter didn't seem to know, or act.

"I was asked to come here. When we were told who was coming, I had been asked, by our leader." Lucia replied and bowed down to the person next to her.

"It's nice to meet you both… especially you, Chris," Zinon stated, the current leader of the Graylash faction.

*****

# Chapter 1894 Friends and Enemies (Part 2)

The two vampires, Vanessa and Lucas, had caught up with Peter and Chris pretty fast. Although neither of them claimed to be strong vampires, otherwise they would have joined the vampire corps or something of that nature, they did pride themselves on their stealth skills. Which they often used as the two were quite nosy.

At the same time, due to the constant bickering that was going back and forth between the two, it felt like they didn't even have the time to notice they were being followed. Eventually, they entered the main fountain.

The two continued to hide themselves, and pretended to be a lovely couple that was just enjoying the fountain. They walked up to the outer rim of the fountain, while placing their hand in the water. At the same time, their ears were on high alert as they listened in to the conversation, and in the first few sentences they couldn't believe it.

"Did she just say what I think she said?" Vanessa asked.

"I heard it as well. They said he was the leader of the Graylash, that means Zinon Graylash is here right now." Lucas whispered back.

The Graylash leader was one that spent most of his time on his own planet with the high ranking officials in the Graylash family. Sure he made several public appearances on planets from time to time, but due to him being quite the popular leader, whenever there would be an event, it was almost impossible to even catch a proper glimpse of him.

"Who are these people, to know the leader of the Graylash family? Not just that, to actually get him to meet them here in secret!" Vanessa asked, still whispering but was finding it hard to keep her voice down due to the sheer shock of everything.

Immediately, she pulled out a strange device, it was the size of a nail, but upon pulling it, it grew larger until it was the size of her hand. A screen had appeared and immediately she started typing away.

"What are you doing?" Lucas asked.

"What do you mean, this is huge news. This is a scoop, there has to be a reason why he is here. We need to send this to someone!"

Right now, Vanessa was pinging the most famous reporter that she knew. BandV station. BandV station had a host that went by the name of AJ, and he had recently grown more in popularity after the Chained wedding. Being able to capture the other side of the story and the best of the best scenes.

A reporter as famous as him got hundreds of messages a day about potential scoops and usually he wouldn't bother looking through his messages but at the moment he was in a pretty sour mood. This was because there were constant reports going off about Pure base, Rein, being attacked and by Chris of all people.

Since he lived on the Graylash planets AJ wasn't the first one at the scene, so he was looking for the next big thing and was checking all of his incoming messages and that's when he saw Vanessa's message.

"What is this? This has to be something... I can feel it... this strange tingling sensation I'm getting all over my body!" Immediately AJ got out of his chair and using his superspeed ran to his ship, to fly off to the said Graylash planet.

It wouldn't take long, after all, AJ was a wealthy person and a fast ship was needed for his job in order to get to the next place as fast as possible.

----

After Zinon had somewhat introduced himself, Chris noticed that there was quite a gaze looking in his direction.

"Sorry." Zinon said. "But you should know why I am a bit unfriendly with those from Pure. We made the deal with your group so you would stay out of things. Yet you still used the dhampirs to meddle with us as a way to get around our agreement."

Chris couldn't deny that fact because it was true. Even though the Graylash family had signed a deal with Pure, they were doing the exact thing he said, whenever they would need something or to go after someone in the Graylash planets.

"However, I am not here for that. I am here because of a different matter." Zinon tensed up for a second, and he was silent for around a minute before he walked up to Chris, and looked up to him. Chris was a large man, a much larger man than Zinon, but he knew he had to be tough.

"I needed to ask you in person, are you, or do you know, the one that killed Owen Graylash," Zinon asked, not breaking eye contact and not looking away.

Vanessa opened up her mouth wide hearing these words and before she could gasp, Lucas placed his hand over it. Just then, a certain individual had run right by the fountain, at a great speed, and stood by their side.

"What did I miss?" AJ asked, as he opened up his secret camera in his jacket, twisted his hat that also had another camera on it, and began to film everything.

"You're not going to believe even if we told you." Lucas replied.

"I... I don't know." Chris replied. "I don't know who killed Owen. However, I doubt it was Zero, but I do have some information. These guys." Chris pointed toward Peter. "When they fought against the Dahmpir Queen.

"It seemed like she had a familiar with her, well not just one familiar, but a few of them and one of those was Genbu, the great turtle."

Hearing those words, Zinon felt like his eyes had gone bloodshot in that instant, and out of his control lightning was starting to spark a little off his clothes. This was because the turtle was somewhat of a legendary figure.

Owen had stayed with that turtle for a long time, there were even statues of it at the palace. Whoever owned it now, in his mind was the most likely culprit in Owen's death.

"I thank you. I needed to speak to you in person, I needed to see if your eyes were telling the truth. Hopefully, this will allow me to get to the truth. The truth of what happened to Owen Graylash."

Now AJ, who was standing at the side, couldn't believe it. This was a far bigger scoop than he could have imagined and to top it all off, he also recognized one of the figures, because they too were also at the Chained wedding event.

"I didn't go live... I didn't think it was going to be a huge scoop so I didn't go live." AJ said as he started to broadcast live. He didn't give the live stream any special title, because he feared that if they found out where they were and who the masked figure was, then there would be a rush of people at the square and he would lose his big story.

"I have to thank you both, for bringing this to my attention," AJ said. "I promise you will have enough to last you a lifetime... well at least a human's lifetime" he corrected himself.

"Okay." Zinon said smiling. "About your request, we can check things out inside the building behind us. Let's not waste any time."

The second Zinon turned around, he and a few others noticed something in the sky, right above the fountain.

"This..." Chris said.

"We've seen it before." Peter finished off the sentence, and so had Lucia seen it.

The white light that started to gather, that dispersed the clouds out of the area. It was getting larger and larger, until a white beam shot down, hitting the fountain.

Immediately, Zinon used his powers to create a lighting barrier, surrounding the white light energy just in case it was harmful to the public. However, the energy didn't spread, and soon it started to fade away, but It had left a certain individual standing in the fountain having destroyed the centrepiece.

"I, God Hinto, have come to destroy the God Slayer."

# Chapter 1895 Dad and daughter

For once, Quinn felt like he was on a type of break. In a sense that he wasn't rushing off to be anywhere. Because no matter how quickly he completed his job, he would still be either waiting for Chris to come back with some information, or for Alex to be done with making something with the crystals.

Which was why right now, he was just enjoying the public transport that would be used to head from one place to the next.

Quinn wasn't traveling alone on this trip, he had taken Minny with him. She was practically attached to his hip ever since he came back, even more so after Jessica and Lucia left, because now the only person she had was her father.

The two of them were on what was known as a space train. There were these beams of energy tracks that could be turned on from Green city, that would take a large group of people to the planets in the same solar system, and currently they were heading off to Mars.

Everything was so different to what Quinn remembered, in his time, one couldn't even live on the planets, yet they had all been terraformed and regulated to try and create perfect conditions similar to that on earth, so life could be sustainable there.

Even a train going through space was strange. At the moment, he was sitting in his seat, and looking at Minny who was staring out of the window opposite her.

"It's so pretty outside, everything is so pretty." Minny said with a giant smile on her face. He was happy that she was happy.

After hearing her story, with how she had the shadow taken away from her Quinn felt partly guilty. She should have never gone through something like that. Yet she had done so, and it was because of him.

Even though Quinn had originally given her the shadow powers so she could protect him whenever possible, it had somewhat backfired on him.

'I wonder, why did Bliss want me away from everything?' Quinn thought. 'I thought I understood her point, but in the end I still came back. Doesn't she have the ability to see the future? So surely she should have known that I would come back.'

Quinn was starting to imagine that maybe it was Bliss's plan. To face against other celestials in order for him to grow and gain more power, if she was really on the side of humans, then it would make sense.

It lined up with what Sil said as well. In how he had seen celestials attacking Earth. If that was the case then maybe everything Quinn experienced would be for the future.

"Dad, stop thinking about all that stuff, we are on holiday!" Minny said.

The small vampire was right, and for Quinn it should be a time for him to relax his mind. Just then down the alleyway, there was a train attendant pushing a trolly with a bunch of snacks and more.

"Would you like anything from the cart, little miss?" The woman smiled.

"Yes yes, I am on holiday so my dad will get me as much juice as I want." Minny replied.

Now Quinn knew why she was claiming that it was a holiday, it was an excuse for her to have as many juice boxes as she liked.

When bringing out the juices from out of the tray. There was a specific one that was wrapped in metal and had a picture of a blood droplet in the top corner. Minny recognized it well and pointed.

The reaction from the attendant wasn't the best, even though she was trying to keep her composure, Quinn could hear her heartbeat change as she grabbed the juice and placed it on the table quickly moving her hand.

"I hope you have a nice day." The woman said with a shaky voice as she continued going down the rest of the train.

'This is another problem that won't be solved overnight. It's quite unbelievable that after a 1000 years of humans knowing that vampires exist that the relationship between the two are like this. Is there a way to solve this?' Quinn thought.

Eventually, the train had come to an end, and lifting Minny up, Quinn carried her on his shoulders. She wasn't tired, Minny was a strong vampire and had the stamina of one, but she enjoyed the tender moments like this.

When exiting from the train though, once again Quinn could see the attendant talking with the others with their hands covering their mouths and although he couldn't see. He could hear.

"I can't believe she is a vampire! The poor thing."

"Poor thing? That thing is just a monster that uses our blood to survive. I can't believe we even take clients like that on the train. I heard the young ones can't even control themselves, what would they do if they attacked everyone on the train.

"If it was up to me, I would throw them off the train and into space."

The one speaking was a male attendant, and although the females somewhat agreed they didn't feel that strongly against such a thing. The man let out his frustration with a large sigh, and when he turned around, he could see Quinn standing there and in his hand was a little girl.

"Usually I would let things pass by." Quinn said. "But I have had a chance to view the world. You are brave enough to say those words when you think others can't hear you, and you may think that they do no harm but they have angered me greatly.

"I am hoping to create a better world for my daughter to live in, and while there are people like you in this world that isn't possible, which is why I'm going to give you one order."

Quinn's eyes started to glow red and he looked directly at the man.

"Since you have a cruel and dirty mouth, I think this will teach you a lesson. You are not to say a word to anyone for an entire year."

At the same time, Quinn had his hand pressed on the man's shoulder, the standard Qi that everyone had learned to avoid the influence skill wasn't working, he had taken it away.

What Quinn had used was the influence skill, but it had been a while since he had used it in this way. Usually he would use it to just get information. It was very rare he could give orders, and he could only do so if they were mentally weak among other things.

The person in front of him was no one special. Otherwise they would have never been in a job like so. Honestly Quinn wasn't even sure if this would work, but he knew it would at least work for a while.

After saying these words, the man attempted to say something, but something in his head had caused his mouth to stay shut. He looked to the two by his side and attempted to talk again, shaking them, greatly.

Then, when turning around to try and get the person to reverse what had been done to him, both Quinn and Minny were away. After going through a few checks here and there, the two of them were now at the central Mars train station.

It was largely open and flourishing as people came in and out, but what was strange to see as before was the walls and different Zones that had been built everywhere.

"Hey, we're on a new planet, let's go to a fun fair, and go on rides and drink more juices!" Minny shouted in joy and was jumping up and down.

Quinn had set up a meeting with Andy, or at least informed him he was coming, but there was no set time, so he believed that maybe he could treat Minny to those things, but as they walked through the exit, there were many people holding up signs with several names on them.

That's when Quinn spotted a particular sign amongst the crowd that had the words BB on it.

'Are they here for me… and how do they know that name, or is it just a coincidence?' Quinn thought.

******

# Chapter 1896 Favour for me

The letters on the sign were written clearly, they were large and there were only the BB's, nothing else. When looking at the said person though, it was a male in a suit. Someone that Quinn didn't recognise at all.

He tried to sense the energy coming from him, from a distance. There was no need to make a scene, definitely not in a train station where there were people around and there was always the worry of Minny.

'Why? I thought I could relax a bit. After that reaction from Yongbu and not going back into the celestial space... Why can't those damned gods just leave me alone.' Quinn thought.

However, he was unable to sense any celestial energy, but from meeting Bliss he knew they could hide it quite well. The only other way to confirm it was if Quinn was able to touch the person. This was the easiest and most direct way for him to sense energy.

Walking over, Quinn took Minny off his shoulders and started to hold her hand, he brought her in close to him, and was careful and on guard every step of the way as he walked toward this person, thinking about what to say or what to do.

After a few steps, another man suddenly appeared right in front of him.

"Hello there Sir!" The man said with a large bow. This man was in black leathers that looked more like a person that was ready for combat, unlike the other people around the area. "I have been directed to escort the two of you to the main base to meet with Leader Andy immediately."

So focused on the other person holding up the sign, he hadn't noticed the man coming form his right, and out from the side. When Quinn turned to look at the man holding up the sign, he had disappeared.

'I guess... he found the person he was looking for and that sign wasn't for me after all.' Quinn told himself. Not really believing his own words.

"I guess I should deal with this first." Quinn said, as he walked with the man and the two of them headed off toward a small space ship together. After seating up, it was time for them to head over to see Andy.

"The leader has told me to treat the two of you like royalty, so if there is anything the two of you need please don't hesitate to ask. I am known as Baron Neil." The gentleman introduced himself.

Quinn didn't say much, his mind was on other things, but Neil was being a good host. As they flew over, he was describing the places, the improvements, and the changes that had been going on on Mars.

It seemed like the vampire corps was doing a lot of things around the other planets. Since the dhampirs and Pure's concentration was more so on the next election and wished to take over the Green's, it allowed the vampire corps to do more than it usually would have done.

However, when going over a certain part, there was a destroyed wall, several destroyed buildings as well, and it looked like a small town had been destroyed.

"What happened there?" Minny asked.

Neil nervously chuckled a little bit. Not really sure how to answear such a young vampire without worrying her too much.

"Mars has been under Horde attacks from beasts for a while now. The waves and attacks have been getting slightly bigger each time. Unfortunately, this town had experienced quite a high level wave.

"They didn't have the power to defend from the attack. Still, everyone was able to get out safely, so there is no need to worry about that." Neil explained.

It was just as Logan had said, Mars was experiencing a beast problem, but according to Logan it wasn't just Mars it was other planets as well. In truth, it was happening to all the humans who were on the beast planets that were discovered during the first Dalki war.

Quinn had little sympathy for humans in a way, because they were the invaders, but in this case it was a different matter. The beasts were actively attacking areas and working together. It was almost as if in the beasts' minds they were in war with the humans over territory on the planet.

In the end, they had made it to a large black Victorian style place. There were castle walls, and inside those walls there were barracks, training grounds, and there was a large square shaped building. It wasn't quite a castle, but it did remind Quinn of the vampire castles in the past.

This was the main vampire corps base that was located on Mars, and currently where Andy presently would be. The spaceship flew over most of the place, eventually heading around the back of the main base where there was a large courtyard of flowers and grass, but there was also a circular centerpiece that was designed for a few spaceships to land now and then.

Surprisingly, waiting for them just where the landing spot was, was Andy himself. As they got off the ship, Quinn smiled towards Andy.

The two of them didn't get off on the perfect foot together when they had met, but Quinn had an increase in celestial points at one point, and he was pretty sure it was because Andy had gone through with his request, of sacrificing blood to a statue.

"Thank you for you help Neil. I can take it over form here." Andy stated.

The three of them walked through the courtyard that was quite a pretty sight, it was full of flowers, nicely cut grass and other things. It was a place where Minny was able to enjoy herself as she looked at everything on display and also allowed for the two of them to talk freely, in peace.

"Logan stated that you had something to speak to me about, and since it's you, I assumed it was important. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to come to you as we have had our own problems to deal with." Andy explained.

"I saw." Quinn replied. "The beast waves."

"Correct." Andy sighed. "However, they haven't been the only problem we have been dealing with. I'm sure you know about the incident with Pure's Rein, correct?"

Quinn of course knew about it, because he saw the whole thing develop out. It had also only been a couple of days since the development, of what had occurred and the news channels were just catching up with what had occurred.

"You see, now that the main base of Pure has been destroyed, there are many of those that are leaving and looking for protection. Not everyone can migrate to Earth, so that means they have been coming to our place as well.

"However, those from Pure don't exactly like that we are the ones that are helping them in the end. I'm sure you understand the difficulties. It has been difficult inside our towns and cities and outside as well."

Quinn didn't really think about that. But perhaps this situation and difficult time would make it so the two sides would be forced to live together.

"Anyway, please, go ahead with your request."

"I would like you to take me to your father again. Your blood is the only thing that can wake him up, and I believe I have a way to re-energize him and power him again."

Hearing these words, an intense look had appeared on Andy's face.

"I'm sorry, but even if you have found a way to prolong his life or re-energize him, I feel like there Is no need for him to come back. He would only be in pain, and would be obsessed with his revenge like he was before.

"I do not want my father to suffer anymore."

"I understand." Quinn said. "But your father asked me for a favor, and I plan to complete it. I wish for him to be there, and for us to enjoy the memories."

"You mean..

"That's right, I plan to kill the dhampir Queen, so please take me to your father."

Andy paused for second as he thought about everything being said, and then smiled. He thought he could go up against Quinn before, but he had lost last time and felt like he would lose this time as well.

"Very well, I will take you to see my father, but only after the problem is resolved here, if you can help me with that, then I will let you see my father." Andy relief.

*****

# Chapter 1897 Protecting Mars (Part 1)

In Quinn's mind it was a fair deal. Due to the position that Andy was in, he couldn't just leave his post. Being in charge of a large organization in the past had taught Quinn that, and if someone had asked him the same things his response would have been similar.

Although, in the past he had one of the best men in the world helping him out… and the mystery of what happened to him, and where he was or where he went was still unknown.

"So what do you want me to do, or when do we get to work?" Quinn asked.

Andy was surprised that Quinn was so eager to get into action. At the same time, he never thought that he would get such help from such a person. In his mind, he was trying to weigh Quinn's strength and in doing so figuring out how exactly he could help.

"I still have a lot to do in the bases themselves like I said, so honestly we haven't been able to find out why the waves of beasts have become more frequent and worse, in terms of power.

"The land that is open on the outside, less and less travelers are going out there. Maybe I could organize a team for you to try to find the cause of this."

For Quinn, it didn't matter the reason, but the solution. Hordes of beasts came from Nest crystals, so if he was to find the nest crystals and get rid of them that would be his answer.

"Don't get rid of all the nest crystals." Andy stated as he could tell what the other was thinking. "I don't know what it was like during your time, but the use of Beast crystal energy is immense for us.

"They power nearly everything and our everyday things. Without beasts, not just this planet but other planets will really struggle. We just want the tier of beasts to lessen so our cities and manpower can handle it."

The task might seem somewhat impossible, Andy knew that, but this was the great hero they were talking about. Solving this problem would be nothing compared to the great Dalki.

One of Andy's 100 squad commanders had been called in. It was one that was a similar rank of Mitchell, who had also stayed behind in Green city for now, had come to collect Quinn.

There were quite a few people that knew who Quinn was in the higher ranks of the Vampire corps, because there were those that had travelled with Mitchell at that time, and they had seen everything.

However, Quinn's return was never spread due to the fear and power shifting it might cause. Still, those worries from before were dwindling. Dhampir attacks were practically unheard of at the moment, and Pure had been dealt a huge blow that most thought they would never be able to recover from.

Either way, the man in front of them, with short spiked up hair and a beret hat, was Arad Buckley.

"It's a pleasure to meet you sir!" Arad bowed down and lifted his head saluting Quinn, while then pointing to those that were by his side. "Andy has told me to treat you with the utmost respect as you are our honoured guest.

"He has also explained that you will be going out to try and help us in finding out the reason for the Beast waves. I thank you for your cooperation."

The men couldn't help but look at Quinn up and down. His skin was crystal clear, his appearance was one of a calm face, and he was quite the looker. None of those in the vampire corps could even imagine that this person in front of them was able to be much help.

'He must be some type of high ranking official in the Green City that happens to be a vampire or something. Coming along to show that they have attempted to help.'

A lot of vampires were critical of those that lived in Green City. Because the vampire corps was the place where vampires were meant to be. Humans were accepted but in the corps unit itself it was 90 percent vampires.

Those that joined Green City or ran off to the Graylash planets were often criticized in the vampire corps for not trying to fight and support their own kind. They felt that even the Red Vampires had more backbone.

At the same time, they had always felt that the vampire corps did a lot more to help Green City, then they did to help them. Once in a while token gestures such as Jake Green or people like this that were in front of them would be sent out for help, but it wasn't enough.

On top of that, there was one thing that was concerning for them all, and that was the fact that there was a young vampire girl that was travelling with the man and holding onto his leg.

"Erghh… Sir, will she also be coming along with us?" One of the men asked.

Arad wasn't too sure and looked at Quinn for an answer. Although Andy had told him that his name was Buinn, so no one in the room at the moment was aware of who he was.F

"She will be coming with us, but don't worry about her. I hear she is quite capable of handling herself, and if worst comes to worst I will protect her. Each of you can be concerned with protecting your own life." Quinn answered.

Since that matter was somewhat resolved, although from the look on the others' faces they couldn't believe it, Arad decided to continue.

'If that young girl dies then we're the ones that are going to get all of the blame for this!' One of them inwardly complained, and it wasn't too far off from the others' thoughts. Why in a mission like this had a little vampire been asked to come along.

"These people here are my best men from my hundred man squad. I would say with all of us together we are even capable of taking out a demon tier beast if we were to come across one."

"Have you ever fought against a demon tier beast?" Quinn asked.

"No we have not!" Liam was the one who answered who looked the youngest of the vampires in the squad.

Hearing the answer Quinn shook his head slightly, because he knew anyone who fought against a demon tier beast would never say that. Their strength varied greatly. At one point, the world's strongest were gathered to take on a demon tier beast.

Then there was the dragon, all of the vampires including some of the originals had been woken up to attempt to take that down, but the more Quinn thought about it, he assumed the Dragon had to be at the Godslayer level rather than the Demon tier level. It was just that his system was unable to recognize such things before.

"Have you?" Liam asked. "Have you ever taken on a demon tier beast?"

The other corps members were smirking hearing the question asked. It was fair for him to criticize their work but not hear it from the others. Quinn's silence on the matter just made the others more confident expecting that Buinn was just all talk.

Just as the group were getting ready to leave, a sound had been heard throughout the building. A constant alarm that was going off.

"What is that?" Quinn asked.

"It's the beast waves… it means they're attacking right now." Arad replied with his eyebrows furrowed inward. "At a time like this, this is why we have to complete our mission."

The group all looked frustrated, and started to continue to pack their supplies.

"What are you doing?" Quinn asked. "Shouldn't we go help get rid of the wave?"

"Andy stated that no matter what was to occur we were to go with you and help complete this task." Arad replied.

"Yes, but he also said that you were to assist me at all times right. Well then, I will be going to the front line to fight off the wave, so you have no choice but to come." Quinn replied, as he walked away, and started to head towards the wall.

For a second, the rest of the group looked at each other, and started to regret their thoughts from before. Even if he was weak, he surely wasn't spineless and thought about what they wanted.

"That man… is not bad." Liam smiled.

****

# Chapter 1898 Protecting Mars (Part 2)

There had been a lot on Andy's mind ever since that day. The day where he had met his father once more. He had taken over the Vampire Corps unit for a while now, and yet the whole world had been at a stalemate of sorts.

With no group able to progress in what they truly wanted to do. They fought, helped, and protected those that they wished to protect, but Andy had never been able to complete his father's goal, nor had he changed the way the world was.

In the end, no matter how hard he tried, he just wasn't that type of person. Yet, when Quinn had returned, the first thing he had done was take out the Chained. It was a world changing event, and it was why Andy had changed his mind and had chosen to support such a person, which was what he was doing right now.

After the alarm sounded due to the incoming wave, Andy was on the move. This was because according to the report, it was the biggest wave of beasts they had ever experienced.

Usually, the beasts would start coming from low tiers to higher tiers, hitting the wall in different areas. This was what had happened before, but according to the report, not only was this the highest tier wave they had experienced, with there being higher tiers than ever, it was also the largest wave, and it looked like beasts were going to attack the entirety of the west wall at once.

This was why Andy himself had decided to move, and the whole of the Vampire Corps had been mobilized. There were now around five thousand Vampire Corps members across the wall. Some of them on top, but the majority of them were on the ground in front of the wall of the city

Andy stood in front of them all facing away. They were in a grass-like field that went on for miles. The area had been cleared for fights like this. This way, the beasts had nowhere to hide and their attacks could hit them freely.

However, in the distance the vampires could hear the rumbling from far away. Their sensitive ears could pick it up, and they were just waiting to get the first glimpse of the beast wave. To them it felt like they were about to have a war, going into battle for Mars, in a fight between the vampires and the beasts.

"Everyone, remember why we fight!" Andy shouted out loud so all of the vampires across the wall could hear. "Remember who we are protecting behind these walls. Remember why we chose to do this, why you chose to become a member of the Vampire Corps unit!

"For me, it's the same, because the people that I want to protect are right here in front of me!"

The members of the Vampire Corps didn't expect to hear this answer from Andy, and the unexpectedness had brought a smile to their faces.

"I am standing here today, because I don't want to say goodbye to any of my brothers and sisters that have chosen to fight by my side. Which is why I will fight, to make sure I don't have to say goodbye to any of you. So don't disappoint me!"

A gigantic cheer was heard from each of the members as they raised their hands in the air. It could be heard by those that were within the city. Aware of what was going on outside right now.

The humans, the vampires, all of them were putting hope into the Vampire Corps being able to successfully defend them. They had heard the news of what had happened to some of the towns recently. A city had yet to fall on Mars, but there was always a first.

Finally, the vampires could now see the wave of beasts that were coming towards them, and it was worse than any of them could imagine. Looking from one side of the other, it was impossible to even see the end of the line of beasts that were heading their way.

The beasts themselves were of all different kinds, some of them slithered on the ground like snakes, some ran on all fours, some ran on claws and even some flew in the sky. There was a mixture of types everywhere. On top of all that, the level of the beasts and the energy readings from them was off the charts for what they had seen before.

There were no lower tier beasts than that of Emperor tier beasts that were coming towards them. In total, there looked to be around 15,000 beasts of all different tiers. There were hundreds of Demi-god tier beasts by the looks of it, and worst of all there was even a single Demon tier beast at the back.

It was ginormous, looking like that of a giant slug, with four pointed large leg-like claws sticking out from its back. It had eyes that went down its front that was lifted outright, big and yellow.

Honestly, even Andy was taken back by this. He somewhat expected the number of Demi-god tier beasts but hadn't expected to see a Demon tier.

'How can this be? When using Logan's device, there was no Demon tier beast energy reading. Does that mean one had been born on this planet naturally, but how is that even possible.'

The worst part of it all, was that Andy would have to face the thing. Although he was confident he could take it down, it would mean he would be unable to help the others as much. After saying these words he felt like a fool.

"Sir, worry not, we are also here to help!"

Turning around, Andy could see it was Arad, and the ten others he had sent off.

"What are you doing here?" Andy asked.

"Don't ask why we are here, it would be foolish of us not to help." Arad replied.

Andy shook his head because his question wasn't directed at Arad.

"No, what are you doing here?" Andy asked again, looking at Quinn who was at the back of the group.

He walked forward and stood right by Andy's side, placing his hand on his shoulder.

"I said that I would help, and that includes this as well."

Seeing how Quinn was so easily able to place his hand on Andy's shoulder and Andy giving no pushback was amazing to all of those watching. It made them reconsider the relationship between the two, and in that moment, Andy had done something he never thought he would do in his life before.

"Please… can you help me… help me protect all of these people?" Andy asked.

Before, while in the room, he was too afraid to ask, and somewhat felt like he was blackmailing Quinn into helping him, but now in this moment he realized, why didn't he just ask for help?

"Of course." Quinn replied. "Tell everyone to make a small cut on their hand, and I will get rid of this trouble for you."

Andy's eyes lit up, with Quinn by his side he thought they might be able to do this, and although he had made a weird request, Andy was willing to listen to him.

"Everyone, in order to make our bond stronger, and start this battle right, I want you to make a small cut on your hand! The first wound on our bodies will not be made by the enemy." Although Andy had made this up, his words were convincing.

Everyone complied, making a small cut on their hand and the blood went to drop on the floor, but as it did, it stopped midair.

"What is going on, why is the blood floating?" they started to ask.

When Andy turned to Quinn, his eyes were glowing red.

"Every single person here will be of help to get rid of the wave, I will make sure of that."

Quinn's aura erupted directly around him, making him look like a large flame. The vampires had never seen such strong aura before.

Soon after that, the aura started to turn and form shapes, that of swords. Hundreds of swords were being made, thousands of swords, and they were being spread out all across the wall far and wide. After that, the blood that had been spilt by the Vampire Corps was rising, and that power was being used to add to the blades, to create even more weapons for use.

It was a sight that none of them had ever seen before as they looked up in the sky and it was filled with Blood swords.

'This power…'

"There is a reason why I have the title of Ruler of Blood." Quinn smiled as he threw his hands forward. Immediately, all of the blood aura swords had gone out towards the beasts. They had been propelled like bullets and smashed into the wall of beasts.

The beasts fell to the ground as the swords went through their heads and continued to fly about. Quinn continued to use the swords, not to just take out the weaker beasts, but then used the aura to take out the larger beasts as well, as the swords were then used to target them.

In just around 10 seconds, nearly all of the beast had fallen to the floor and were dead, while the blood aura swords had dissipated as their energy was used up.

Still there was one more, and it was then that Quinn had made a cut on his own hand. His celestial blood started to gather and he began to form it into a different shape. It soon had taken on the shape of a spear.

It was hardened, but beaming with red celestial power. Running forward slightly, Quinn then hurled it from where he was, and a delayed bang was heard. There were two, one from when Quinn had thrown the spear, and the other, from when it had completely ripped half of the Demon tier's beast body off, disappearing into nothing.

The threat was gone, the threat was no more, and it had all been the work of one person.

"I hope they won't cause you any more problems." Quinn said as he turned around. Everyone was left with their mouths wide open, frozen in place. Not a single word was spoken, and that included Andy.

"How!!!!" Liam shouted. " How can you have that much power? How can you have so much power and we have never heard of or seen you. Who are you and where were you!!"

A mixed set of feelings were coming over Liam that he didn't really know to react. If such a person existed why didn't they help the vampires out before, and at the same time they were thankful for just being saved right now.

"There is no reason to hide it anymore." Andy stated. "The world needs to know of your accomplishments. The world needs to know what you have done, and what you are still doing for them. This, everyone, is the Great Hero of the past, and still our hero now, Quinn Talen!" Andy shouted at the top of his lungs for everyone to hear.

# Chapter 1899 Spider Blood

The Vampire Corps were already finding it hard to process what they had just seen. The amount of blood aura that had been used to create the swords in the first place, the power, and how they were used with such fine blood control to take out the army of beasts.

Since most of them were vampires, with a few subclasses here and there, they knew how impressive such a feat was, how impossible it was to have that level of blood control or aura that had been used.

Then, there was the large spear that had been used to destroy the Demon tier beast in a single hit. Right now, they knew they were looking at someone beyond that of a vampire.

All of that was going through the Corps members heads as they were told one thing. That the person in front of them was the legendary Quinn Talen.

At first they thought that Andy was playing a joke on them all. It just seemed so impossible and even the figure Quinn in the past and his feats seemed impossible for many of them as well.

However, when thinking about it a bit more, it was the only thing that would explain the situation, why he had so much power, and why someone was on such good terms with Andy.

"The Hero, is that really Quinn Talen?"

"I mean, it has to be right, only the hero could do something like that. He's the only vampire with such strength."

"But we were told that he died a 1000 years ago, and he hasn't appeared since, so why is he here now?"

It seemed a lot of them had their suspicions about Quinn and he could understand why, if he was in their shoes he probably would be thinking the same thing. For a second, Quinn turned to look at Andy who gave an awkward smile back.

Andy was unsure what the reaction would be, outing him in public like that and doing so before talking it over with Quinn. Judging by the aura around him though, Quinn seemed to take it well.

'One day or another it was going to come out, and with the Red Vampires now working for us, the dhampirs are next to nothing. There isn't much to be worried about anymore, with the truth of me being returned… I just wonder what the reaction will be from now on.'

While thinking all of this, Quinn had used his aura to create a set of claws around his fingers. Then. Grabbing his long hair that went down to around his waist, he started to slash and cut at it, making it shorter.

He was practically giving himself a very rough haircut in front of everyone that was there. After slashing his hair a few times, it started to curl up a bit like it had done in the past, and a few more seconds later, Quinn's hair was now just down to his shoulders.

"I needed that for a while now, but I thought the new look wasn't so much of a bad thing." Quinn stated.

Now with his haircut the vampires were getting a second look at the person in front of him. His hair was around the same length as it was before, making him look more like the statue, the statues that they all knew well.

"They look really similar, I mean they don't look exactly the same, there are few changes here and there but it's been so long."

"Plus, statues aren't going to look exactly like the orginal right?"

"Maybe it's just a look alike."

"With that much power, why are you in denial about everything so much?"

There was a stir brewing between them all, about whether or not this was the real Quinn, and soon questions started to pop in their minds, that if this was the real Quinn then what happened to him, where had he been this entire time.

Seeing how the situation was beginning to turn slightly and Quinn could see that there would be a bombardment of questions. He turned to Andy.

"You know what." Quinn said, as he summoned his shadow, and took Minny out of it. He had placed her inside during the fight, since it was so sudden. She soon hopped onto his back after and the other vampires seeing the shadow just started talking more.

"Look… he even has the shadow ability. Only Quinn or the guardians have the shadow ability, he looks like Quinn, is as strong as Quinn, and has the shadow like Quinn as well… it has to be him."

"Yeah and it looks like he has a kid as well. Maybe that's why he went into hiding for so long, to run off with the love of his life."

Now it was seriously getting strange, so once again Quinn placed his hand on Andy's shoulder. "I will leave this all to you. I think it is better for me to solve this problem on my own. Otherwise, the others will just slow me down.

"I hope all of this can be cleared by the time I get back, and I also hope that it won't take too long."

Entering his shadow on the ground, Quinn started to use his shadow travel to explore the various areas of Mars. He didn't have his wings at the moment, so it was the next best thing to get out of the area.

After disappearing off in the distance it left Andy just shaking his head.

"I guess I was the one that outed him, so I should be the one to deal with the consequences."

While travelling through his shadow, Quinn did make a quick stop at the Demon tier beast he had killed, and went ahead and grabbed its crystal. Although he was unsure how strong it was or what skill the beast had possessed due to it dying quickly, its crystal could still be used for repairs if needed, and if Jake Green came back empty handed.

After going out in the distance for a while, and toward where the beasts were heading from, Quinn noticed something that was different compared to before. In the past, there would be countless beasts in certain areas, but here it was a wasteland, just plant life, insects and so on, but no deadly beasts.

Eventually, Quinn decided to stop and come out from his shadow. Even if he was to travel at full speed it would take him a while to head around the entirety of Mars.

'It's a good thing that I have a lot of experience when it comes to dealing with Nest crystals thanks to that little journey I had with Sil. But how would I find such a thing?'

While thinking about this, an idea popped into Quinn's head… something that might just work. Sitting down on the grass, crossing his legs, the vampire celestial made a cut on his hand. He also activated the celestial energy as he usually would have done. When the blood dripped onto the ground, it slowly started to spread out.

This looked similar to that of the blood forest skill that Quinn would use. The blood spread out on the ground in all directions, and it looked like a spiderweb of sorts made out of blood was appearing from Quinn.

The blood continued to flow out from his body, and while doing so it was spreading out, going further and further, the blood was being spread out as thin as possible while it was travelling in all sorts of different directions.

'I can control my blood well, and since it has my celestial energy in it, when it touches or gets close to the Nest crystal I should know.'

Quinn continued to do this, and as his blood spread out more and more, his celestial points were being used up, and his health was dropping slightly, but then, finally he had found something, an energy similar to that of the Nest crystal.

The thread of blood that had touched the crystal was lighting up, going right back to where Quinn was. But soon after that, several other threads started to light up as well, near the area where the Nest crystal was at.

'What is this?' Quinn thought. As it was something he had never experienced before.
