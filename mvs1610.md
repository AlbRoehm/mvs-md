# Chapter 1610: Influence Mayhem
With the title of Ruler of Blood Quinn had gained, he now had an infinite amount of blood control. Quinn was able to feel vampires from a far distance. The problem was that it was pretty useless if the vampires were relatively far away since he could only tell in a vague sense where they were.

It also seemed like he couldn't sense them well unless they used their blood aura.

In a way, it reminded Quinn of the connection he would have with his subclass vampires. However, he preferred his connection from before because he could know if the others were safe.

'Now that he is in front of me, I can feel the energy from him. I couldn't feel it from far away. Is it because the celestial energy isn't that strong? Maybe I can use this to my advantage?'

Quinn had said his words loudly when talking about the celestial energy Thinking that it might provoke a reaction from Tikker in front of him, but there was no such thing other than an odd look as if Quinn was crazy.

Which meant he most likely didn't even know about the new energy in his body. Or at least didn't know what it really was.

"You're a vampire, right, and you know about us? Where is Hannah? Are you from her group?" Tikker asked. "I can't believe that wench won't even come and visit me herself. She goes and sends one of her goons. No wonder I was sent to lead this task force…I swear to join the vampire corps.."

"I am not with them," Quinn answered. "I know of you red vampires, and I could sense your energy, so I came over here. I was wondering something, though, where exactly were you heading?"

Tikker and the other vampires laughed at this comment. Sensing energy, it wasn't really something that many vampires could do. Tikker couldn't. Otherwise, he would have been able to sense the energy inside of Quinn, but there was a reason for Quinn's question.

When coming towards him, he was wondering why of all things, did it seem like the vampires were heading towards the town, rather than the meeting location, the cave that was a little away.

"Haha, what are you some type of vampire detective?" Tikker laughed. "Hey, you like blood, right? Why don't you come down to the town with us because you're about to see blood both."

The vampires started to move, which was partly what Quinn was worried about. He was sure that Tikker knew what state the town was in. It was a good opportunity for a full attack on humans.

Because any deaths, they could play it off as the Traveller's fault.

"I guess for those that are good; there are also those who are bad," Quinn said as he looked directly at all of them with his eyes glowing red. "You know, I realised something, my influence skill doesn't seem to work against humans due to the Qi they have protecting their brain.

"Usually, the skill is less effective against vampires, but you see, I'm a little different from them, and I'm looking for some of my questions to be answered. Kneel." Quinn ordered.

The knees of the vampires hitting the floor were heard as something had overcome their body, but one was left standing, and that was Tikker himself.

"What are you guys doing? Are you playing some joke on me!' Tikker stated, clearly a bit frightened at what had just happened.

"Well, now that's a shame. Why hasn't it worked on you?" Quinn thought as he walked closer towards Ticker. "You were the one that I had the most questions for."

Frightened, that was when Tikker had covered his hand in red aura, making a large claw. The red aura was shaped similar to his hands, but was twice the size of it. Shoving it forward, he tried to attack Quinn, who was able to quickly move his head away, and grabbed onto Tikker's wrist.

Soon the red aura started to fade, and his special red aura had gone away.

'He is suppressing my red aura…but how?' Tikker was beyond confused. Never had he seen or heard of someone capable of doing such a thing in his life.

"You know, I was actually planning just to ask you some questions, maybe find some things out about what a dedicated follower was, but I had a gut feeling that maybe you were heading to the town. I was hoping it wouldn't be the case. That I could leave you be. Now my influence skill won't work on you. I'm going to have to do things a bit differently."

Letting go of his hand, Quinn jumped back.

"Everyone, attack the man with the T on his head," Quinn ordered

Immediately, the other vampires that were on the ground had gone towards their leader. Their faces showed that it was clearly against their will to do this, but they fired blood swipes towards him.

"What are you guys doing? Why are you listening to him!" Tikker shouted. "He can't have control over you guys; that's impossible!"

Although the vampires were attacking their leader, it looked quite sloppy. It seemed that his influence skill, even as strong as it was, didn't allow him to have complete control.

"If you want me to tell them to stop, then tell me. Who gave you your real marking. Who is the leader of the Red vamps? What are you planning to use the red heart for? Agree to answer the rest of my question, but that will be a good start." Quinn demanded.

He was hoping that this might convince Tikker. However, soon getting frustrated, Tikker summoned the red aura and stabbed his own ally right through the chest. It was causing blood to fill the vampire's mouth, and he fell to the ground dead.

"If I tell you any of that crap, then I'm dead!" Tikker shouted as he continued to go after the others. "How dare you betray me? He shouted, slicing towards the neck of another vampire, ripping it out and blood pouring.

Tikker was no longer trying to avoid their attacks, and it looked like he wasn't holding back either, even against his allies.

Going after the next Red vampire, Tikker was clearly faster and on a different level compared to them. He had even used the red aura to extend the claw he had on his hand. Just before the aura could pierce the eyes of another alley, a single blood swipe had hit him in the body, sending him flying back and through the trees.

"I'm sorry, but if he can't answer my questions, then I'm going to need some of you guys alive," Quinn said, looking at the three that had survived. "Stay out of the fight, stand back, and don't die." Were the orders Quinn gave.

Quinn had somewhat held back in his blood aura attack, but looking in the direction where Tikker was he could tell that the fight wasn't over yet. No, Quinn didn't want it to be; he needed to figure out just what a dedicated follower was capable of.

"You! You!" Tikker shouted from the other side as he walked back, looking in perfect condition, not a mark on his body. This Quinn had found strange. Even if he did hold back, it should have done something.

"Are you the one that he warned us about! You have to be! Well, if that's the case, then I won't have to worry about tearing you to shreds!" Ripping off his shirt with his hands, unearth a red marking that could be seen on his chest. It was large, but it also was the same design as the one on Hanna's thigh. Yet Quinn knew this wasn't just a tattoo.

A single eye with a pair of bat-like wings on top of its head. Soon, it started to glow, lighting up and infusing a power into Tikker. His body began to change. Seeing this whole scene playout reminded Quinn a lot of his fight with Laxman.

*****

# Chapter 1611: What Is This Energy
Although the transformation reminded Quinn of when he fought against Laxmus, what was standing in front of him didn't quite look like what Laxmus had done or become when he had finished transforming.

Tikker's body had grown more significant like that of a bloodsucker. His muscles also bulged, being tight to his skin. However, the skin was now black making certain features stand out more. For one, the red eyes against the black skin contrast, and then, there was the large red marking that was still visible on its body.,

There were no wings that had formed, but its mouth looked to have been a melted mess as there were no longer any lips or edges, but just teeth that would show through gaps here and there.

"I really hope when I use my own celestial energy that I don't look that ugly," Quinn commented. "I mean, I didn't right, but maybe the transformation will get worse the more energy I have."

Tikker wasted no time, opening its mouth and gathering his vampire aura. A small red ball of energy grew in size, and soon throwing his head forward, the energy beam went straight towards Quinn.

'Hmm, I can tell that I can't control this blood energy. So it looks like if blood aura has the powers of a celestial, I can't do anything to it. It's the same with the Dhampirs as well. It's almost as if I'm a god of the vampires but nothing else. I would probably have a hard time controlling the aura of subclasses as well. Is it because my own body's constitution is closest to theirs?'

While thinking of all of this, Quinn readied one of his hands, opening its palm. The next second, a large energy force came out from it. This was the blood cannon attack, but similarly to his opponent, Quinn's energy beam was consistent.

The two of them clashed in the centre, and at first, it looked like Tikker's energy was winning out as Quinn's force of blood aura was pushed back.

"Hahah weak!" Tikker shouted.

Taking a step forward, though, Quinn soon increased the level of blood aura he was using, and not only that but decided to enforce the attack with Qi. His blood aura had a burst of energy, pushing back Tikker's attack.

There was no contest between the energies, and Tikker, knowing this, jumped from his position. His movement was fast and robust, and even Tikker was surprised. It seemed like it was his first time having been in this form.

However, while in the air, he soon saw Quinn was in front of him with a pair of steel wings, and his other arm pointed towards him.

"I have two arms I can use," Quinn said, shooting out another Blood cannon and hitting Tikker right in the body, sending him crashing right through three trees before he fell to the ground and tumbled.

'I thought I had used enough Aura to beat out that attack, but I had to use more and Qi. Is this what the system was talking about, where when fighting celestial energy, it was easier to use celestial energy. But it also means that it's not impossible to kill those with celestial energy just harder.

Flying over to where Tikker had landed, Quinn could get there quickly as he didn't have to care what his wings touched. The demon tier armour was able to slice through everything it touched without slowing it down,

He was then right next to Tikker before even getting up from the ground. When he eventually did stand up, Quinn could see that there was marking firm the attack on his chest. It hadn't gone through his body, and at the same time, it was healing, almost like a wound from an ordinary vampire after drinking some blood.

'I used Qi in that attack as well, and his body is still able to heal. I guess I need to try out a few things.'

Seeing his enemy in front of him, Tikker leapt, trying to grab onto Quinn, but moving to the side, Quinn then delivered a punch to its large body, one that was filled with Qi and nothing else. He felt his hand go through its thick muscles as he did something similar to his regular hammer strike.

Tikker's muscles, bones, and internals were breaking down, but while Quinn's first was still connected, he could feel they were coming together again. Still, Tikker's body was sent flying again in another direction.

'Blood energy and Qi don't work. I would have to either constantly hit him until he died before he healed or try something else. Luckily I have the ability to try something else.

"This is the last time I'm going to ask you," Quinn said as he calmly walked over to where Tikker had been sent. "Who gave you that Marking. Was it Laxmus or someone else?"

Instead of an answer, a red beam came shooting out towards him. Rather than match it in power, Quinn decided to avoid the strike by running toward him in a circle. The aura was hitting the trees and going a great distance, destroying everything. It was sure to gather the attention of others soon.

Still, Quinn could eventually see Tikker and jumped up to where he was and using his hand, he grabbed his mouth and sealed it shut, causing some of his own aura to burn his mouth somewhat apart.

Quinn continued to push him until he slammed his head onto the ground and let go. Now he could clearly see Tikker's teeth, and the skin that had been burnt off from his own attack didn't look to be healing.

'I guess using one's own energy against it works as well.'

"So you can't speak, or you won't say anything?" Quinn asked once more, beginning to lose his patience, but Tikker just stared at Quinn.

"Fine."

His hand was held out in front of Tikker, but this time he wanted to try something else, and that was gathering the celestial energy in his own body. Quinn tried to focus it on one point on his arm, and as he did, he noticed something. He could feel that the energy that was running through his body was somewhat damaging the beast tier equipment that was on his body.

Quickly, Quinn used the shadow to place it away, and now he could see even the robes that had gathered around his arm started to disintegrate. Now revealing his forearms, the red veins that would be showing on Quinn's body began to glow with power.

Seeing this, it looked like Tikker was finally worried. It was a little too late as Quinn grabbed onto Tikker's head. He noticed that he was having problems releasing this new type of energy externally. Still, he could at least power his arm and fingertips with it.

While holding onto Tikker's head, Quinn made a slight scratch mark and could tell that the wound wasn't healing.

Knowing his life was in danger, Tikker went to punch Quinn from both sides, but Quinn was far quicker. Using his celestial arm, he let go of Tikker's head and made his hand into some type of knife.

Slicing downward, both of Tikker's arms were cut off before it even touched Quinn. Now feeling Tikker's head again, Quinn could finally use his other skill.

[Celestial drain activated]

A rush of energy could be felt escaping from Tikker, and his body started to grow smaller in size. He was making no such noise, but his body just started to shake.

"Qu…Quinn…" Tikker eventulley said.

Touching his face, that's when Quinn realised that his mud mask had gone as well. Perhaps just like his armour that was being affected by the celestial energy, it was the same for the mask.

For some reason, seeing who it was, a smile appeared on the person's face.

"I got to see…."

Letting go of Tikker, Quinn thought that maybe he could have got answers. Perhaps he should have thought of this before. They worshipped him, so if he told them who he really was, then they would likely answer, but it was a little too late, as Tikker was clearly dead.

[Celestial energy drained]

[You have gained 3 points of energy]

'Why…did he look happy? What is wrong with them?' Quinn thought to himself, not knowing how to feel. Turning around, the others were still there, those that would give him some answers.

******

# Chapter 1612: Red Vampire Leader
When Quinn looked back at the fight he just had with Tikker, he wondered whether he would be able to beat such a person solely with his normal powers. The Celestial Vampire had grown leaps and bounds in all his skills, so he ultimately concluded that it should be possible.

Tikker had been classified as a 'Dedicated Follower' by his system, which from what Quinn could tell, had allowed him to benefit from a lot of energy through the Marking, yet he had been far from the same level as Laxmus.

In fact, he would put him somewhere between a Vampire leader and their Vampire knight of his time, though probably closer to the former. The raw power of the energy might have put him above them, yet in a direct fight, he would bet on the leaders whose skills should give them the advantage.

'I wonder then… how strong would a strong vampire with Celestial Energy be? Is that why Laxmus had changed into something completely different to what I saw today? Because his energy was stronger.'

Suddenly a dreaded thought crossed Quinn's mind. If Laxmus had survived until this day and age, then it was practically guaranteed that he would have far more Celestial Energy than the last time they met. At least whoever gave him the marking in the first place would have had time to gather more energy. At first, Quinn thought the Dhampirs would be his biggest threat, but now he was starting to reconsider.

At the end of the fight, he had gained 3 Celestial Points, yet he wasn't sure if that amount of points given to a follower could be considered big or small. The Celestial Vampire could only base it off his own points, which had started at 10, though only the system might be aware how many he needed to level up.

'Chances are higher that such an amount should be low. After all, why would the Celestial give so many points to a weak vampire? It would make more sense to give more points to someone strong like Laxmus… but just what type of God is Laxmus working for?'

Walking over to the vampires that were still standing where they were, it looked like Quinn's Influence skill still hadn't worn off. Looking at his arm, he could see the red glow was also starting to fade.

'Right now, I can only mix a part of the Celestial Energy with my Blood aura, but I could tell that using it in its raw form would be most effective to fight off Dedicated Followers and Celestials themselves. In other words, as long as I can only infuse the energy with my own body, I'm going to have to be fighting head on with my fist and legs a lot more.'

The question was, if he increased his Celestial Energy would he be able to use it in a pure form externally from his body? Either way, it wouldn't hurt to find more ways to increase this energy.

Covering his body with the shadow, now that the energy had faded, Quinn had decided to merely put on some of the basic armour he had on him, rather than his iconic Blue Fang set. However, he also placed the Demon tier chest piece underneath it all.

"Well, seeing as all of you should now be aware of who I am, I hope that you don't decide to do anything stupid, and will help me without having to be forced." Quinn addressed the vampires before him. Without Peter, there was no way for him to use the same disguise as he had before.

In the first place, since the Influence skill would only allow a person to get simple answers, it was always best if they admitted the truth and the Celestial Vampire could confirm it with them.

"Why should we tell you anything? You bastard just forced us to attack our leader, and then you killed him in cold blood!" The closest vampire that Quinn had set free spat at him.

Quinn naturally sidestepped the saliva, but he was confused at this reaction.

"How come you don't recognise me? I thought there were statues of me everywhere? Aren't you guys even worshipping me?" Quinn raised an eyebrow and removed his mask while also moving his long hair a bit so more of his face could show, yet none of them seem to react any more favourably.

"I'm Quinn Talen! The old Vampire King, leader of the Cursed faction." The Celestial Vampire stated, yet all he got in return was the mocking laughter of all those vampires.

"Haha, do you think we are idiots? Do you really think anyone would fall for that? If you wanted to fool us, you should have at least changed into his actual appearance!"

Quinn was left speechless. He had been worried that this might be the case, but it still felt bad that people didn't believe him when he told them who he was. Unfortunately, he couldn't really blame them.

If he was in their shoes, would he believe that a legendary figure from a thousand years ago could suddenly return?

He had even used the shadow powers, yet they didn't seem to have notice, which made Quinn wonder how Tikker had recognised him?

'Come to think of it, can I be sure he did? Maybe he was just projecting, since he was about to die?'

Looking over to the vampire's body, he noticed that it had slowly begun to disintegrate, turning into ashes. It reminded Quinn of how the Originals would die. The good thing was that it would leave no trace of his body if someone were to come looking.

"Even after defeating your group leader, you don't believe me? Alright, I guess I'll have to ask the old-fashioned way." Quinn said with his eyes glowing red once more.

He told the three to kneel down and placed the mask back on his face.

"Who gave Tikker that Marking on his body, making him a Dedicated Follower?" Quinn demanded to know.

"I don't have a name. I never saw the person who does the Marking."

Each one of them answered, and they were clearly under the Influence skill, so they couldn't be lying.

"What's the method of getting a True Marking or being selected as a Dedicated Follower?" Quinn asked.

"Only those that are selected know." They answered.

It was getting frustrating, but it was clear that the Red Vampires were very secretive about their ways. In the end, Quinn asked what he could, how large the force of Red Vampires were and similar questions.

However, it seemed like they knew little about that as well, because the Red Vampires were spread on several planets, all communicating with each other. There wasn't one group as such, and their base seemed to be constantly moving, similar to Pure's way of operating in his time.

Only once in a while they would be a summons of the Red Vampires to come together. Those who could make it would arrive, but that still wasn't the entire amount of Red Vampires. Whatever the case, the force sounded larger than that of the entire vampire settlement during his time.

The most interesting information he had managed to unearth was that they communicated with each other through telepathy. In other words, the ability of the eighth family that Quinn had only somewhat just started to bring back during his time. Each day, they would all receive a message reminding them of their goals, what they believed in and so on.

The ability truly allowed all of them to feel connected. That was then when Quinn started to ask about the two groups of vampires, once again though there wasn't a lot of information. They hadn't even properly seen the apparent 'real leader' of the Red Vampires.

When asked how they were able to trust someone they hadn't seen to this degree, the fervent answer was because of their belief in Quinn. It made him wonder who was using his name so strongly to convince vampires over to their side.

Before deciding what to do with them, a memory popped up in Quinn's head, it was about what the town's folk had said before.

"I've heard rumours about the Red Vampires getting involved in the fight against the Dhampirs. Apparently, someone strong helped in the war. Do any of you know anything about that?" Quinn asked, not really hoping for much.

"They are one of the leaders." The vampires answered.

"What's their name?"

"We do not have a name."

"What do they look like?" Quinn continued to press. "What did they have on them, what were they wearing, tell me every little thing you know, even if it was just from rumours!."

"During the battle, it was the first time we saw them in person. They had long black hair, they looked like a vampire but were slightly different as two horns stuck out from the top of their head, and they wielded a black sword with our Marking." The vampire described.

*****

# Chapter 1613: A Split Faction
Hearing the descriptions of the said person, searching through his memory bank, Quinn only knew of one person that it matched.

'It has to be Layla; could it be the person they are describing is her?' At first, Quinn was relieved to hear that she was still present after 1000 years. However, he did wonder if that was naturally possible for a Hannya, Quinn didn't know the answer, and he wished he still had Vincent in his system to ask those sorts of questions. He knew asking Ray would be a lost cause since vampires were non-existent during his time.

However, he quickly realised that it wasn't so joyous that Layla was alive. In the end, she was part of the red vampire group.

'The horns on her head, and the black sword with the marking. It has to be her, or at least maybe someone who is a relative of hers using the same sword.' Quinn thought. 'Why would she be part of the red vampires? Did someone convince her to go to the other side, or is she part of the good half of the red vampires?'

Although Quinn referred to them as the good half, the truth was that wasn't really the case at all. Speaking to Jessica, Quinn learned that not all red vampires were like Hannah. It was true that they wished to turn the humans, but some didn't care if it was by force or other means. On top of that, turning all humans into vampires wasn't part of Quinn's ambition, nor did he believe it was Layal's.

Still, it was hard to grasp how much could change in so much time.

"This leader, what part of the vampire group does she belong to? Do you know her name?" Quinn asked.

"She is a leader." The vampires replied. "The leaders are not so clearly split in views. Her name, I do not know."

The more Quinn learned, the more he needed to know what happened to the Cursed faction. What happened to them for them to be split apart so much like this. If they had gone into hiding fair enough, if they had all joined the same group, Quinn could understand but for all of them to be apart no longer working together.

Since Quinn had finished asking all the questions he needed, now it was time for him to decide what to do with the other vampires. He was considering removing their memories of this event, but then he would need to give them a reason why their leader died. A plausible one for them all.

'Still, if I just make them completely disappear from this area, and they never arrive to meet the others, that could be suspicious as well. Maybe they will send more.' Quinn was struggling with what to do, but then he realised that perhaps it wasn't a good idea for those guys to meet the other vampires.

"When entering the town, what were you planning to do there?" Quinn asked.

"We were planning to kill some of the humans and feast on their blood." The vampires replied.

Quinn already knew the answer to this one, but he had asked twice just to make sure it was the case, perhaps expecting a different answer.

"Would you ever work alongside a human?" Quinn asked again, and this was for Lucia's sake.

"No." Was the answer they had given.

It was clear that these vampires had a clear disliking for the humans, perhaps as much as the humans did back then for the Dalki. He imagined many humans would have answered the same way in that case.

"I'm sorry, I said I would protect her, and with the way you guys are, I am unable to convince you for now," Quinn said as he swung his hand towards their necks, and a single line of red aura chopped all three of their heads right off.

Quinn never liked to kill, but he currently felt no emotion towards the act. In fact, he could tell his emotions weren't really there in the same way as before since becoming a celestial. It was why his mind was always in a fog because he thought he should feel a certain way, yet he didn't.

'I'm a little worried. If I continue to evolve and grow, my feelings will completely come void. Then what, do I just become a being trying to complete his condition to grow? Is the rise in energy the only thing that I will feel? Maybe this is what happened to the others as well.'

Quinn realised that he could also burn their bodies himself using his red aura like he did before. Such strong blood energy would turn their bodies into ashes. Doing this would mean no one could no longer find them. The only thing he couldn't do anything about was the scene itself. It was clear if they were to investigate the area, they would know fighting had occurred.

——

No one had tried to talk to Quinn's shadow inside the cave itself. It had just gone up against the wall, and for the first time, it had finally moved and approached Peter. It tugged against Peter's shirt without saying anything.

"Huh, is there something wrong?" Peter asked.

The shadow clone simply nodded his head. The two of them then headed outside the cave. The other vampires seeing this were a little nervous at the actions taken, and one of them chose to follow the two, wondering what they were up to.

When he went out of the cave, he could see the two standing next to each other for some reason.

"Hey, what are you two doing?" The vampire asked.

Turning around first was Quinn.

"We just needed some fresh air, no need to worry about us. Do you have any news about the other group of vampires?"

The vampire hesitated to answer at first, wondering if there was a problem of some sort.

"No, we are going to stay here tonight. If we don't hear from them, Hannah will report back, and we will get further orders from there. I think I'm going to stay out here and stretch with you guys for a while." The vampire said, still thinking the two were up to something.

In truth, it was a close call. Quinn had gotten Peter to come out of the cave with his shadow clone because he needed a new mask to wear his disguise. Then, using the shadow link skill, he could connect with his clone, and move his whole body to the clone's location, just like he could with other shadow users.

It allowed him to travel so fast back to the area the others were. Thankfully everything had been quickly done, and Peter somewhat understood what was going on. He could tell his soul weapon was ready to use again, yet the Quinn in front of him was still disguised as Chucky. So something had to be up.

Thinking about the shadow link skill though, made Quinn worry a little. The fact that he was unable to go to any of the others with the shadow ability made him believe they were all dead, but at the same time, it wasn't like he could travel to Laxmus, who had the shadow powers as well. Or at least Quinn thought he would. So perhaps there was something else going on with his shadow link.

In the end, after doing nothing for a while, the vampire was ready to go inside, and it was at a good time as well since Hannah had called him in. This gave Quinn a chance to do something that he had wished to do before.

"So, are you going to tell me what happened then?" Peter asked.

After telling Peter all the details, Peter seemed quite surprised.

"Quinn, you have gotten a bit more..ballsy since you slept. I couldn't imagine you going out to attack them first..and do you really think it's Layla? I mean, I guess it would explain the obsession the red vampires have with you since you know she was obsessed with you."

"I just feel like, in the past, a lot of my mistakes came from hesitating or not acting, and I don't want the same to happen again, which is why I have a request. I'm going to make you a dedicated follower." Quinn said with a smile.

[Please think of the marking you would like to place on your dedicated follower]

[This marking will be placed on all dedicated followers and can not be changed]

"Peter, I'm going to make sure you get so strong that I never lose you as well."

******

# Chapter 1614: The Celestial Mark
Of course, Quinn had somewhat explained to Peter what he was planning to do to him. He wasn't going to leave the latter blind about the situation, but of course, a lot of it went over Peter's head. Even when he wasn't a Wight, the latter wasn't exactly the smartest person in the room.

However, even though Peter didn't quite understand what was going on, he already had his answer.

"Of course, Quinn, you know that I don't understand much, but honestly, I still haven't forgiven myself for what I did to you; I almost killed you, and even after that, you saved me. In my eyes, my life is yours." Peter answered.

One thing was clear: if Quinn were to die, then all those deemed as dedicated followers would die as well. Hearing Peter's words made Quinn a little at ease, but he was still worried.

The first step of marking was to decide what exactly his marking would be. He had no clue and was up for choosing almost anything, but when thinking about specific objects, a system screen appeared in front of him.

It was a mesh of grid-like material in front of his eyes, and as Quinn thought about something, a falt surface 2D logo that only he could see would appear in front of him.

Of course, when thinking of vampires, a bat-shaped logo had come to Quinn's mind. Ever since he had become one and during the time of his research, he noticed that many fantasy books seemed to link bats with vampires.

At the same time, the shape on the screen in front of him changed to that of a bat. However, looking at this made him immediately think of the other markings that he had seen on the weapons, among other things. The last thing he wanted to do was confuse his followers with others.

In the end, no matter how hard Quinn tried, he couldn't think of anything unique.

'I have a suggestion for you.' A voice that had been silent for a long time in his head had finally popped up. It was his ancestor Ray, the great dragon of his time. 'With my powers, I was also able to place a marking on others. At the time, we had created a group, naming it the Red Wings. The emblem was of a red-blooded dragon head.'

As soon as Ray said those words, an image appeared in Quinn's head.

'How…did you get it exactly right the first time?' There was a slight surprise in Ray's voice this time. The two did share some blood though, but it still felt strange.

'Is this what it looked like? I mean, when you spoke, it just kind of came into my head. Why don't we make a few changes in it and modify it a bit?'

When thinking it through, Quinn had come up with one idea. Behind the dragon head itself, Quinn had created a black shield, and then he added chains in a cross lined fashion around the shield. This was his little remembrance towards Arthur.

When using his shadow powers at his strongest, Arthur had condescended it down into a shield. At the same time, he was part of the Punishers, the ones who had the duty to keep order among the vampires.

Quinn knew he could no longer hold his previous standings with what he was currently becoming. Position such as Cursed leader or the vampire king - No, being a celestial meant he was above that.

Maybe, Arthur was a Judge the vampires needed, and perhaps Quinn could become that judge the world needed, by becoming the Punisher for not just the vampires but everyone in the world.

'What the hell am I thinking?' Quinn thought to himself as he shook his head and hit the confirm button on the screen. The next second, Peter suddenly felt a burning sensation on his body.

They heard a sizzling sound as if the mark was being branded on his skin using a hot iron. Burning a part of his shirt away, the marking could now be seen right there in the centre of his chest.

"Wow, it looks exactly like it did on the system," Quinn said, amazed as he almost grazed his finger across it, slowly feeling the indented bits on his skin. GEtting closer Quinn's face was quite close to his chest.

"I'm…sorry," Jessica said, her face red, as she was standing by the cave exit and quickly turned away to head back inside.

That's when Quinn noticed that the scene might have seemed quite odd from the outside since Peter had ripped his shirt open, and Quinn had not only placed his finger against his chest but was closely staring at the former's chest. Quickly taking his hand back, Quinn cleared his throat.

Checking out the system, he could now see a dedicated tab for his dedicated followers, and there was another pleasant surprise.

[1 dedicated follower has been gained]

[For each dedicated follower, you will gain 1 Celestial energy point. As long as the dedicated follower is alive, the Celestial point will remain.]

Now Quinn's total has gone up to 14. Gaining followers was easier than gaining dedicated followers, and due to the considerable risk, Quinn thought there was finally something worth the reward amount.

'Wait, this means that whoever gave the celestial points to Tikker definitely knows that he's no longer alive. I wonder what they will do then?'

At the same time, it was time for Quinn to decide something else. He could hand over and take points from dedicated followers as he wished with the help of the system. Since he was still plenty strong, with 14 points, Quinn gave four over to Peter.

The marking on his chest glowed when he did this.

"Do you feel stronger at all, or maybe like you can turn into a monster or something?" Quinn asked.

"I can feel an energy inside me, maybe my body is a little stronger, but I don't really know how to use it," Peter replied.

Just then, Jessica came out again and cleared her throat.

"If you two are done or not too busy, then we should head inside. There has been an update."

For now, just Peter having the celestial energy would have to be enough. Perhaps through combat, he would figure out how to use it.

Heading inside the cave, they saw that all the other vampires had a pulled expression and were standing with their arms crossed, no longer relaxed like before. The room was a little tense making Quinn wonder if they had found out about what he had done.

Either way, it wasn't like they could do anything about it themselves.

"I finally have news," Hannah replied. "It looks like Tikker, and the other red vampires won't be joining us after all. The higher-ups have instructed us to go ahead and start the mission on our own."

The others had already heard this, and Quinn realised he needed to make a surprised expression, even though he knew something like this was bound to happen.

But there was one thing that he did find interesting: they hadn't informed Hannah or the group of what exactly happened with Tikker, and instead of telling them to wait for reinforcements, they had told this group to continue with the task.

...

When Hannah tapped the ring on her finger, a red portal opened up in front of her. It was the new type of storage room created with more powerful crystals.

"Everyone place your masks or any item that will indicate that you are part of the Red vampires in here," Hannah ordered.

One by one, they all followed Hannah's order. Even Quinn placed the mask he had before inside the storage room.

"Now, remember we are going to join the Vampire Corps. This task is not small, and there is no time frame. Our mission is to try and gather as much information about the Red heart as possible. If not, at least try to obtain a high rank in the Vampire Corps. This way, we can be helpful to the cause. There are other members of the Red vampires who are already part of the Vampire Corps.

"If you recognise or encounter them, you are to do nothing and pretend you know nothing about them. They are strangers to you, just like any other member of the Vampire Corps. Any matters to do with the Red Vampires, we shall communicate through the base."

She looked over to Quinn and his group.

"Sorry, although we are bringing you along, you will only be a partial member since you won't be able to contact the base. Once this mission is over, though, I promise we will welcome you into the Red vampires."

Nodding his head, Quinn gave a slight smile in response.

It was time for them to head to the Vampire Corps Unit, where most of the string ability users were present, giving Quinn a good idea of just who he might meet or learn about in the base.

'One of my first, and most loyal friends…My blood brother.'

# Chapter 1615: Keep Up
With them being vampires, they could travel through the night, and the speed they were travelling at was nothing to be scoffed at either. Quinn could tell that these vampires were just like regular vampires, yet their strength was higher than the vampires from Quinn's time.

He didn't know if it was just because they were Red vampires or if vampires had naturally grown stronger in these thousand years. Still, it was nothing compared to the millennia ago vampires. As they ran across a vast land to get to the location of the Vampire Corps base, Quinn and his group were keeping up with all of them quite easily.

Quinn was carrying Minny on his shoulders, who looked peacefully sleeping on top of his head. It was quite an achievement, considering the wind hitting them, and the 'ride' was also not something one would describe as smooth. It seemed like, similar to young humans, the young vampires needed more sleep as well.

At the same time, someone else was getting a ride as they continued to run. It was Lucia, and she was getting a piggyback ride from none other than Peter. Currently, her eyes were closed as if she was dozing off.

At first, Lucia was pretty reluctant to take a ride with the others. In fact, she even ran alongside everyone for some time. She was able to use a skill called the lightning step, which gave her great speed by amplifying the Qi in her steps, and in the end, she was not slower than the vampires.

However, it used a great amount of MC cells, and soon she could no longer keep up. Of course, the vampires refused to wait for her since they did not even want her to accompany them in the first place, and before Quinn could even suggest something, Peter had already volunteered.

One of the Red Vampires, running by Hannah's side, glanced behind. He was the vice-captain of the group and went by the name of Derik.

"Hannah, the sun is starting to rise. Maybe we should pick up the pace. We wasted too much time waiting for the other group." Derik suggested.

She glanced at the others and noticed that no one looked tired, and she had been holding back due to Quinn and Peter carrying people. Still, Derik was right, and soon she picked up the pace.

After a good fifteen minutes had passed, Derik turned around expecting to see the others tired or lagging, but they were keeping up just fine. In fact, Quinn was now even holding Jessica like a princess as he continued to run.

"Sorry about this… I'm not the best when it comes to running." Jessica explained with a shy red face.

"It's okay," Quinn replied with a straight face, "This isn't a problem for me, honestly."

Seeing this sight just caused Derik to push himself further. He started to run a little ahead of Hannah this time. She didn't say anything herself though and decided just to keep up.

Once again, a short while later, and this time, Derik didn't look back, as he was far too focused on running forward. He was practically going as fast as he could while pacing himself for the long distance.

'They must be tired by now and far behind me or something.' Derik thought,

Just then, he heard an odd sound, and when looking up, he felt like his eyes were going to jump out of his sockets. Derik even went to pinch himself as he thought he was sleeping.

Not too far ahead was Quinn, running backwards while carrying Jessica and Minny, and it didn't look like he lost any sweat in all this while Derik had focused all his strength on running faster.

"What are you doing? Do you not care about the others?" Quinn asked.

"You're exhausting your people too much," Quinn said. "If we run into beasts, the enemy or anything else, they will be too tired to fight."

Turning his head, Derik realised that Quinn was right. Keeping up with his speed was simply too much for them, so he immediately decided to slow his pace in the end.

'I may have lost this one, but speed isn't everything.' Derik thought while looking at Quinn, who was unaware that the former was trying to compete with him. After a few more minutes, the group could see something resembling a city.

There were no borders since the area they had been travelling in was considered one big border, with the beast areas being the lesser parts of the planets. Still, as they entered, they began to slow down their stride and were soon walking through streets.

For the first time after waking, Quinn and Peter could tell that there were more vampires than Humans around them. The humans were only a few, here and there, and they looked content while minding their own business.

However, what Quinn liked more were the vampires' smiling, relaxed, and cheerful expressions.

"This is where the families of those in the Vampire Corps live. They get a free place to live, an allowance and a few more special benefits for being a part of the corps." Jessica explained.

Originally, she was meant to be the one that would introduce the group into the corps, but since joining the Red Vampires, it seemed like it would be best if the others didn't know of their past. However, this did mean that the group would have to join the corps through conventional means.

"So, are there any human and vampire relationships too?" Quinn asked, looking at a human and a vampire walking side by side.

"Yes," Jessica answered. "Although it's still not too common. It takes a lot for a vampire and human to be together, and there is also the problem with conceiving."

"You sure do ask a lot of questions," Hannah said, having overheard everything the others were saying. "However, the girl is right; it's actually one of the ways that most humans are turned into vampires. Since Humans and Vampires can't conceive a child, but two vampires can, the best thing to do is to be turned.

"Still, the turner and turned can't be together, so they would usually go to the vampire corps to get it more officialised by someone else."

...

Eventually, the group reached the end of the city, and now they had walked into a bit of a wasteland. There were roads and paths leading towards what looked like a large set of barracks in the distance. There were several large buildings, vehicles, and even the racket of vampires undergoing some sort of physical training.

"I feel like I should warn you about something because it seems you still aren't fully aware of what you have gotten yourself into." Hannah started to explain. "All of the Vampire Corps bases are placed on the border of their respective territories. What this means is that they are the first place to be attacked and the first line of defence, so you all need to be aware of this."

"Attacked by the Dhampirs? Or something else?" Quinn mumbled, stepping back a bit so Hannah couldn't eavesdrop like she had been doing.

"You're correct in some way," Jessica whispered. "Technically, there are only three territories: The Vampire Corps, Pure and Green. However, the Vampire Crops and the Logan Green's region have amicable relations with each other. Also, Pure's territories are officially recognised too, and while everyone knows that they are working with the Dhampirs, it's not official."

——

At that moment, a large ship was seen landing in the Vampire Corps area. The vampires on the ground were quickly reorganising themselves as if they were expecting quite the important guests. And when the ship landed, they all straightened themselves and saluted.

A young blonde man and a slightly older middle-aged blonde woman stepped out when the ship's door opened.

"Do you remember the plan, right mum?" the young man said. "We are just staying here for a little bit while we look for the people on dad's list."

"You told me a hundred times, do you think I have a memory of a goldfish? I know it's dire considering he wanted me to accompany you. I wonder who these people are?"

Just then, as they reached the last step, one of the vampires stood in front of the two and greeted them with a bow.

"It's an honour to meet you, Master Green, and Mrs Blade."

*****

# Chapter 1616: Bring The Whole Army!
After moving for a small distance away from the city they had just passed through, the group entered the vampire barracks. This was the core of the Vampire Corps Base. There were countless guards, standing straight and vigilant, guarding the whole base. This wasn't a place one could just walk into with no problems.

However, Quinn and his group didn't seem to be the only vampires that were outsiders to the place. Upon walking around the large barracks area, they found a recruitment centre that was off to the side.

"Those vampires are trying to join the Corps?" Quinn asked.

"Yes, a lot of the Thirteen Family vampires have been joining the corps recently," Jessica replied.

"Won't that put them on the frontlines of action?" Quinn replied.

"Yes, but these days it's better than staying on the Graylash planet." Lucia, who was also walking with the group, attracted the most attention. Although there were humans in the area, not many were nearby the Vampire Corps, mainly because it was rare for humans to show interest in recruitment.

"You saw the discrimination they have been getting. Just to not feel like outsiders, they have decided to join this place. That way, no one can blame them for the attacks anymore."

Originally the plan was to use Jessica's connections to enter the base. She could help them meet someone higher up, which would then get them close to the information or a chance to contact Logan green, and most importantly, they could even find a way to reach earth.

However, now that they were with the red vampires, it was time for them to just go along with the flow to see exactly what they had planned.

Before joining the long line of prospective recruits, Hannah stopped the group of vampires to give them one last briefing.

"Now, remember, the recruitment process means they are looking for talented people. Our job is to rise in this organisation, so you shouldn't hold back. Show them your full strength and go up the ranks." When saying these words, Hannah looked towards Quinn.

"Yes..full power!" Minny said, punching her fist towards the air.

Upon entering the recruitment area, each person was given a digital form to fill in. It asked about their current ability and what type of position they were applying for, Whether it be a support, worker, frontlines, etc. On top of that, the form even presented regular job titles, such as cook and more.

It made Quinn quite happy to see this. During his time, they only cared about one thing: how strong one was. Of course, based on what Hannah was saying, most of them seemed like they were trying to become fighters.

"What should I put?" Minny asked.

"Don't worry, just put no ability for now, and I doubt we will be at this recruitment stage for long anyway." Quinn smiled back.

After filling everything in, their group of about fifty recruits was called in. They were now on an open wasteland that looked quite destroyed, and this reminded Quinn of when he had taken the school's first assessment.

Initially, there were more Humans in the group, but the groups got split off based on what role they had selected and wished to be a part of. In the end, Lucia was the only person who chose the frontlines and was also a human.

Standing in front of them were five vampires, all of them at the vampire noble rank, and they were wearing a new design of uniform that Quinn was seeing for the first time. It was a light black looking leather armour that offered a good amount of protection while not restricting their movements.

On top of that, Quinn could tell that it was beast gear made at the emperor level.

'It looks like the vampires have given in to the thought that beast gear makes them look weak, but they still are struggling against the Dhampirs. This enemy must be quite strong.'

"My name is Mitchell Sanguinis, and I am happy to see that there are so many new recruits, especially in tough times like these!" The leader of the recruitment centre spoke. He had a black eyepatch covering one of his eyes, which Quinn found weird since if it was a wound, it should have been something that one could have quickly healed.

"Every day, the Dhampirs are moving more and more forward. Pure continues to support them behind the scenes, and the actions of the red vampires are driving public opinion against us. This is why we need to stay true to our goals.

"We will not be the aggressors! But we will train damn well hard enough to protect those that we care about, whether they are human or vampires. That is why the Vampire Corps exists! We are not a group out there to eliminate the Dhampir or stop the red vampires from doing what they are doing. We are just protectors to protect those we care about. If you joined to eliminate Pure or fight back the Dhampirs because they killed your loved ones or for revenge, then leave now! Because we don't want those types of people in the vampire corps!"

Hearing these words put a big smile on Quinn's face. The Vampire Corps's objectives seemed to be the closest to what his thoughts were, and he truly understood them. On top of that, the family name was that of the thirteenth family. It was as Quinn expected, the Vampire Corps must have been quite closely related to Fex.

"You seem to have a large smile on your face, young man. Is there a reason for that?" Mitchell asked.

"I just like what I am hearing; it seems like this is the perfect place for me," Quinn replied.

Some of the people left after what Mitchell had said. It looked like a couple of vampires had the wrong agenda. They had thrown on their faces and spat on the floor before leaving. The corps Unit did nothing, allowing them to go.

"I like the look on your face; I look forward to seeing your performance in the assessment." Mitchell smiled back.

The assessment was quite simple. The vampires were to fight against the current members of the Vampire Corps - the five infront of them. If they can defeat one of the members successfully, they would face two opponents at once in the next round, and the number would keep increasing until they reached the maximum of five, with Mitchell stepping in the last round.

While watching the other participants, Quinn noticed that the other vampires didn't have beast gear or beast weapons, putting them at quite a disadvantage; on top of that, many of the recruits didn't seem like fighters to Quinn.

There weren't many that could beat even one of the Vampire Corps members. However, Mitchell said that they would be trained.

"These vampires, I feel a little sad for them," Jessica commented. "They had earlier decided to stay away from the fighting, perhaps just wanted to live happy, normal lives, but now have decided to come here."

Eventually, the red blood vampires in the group were being assessed, and they were making quite the impression on the recruiters. Most of them could take out two of the Corps Members at once but failed to deal with a trio, all apart from Derik, who managed to beat three Corps members at once.

"Stop!" Mitchell called before the fighting got out of hand.

"What?! I can take on four of them!" Derik shouted back.

"Look at yourself; you should know your limit," Mitchell stated. "You are clearly a strong vampire. Remember, we are not saying you couldn't take on four at once, but this test also tests your endurance, as we add more opponents, and the level of their strength varies as well."

Not everyone had been assessed yet, including Peter and Hannah, and then, the man called out a name.

"Nate Snell!"

That was when Quinn. He stepped forward and entered the field.

"Don't disappoint me," Mitchell commented as the first vampire corps member stepped forward.

Thinking about the situation, Quinn didn't want to waste time. He wasn't planning to gradually rise in the ranks or anything like that. Rather, he was going to make a big bang so that he could meet the person at the top straight away.

"You might need your whole army if you want to take me down," Quinn said, holding out his hand like a gun.

-bang!

Everyone heard a quick blow, and instantly, both of the Vampire Corps members in front of him fell on their knees.

Mitchell's eyes lit up seeing this, and the grin on his face went wide, almost up to his ears.

"You really didn't disappoint me!" Mitchell said as he prepared to step forward and shouted. "All five, attack!"

Ignoring the recruitment rules, he directly went for the main course by increasing the number of opponents to five, including himself.

"Five? Didn't you hear me? You will need a whole army to make me serious." Quinn repeated his words, this time his eyes glowing red.

*****

# Chapter 1617: What You Can Do, I Can Do Better
In all honesty, the Red Vampires themselves were looking forward to seeing the true strength of their newest members, particularly of the one who introduced himself as Nate. They have seen him use the Blood Bullet, a strong, powerful skill only known by a few select vampires.

However, rather than strong, what they thought Quinn had done at the time was something clever. Although it was a powerful skill, it's common knowledge that one can't use it multiple times consecutively. Perhaps, he was betting that his opponents were unaware of the drawback of such a strong skill.

But here, he was going up against vampires. It would be hard to come across a vampire who didn't know about Blood Bullet, especially in this place.

'Let's see how strong you really are,' Derik narrowed his eyes. Hannah, standing by his side, was making sure not to blink for any moment in case she missed a good show.

The four examiner Corps members quickly got into a formation. Getting into what looked like an arrowhead, they spread out a little wide apart. One position of the formation didn't quite look right, and that was because the one that Quinn had attacked too long ago was yet to get up from the ground.

"What are you doing? Use your blood canister and get up!" One of the members shouted while carefully keeping an eye on Quinn from the corner of his eye, vigilant against any sudden move from the latter. However, the five were surprised because, for some reason, their opponent looked calm while facing them and just stood there with his one hand by his side and his hand pointing his finger towards them, still in a gun-like shape.

"I already took my canister, I can't heal… it's like… it's like he used Qi or something; you have to be careful, he's dangerous!" the injured member shouted back.

Each member carried a canister of blood along with them. It helped them to heal an injury, to use more blood attacks in an emergency or to boost their strength during a battle. But a vampire who could use Qi with strong blood skills like the Blood Bullet was extremely dangerous, and a canister would most likely be useless in this situation. This was why Mitchell had decided to step up into action as soon as possible.

"Strike!" Mithchell commanded, "Blood Barrage!"

The four vampires swung their arms as fast as they could and, realising from the ends of their fingertips, were countless blood strikes all aimed towards Quinn, and at the same time, their formation was on the move too, as their attacks headed straight for Quinn.

They moved in such a way that the direction of their attacks was varying, not just coming from one place.

"This is bad. Won't we get hurt in the process?!" One of the participants shouted.

Just then, the other corps members who had been watching the assessment so far and weren't part of the ones assessing had come in and stood in front of the other participants, ready to block whatever impact that was coming their way.

'I can feel each one of their attacks, the blood swipes are moving so slowly…and if I really wanted to, I could control the red energy and make it so that it would work against them. Although I can't use Blood Control or Shadow, however, there's a lot more I can still use.' Quinn thought.

Enveloping both his arms in his own Blood Aura, Quinn swung one arm, fast and strong, and released a single streak of attack. It didn't look big, but the energy itself was condensed and purer than what was being used against him.

The second Quinn's Blood Aura touched a row of the Barrage of blood swipes, it smashed right through the swipes and continued breaking through them all until it hit the vampire, cutting through the armour and leaving a deep cut on his skin.

For the others, Quinn attacked them as well, swinging his other arms and using both his legs to deliver the Blood Crescent kicks. Each time, Quinn's blood attacks showed no signs of slowing down, irrespective of how many strikes the Blood Aura clashed against it.

In fact, although Quinn claimed that he wouldn't use his Blood Aura in the assessment, the truth was he was forced to use it at the last moment to diminish his own attack from killing the corps members. This clearly went unnoticed by the others because they could not tell the sheer power and precision in those single strikes, but it was enough to impress them.

But it was not the end because Mitchell suddenly held out his own hand out, with his index finger pointed out.

"You're not the only one that knows a few advanced blood skills," He said.

It looked like what he was about to perform was a Blood Bullet. It was the Red Vampires' guess as well. Instead, a quick sharp blast of red aura started to gather around the finger. A red ball continued to condense and expand in size.

"You know, enemies have given me a funny nickname. They call me the Blood Sniper." Mitchell said before lifting his hand, and a loud, shocking bang echoed through the entire site. The sound was like a sniper rifle going off, and the power behind it was also more substantial.

At the same time, Mitchell's entire arm recoiled so hard that no matter the strength in his hand was, the sound of his shoulder joints cracking echoed in the background of the explosion. In the next instant, his finger and arm were completely destroyed because of the aftereffects.

'Lieutenant Mitchell really decided to go that far?' One of the corps members whispered as the former covered his wound with his other hand. 'He won't be able to recover for the entire day using that skill, and he could kill the contestant. If that happens, then all sorts of rumours will spread!'

Seeing the attack, Quinn was quite impressed but remained unfazed.

'I'm happy to know that vampires are evolving. It looks like he's using a blood skill that even I don't know about, but the system has shown me something interesting.'

[Specialised Blood Bullet attack has been analysed]

[User has obtained a new skill]

[You may now use the skill: Rifle Blood Shot]

It reminded Quinn of when he had developed his own Blood crescent kick, a move that wasn't taught by other vampires but allowed him to use his own skills. It looked like the other vampires could do the same, developing their own set of skills. But now that Quinn was the Ruler Of Blood, there wasn't anything he couldn't do.

He raised his hand, blood gathered around his finger. Even though Quinn had made this move after Mitchell had already produced the attack, Quinn could do everything faster - from the condensing of the blood and, finally, the attack itself.

*BANG*

A loud shot went off again when the incoming Blood Bullet was inches away from Quinn's own finger. It was safe to say the second his Blood Bullet collided with Mitchell's, the latter's shot turned into nothing.

'He copied my specialised attack? An attack that took me years to make my own, years to develop and one that allowed me to rise to the position I am at today? This person, he's not just special...he's a monster.'

The smile never disappeared from his face. While others would be jealous, Mitchell was just proud to know a strong vampire like Quinn would be part of the Vampire Corps. He was bracing himself for the pain. The attack was aimed towards Quinn's shoulder to give the slightest injury if the latter failed to defend. Since Quinn's bullet had hit his bulled dead-on, then he too would be shot in the shoulder.

Yet, it never hit him, and the Blood Bullet was so fast that the others could not see anything else.

"You will be okay," Quinn stated.

Mitchell was now confused. How did the Blood Bullet not his body? No one can divert one of the fastest blood attacks mid-air. Even with great blood control, one can't change the trajectory of the attack, which was going at lightning speed, not to mention the short distance between the target.

"STOP!" Mitchell shouted. "The assessment for this person is over. I guess you were serious when you said you could take on our whole army; just who are you?"

When Quinn was thinking about an answer, and others were inclined to hear what he had to say, everyone heard someone clapping.

"That was quite the good performance that you put on. No wonder my father is interested in you, but I don't really care about that. These guys clearly aren't enough to make you go all out. How about you let me have a go." Everyone turned their attention towards a young man.

Perhaps Quinn was far too distracted about the system or focused on suppressing his blood skills to notice that this young man had come through the group of Vampire Corps and was standing in front of them. But another thing that surprised him was that this person clearly smelled like a human.

'Who is this person? He can't just be anyone, for the vampire crops to allow them in a place like this.' Quinn thought.

But in the next moment, before he could get his answers, he noticed a blonde-haired woman standing by the young man's side. It took a second for Quinn to realise, but it clicked in his mind. The woman looked slightly older than how he had met her last time, but not on par with the amount of time that has passed since then.

'Isn't that...Vicky Blade? From the Blade family?!... She's Vorden's sister! But what is she doing here, and how is she still alive? Also...if she's still alive...does it mean Sil, Vordnen, and the others could be alive as well!'

*****

# Chapter 1618: A Worthy Person
Although Quinn hadn't seen Vicky much, he had burned the image of her face in his head because it was one of the few times he had come closest to no longer being in this world. She was one of the members of the Blade family, the family known as the strongest in the world, and with her twin brother, she was able to use abilities at the same level as Sil.

If it wasn't for Sil, Vorden and Raten helping him out at that time, it was quite possible that Quinn would no longer be alive today.

'How could Vicky still be alive after a thousand years? It makes no sense.' Quinn thought, his eyes glued to her, ignoring all the vampires and also the young man who was standing next to her.

Quinn was so fixated on this fact because Vicky could possibly be the first person he met who was still alive during his time. Sure he had heard about Owen from Zinon and knew that Logan Green might also be alive, but this was different from earlier because he saw the other party in the flesh.

'I have to ask her; I have to get answers about what happened. I know she wasn't close with the Cursed faction, but the Blade Family helped us out during the war, and Vorden and the others had made up with them…it should be okay; they're on our side, right?' Although Quinn was trying to convince himself, he was still worried.

He was worried that the Blade family could now be working with the Green faction. In the past, it was so easy to know who was good or bad, but now, Quinn knew nothing of the current state of the world. Should he trust Zinon's words…the past.... and now, there was a good chance that perhaps even Layla was part of the Red Vampires.

In the end, thinking all of this, Quinn spoke out.

"Vicky…Vicky Blade.." He looked up, staring right at her.

"Looks like you know my name, congratulations," Vicky said, still with her arms folded, seemingly not caring about anything.

Of course, it was no big deal to the others and everyone around them. Vicky Blade was quite a well-known figure due to her position with the Green family and on the Earth. However, for Quinn, it was the confirmation he needed and to know that he wasn't going crazy.

However, some were quite surprised by this, especially the two young ladies.

'Wait, Nate..is an Original, and he said he was in slumber for a thousand years, right? So how does he know Vicky Blade? That makes no sense. Was she alive back then?' Jessica thought.

She tried to remember, but she couldn't recall any mention of the former's name whatsoever. Vicky blade wasn't a well-known person back then. Yet, it was clear that the special vampire with her knew about the former's identity.

"Hey, what the hell is wrong with you!" the young blonde man shouted. He walked ahead of the others and ordered the vampires to stand back. Mitchell looked at him for a few seconds as if he wanted to say something, but he didn't and instructed the other corps members back as well, while Vicky stood off to the side, not doing anything.

"I mean, you recognise her, but you don't recognise me at all? How is that even possible? Me, Jake Green!" Jake pulled out a small mirror, looking at himself, to see if there was anything wrong with his face, but everything seemed to be normal.

Upon hearing these words, there wasn't much reaction apart from a smile from Quinn, and eventually, he mumbled a few words.

"I'm happy…it looks like you must have made a family of some sort."

Realising that the Green in front of him could be related to Logan Green made Quinn think of something else. What if the current Logan Green wasn't the same one as before. It had been so long, maybe Logan had made a family, and his descendants wished to use his name. Either way, thinking of his friend who looked like a middle schooler and showed a lack of emotions, especially when it came to settling down and creating a family, Quinn couldn't help but smile.

'Even if your family have gone on the wrong side...Or have done wrong, I don't think I could ever hurt them knowing that they are your blood.' Quinn thought. 'I wonder though…who did you end up with?'

"Hey, so who is this Jake Green even meant to be, that he's acting so confident."

"Hey, who the hell is this Jake Green? Why is he acting so confident?" Peter asked, folding his arms, wondering if Quinn might need him as a backup at any moment.

Before replying, Jessica looked around for a few seconds to see if there was anyone nearby or if the Red blood vampires were paying attention to them, but even their faces had a look of concern while staring at the young man.

"That person... is probably just as famous as Logan Green. He is currently known as the strongest human in existence." Jessica whispered.

For a brief second, hearing this sentence made Peter shiver internally. It was a strange reaction because his body was numb primarily. However, this time it was as if his body acted on its own. The last time he had heard something like this, it was about Hilston Blade. A frightening force of power that they never really managed to see to the full extent.

Seeing Vicky, Quinn had almost ignored all those around him. He was getting tunnel vision, it felt like everyone around drowned out, and now only he and Vicky were in the same room.

"Vicky...are they still alive? Your family…your brothers and the rest of them...how are they doing?" When Quinn asked this question, his voice was gentle, and Vicky froze in that very instant.

Her crossed arms moved and fell to her side as if losing all their strength.

"Who…who are you?" She looked at Quinn in surprise.

"He's someone who father is interested in!" Jake shouted as he stomped the floor, and immediately after, a large solid black substance came out from the ground. It seemed this was done using the Earth Ability, yet it was also coated with the hardening ability.

However, feeling this, Quinn didn't do much apart from ready his fist and lightly punched the ground directly beneath him. Quinn himself was pretty surprised with how vital the substance was. This time, he even had to add a bit of his Qi simultaneously, bending the 'object' created by the young man, sending it back into the ground and creating a small crater underneath because of the impact.

'What was that…it felt like a type of metal.' Quinn thought.

"Nice, nice, I find you quite interesting by the second, but things will soon get harder from here out!" Jake shouted, his eyes now glowing a slight green with a tinge of yellow pupils in them.

He spread out his hands, and water appeared around them, spiralling outwards from the tip of his fingers, and slowly, two water swords appeared in his hands.

"You know, in the past, the Graylash family claimed that their lightning powers were the strongest ability that the world had ever seen. You know, many of them would have to agree, even after including the Blade family, there was no single ability stronger than lightning, but lately, after encountering me, the Graylash family are quite afraid to make that remark anymore."

Just then, sparks began to form around Jake's hand and spiralled around the water swords in his hands he had just created. Like a dragon around a mountain, the lightning enveloped the swords and infused itself with the weapon, becoming lightning water swords.

'Is this…is he mixing two abilities at once…now I understand what he did with the earth ability', Quinn thought. 'He mixed the Hardening ability with that of the Earth ability, and now, he did the same with Lightning and Water..this is something no one from the Blade family could do in the past...how is this even possible?'

At first, Quinn was a bit taken aback upon learning of this fact, but at the same time, he was feeling quite excited.

He didn't consider himself one that enjoyed fighting, but lately, ever since he woke up from the thousand-year-long slumber, he hadn't come across any person who could make him serious in a battle, much less push him back.

Maybe, the young man in front of him could create some type of challenge worth the excitement.

# Chapter 1619: Old Gen Vs New Gen
The Blade family was known as the strongest family in existence. Honestly, through all the experiences Quinn had, he would certainly agree. However, Sil, one of the strongest Blades, was on his side.

This was because Sil was able to control six different abilities, and quite frankly, depending on what abilities Sil held at the time, there stood a chance that even Quinn wouldn't be a match for him. On top of that, Sill had even unlocked his soul weapon.

That was something that none of the Blades could do in the past. The soul weapon allowed Sil to use abilities he encountered, even if he faced it just once. He could then select them as he wished. It allowed him to be versatile, changing abilities depending on who they met, and it also got rid of their one weakness: one needed other ability users around them to fight.

Still, one person always seemed more frightening than Sil, and that was Hilston Blade himself. Even though he carried fewer abilities, he knew how to use them better, and his fighting skills were also unmatched. Not to mention, his body had more Qi than the average person despite never training in it; this was something which Sil lacked.

Regardless of all this, what Quinn was witnessing right now with Jake in front of him, was something entirely different from all the other Blades he had fought before.

Jake was able to not only hold multiple abilities, but it looked like he was able to combine their powers as well.

Sil was somewhat able to do this to a degree, where he could use super speed to rush himself forward and quickly change his ability to super strength and hardening and then deliver a decisive deadly blow. Rather than directly combining the powers together though, Sil used the momentum and effect of the last ability to create a more potent punch.

'What I'm witnessing right now, though, is a completely different thing. He is definitely combining the water with lightning powers, but why can he use multiple abilities? I thought his family name was Green. Wait...Vicky is standing next to him; she's a Blade...don't tell me…' Quinn thought.

A slight smirk appeared on Jake's face, and Quinn could sense something was about to ensue. Stepping off from the ground, he disappeared from the spot, and as soon as he did, the dust on the ground below his feet began to swirl around.

No one had kept track of Jake's movements; apart from Quinn, that was. Quinn saw the water-lightning blade extending right towards his face, and Jake wasn't pulling back any of his strength.

Lifting up his hand, Quinn had no choice, but to use his blood hardening on his hand and attempt to grab the blade.

'He's fast…just as fast as me without the blue fang set.' Quinn thought. 'Which means he's now using three abilities at once...How many abilities can he use at the same time? How many abilities can he hold? And his swing...He's not an amateur with the blade.'

Seeing this, Quinn had no choice but to expel an even more red aura towards his hand, covering his gauntlet even more. As he grabbed the water part of the blade with his hand, he tightened his grip around it. The water was constantly moving up and down like a saw. Without Jake having to move the blade, the flowing water of the blade was continuously cutting through Quinn's red aura.

Quinn could feel the water blade break through his Qi and blood aura, but as quickly as it was cutting through, the more blood aura Quinn would add into his blood hardening. He wasn't losing out. However, the lightning from the blade started to strike around Quinn's entire body just then.

In the next moment, lightning from the blade wrapped Quinn's whole body.

"He's done for!" Derik shouted. "Why is Jake Green going so hard against him? Shouldn't this just be an assessment?"

Honestly, Hannah was concerned. After finding such a great vampire, one who was unknown to the world, she thought she had hit the jackpot for her superiors, but now it looked like he would amount to nothing.

"Is Daddy going to be okay?" Minny shouted out, tugging on Peter, expecting him to do something to help.

The two girls were also concerned. To them, even though Quinn was an original vampire and had great healing capabilities, this exchange was on a different level. The title of Strongest human wasn't just given to just anybody. Jake was one of the main reasons why the Pure and the Dhampirs hadn't started a full-force attack and tried to take over the Green territory. This person alone was deterring one of the most prominent factions in the world.

"You should know by now, Minny," Peter replied. "If I thought he was in trouble, I would have moved already."

There was a reason why Peter wasn't worried, and it was due to the mud mask that Quinn was wearing. If the lightning was hitting Quinn's real body, one of that level, and hurting him, then the mud mask would have fallen off already. The fact that it didn't happen means Quinn wasn't getting hurt by the lightning attacks at all.

That certainly was the case, and it was because Quinn was using the second stage of Qi to coat his body and block attacks.

"I see now. You're a vampire that can use Qi; you really are special, aren't you?" Jake smiled. "I know you guys have great healing capabilities, but if I am not wrong, Qi seems to slow or cease that ability. I didn't really want to hurt you, which is why I didn't use Qi in my own attacks, but do you think this fight would be fair if you were to use Qi and I didn't?"

'Fair?' Quinn thought in his head. 'Do you know how much I'm holding back? My shadow powers, blood control and celestial powers...I also have a lot more to show.' Quinn wanted to retort but only smiled, not saying it out loud.

It seemed he was right about this. The fight had set a spark in him, wanting him to see how far he could go. Another thing to note was that he didn't feel like the opponent was coming after his life or was trying to injure him; rather, it was more of a friendly match.

The intensity of Green pigment in Jake's eyes began to turn dense as they glowed more, and Quinn could sense the Qi rising around and in the latter's body.

'This level of Qi… is at the same level as Hilston's…what monster am I about to face?' Quinn thought. However, he continued to smile, and the red in his eyes started to glow even more as well.

Just then-

"SIR!! THERE'S AN EMERGENCY!!" A unit of five Vampire Corps members ran and landed right where the assessment was taking place.

"What's wrong?" Mitchell asked.

Before any of the five members could respond, a loud explosion went off in the distance. It came not far from the barracks, and upon closer attention, one could even hear the clamour of an ongoing battle.

"It's a beast horde!" One of the panicked vampires said, and after a moment of pause, he added, "It's a level four beast horde."

Hearing this, Jake immediately stopped his attack and went back by Vicky's side.

"Has this camp ever dealt with a level four beast horde before?" He turned his attention towards Mitchell.

"No." The latter shook his head.

"Well, it's a good thing that we are here then. My mother and I will do our best to minimise the damage. Go and alert the General." Jake ordered, being quick to act and on his feet. The next second he turned around and looked towards Quinn and the others.

"The rest of you haven't had your assessments yet, right? Well, there is no better chance for you to prove yourself than now. Follow Lieutenant Mitchell onto the field, and show him what you can do. He can base your assessment score off of this incident."

It didn't take long for Vicky and Jake to disappear as they headed off in the direction of the battle. Quinn, for a second, thought about chasing them, but instead, he decided to stay put with the others. It wasn't like they were running off, and he will get answers from them soon anyway.

'But, what the hell is a Beast Horde in the first place?' Quinn thought.
