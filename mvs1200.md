# Chapter 1200 One of them

With the simultaneous Dalki attacks going on everywhere, all three main factions were suffering. The battles that were being held in space, soon went toward the planets. It seemed like the Dalki weren’t really fond of space combat either as they believed in their own physical prowess.

It had been the same back during the first war. A large mothership, black in colour but odd shaped like a blimp had been used to reach Earth. Whatever attacks they had used against this mothership had been ineffective. Once that large ship had been close enough, it had fired out several black pods to invade their homeplanet.

It was nearly the same this time, the main difference was that the pods were landing on the beast planets instead. Having to evaluate everything that was going on was Sach, the new Supreme Commander. The giant Bertha ship had drifted towards the centre most planet of all those that belonged to their group at the moment.

’It’s just like before, even after several years we are unable to create anything that can damage that damned ship. They aren’t exactly holding themselves up in those either. Are they pursuing an overall goal by taking over the beast planets or do they just do it, to cut off our resources?’

"Jane, have there been any reports about any strong signals, or any sighting of Dalki four spiked or higher in the Earthborn group?" Sach asked, listening in to the constant reports that were coming from each of the planets. Not one of them was doing well at the moment. The silver lining was that they were able to hold their position, but for how long? A week, a month? That wasn’t even accounting any rogue elements...

"Negative, none of the leader type Dalki as you refer to them have shown up on any of our planets. However, I feel the need to point out that there are those struggling more than others. Planet Caladi didn’t have any strong forces stationed there since it’s been classified as a green portal planet."

"Careful estimation predicts that they won’t be able to last to the end of this day until they are taken over. Their leader has already requested help from the Cursed faction. I got word from General Nathan that he should be arriving soon with two army groups. Should I send them to reinforce Planet Caladi?"

Thinking about this, Sach was wondering if there was any point fighting for Planet Caladi and a few other green portal planets. They made for ideal living areas for the humans and also good training spots, but they were also planets that strategically speaking could be called expandable. He also had the words of the vice Cursed faction leader on his mind.

With all the other planets struggling as well, Sach had to agree with Sam’s suggestion, they couldn’t save them all...

"Tell Nathan and his group to escort everyone from Planet Caladi to one of these planets." Sach ordered as four planets lit up on the screen. They were close to each other, and had high tier beasts. They weren’t exactly safe for civilians to live on, but in such a critical time they couldn’t be too choosy. The military needed to concentrate their resources and protect what was most important.

"When he’s done on Planet Caladi, I want him and the two army groups to continue with escort duty. Assign him two of the Bertha ships and get as many people off those planets as possible, before you bring them here."

Jane saluted and immediately proceeded to send the messages out to all the others but there was something worrying the Supreme Commander. Sach was sure that the Dalki were smart enough to launch a simultaneous attack on all of their planets, they might also have information on what planets were most important to the humans. In turn they would send strong forces to make sure to get rid of them.

Perhaps, they might have even predicted their current course of actions, but it was all the better for them. The Dalki would have to leave behind a token army if they wanted to claim each of those beast planets, causing humanity to fight against fewer Dalki in the end.

Unfortunately, they had yet to see any Dalki leaders, so where were they?

After Jane had finished sending and giving out the orders she looked back at Sach, noticing he wanted to ask something.

"According to our reports, which planet is currently facing the most trouble? All of the Shelters on them are A rank, so there shouldn’t be too much difference. Unless there is a terrain issue." Sach asked, hoping he could perhaps pinpoint the location of them doing this.

"The planet that is struggling the most is Killor. It’s a red portal planet that is mostly covered in snow and forest. However the terrain shouldn’t be a problem and actually the forces there are greater than anywhere else." Jane reported.

"Greater there than anyone else? Is the faction living there particularly strong?" Sach was a little confused.

"No, that is the planet that Head General Samantha is currently on. She has taken some of Oscar’s strongest people with her, yet they are struggling more than any other."

That was the answer that Sach was looking for. This was the planet that he needed to be at the most.

——

The large Bertha ship stayed in orbit away from the four planets. If one was to look through the glass in the command centre they could see two of the planets in the distance in view. If they zoomed in, they could also see two of the Dalki mother ships.

They would often stay in orbit after dropping the black pods. Seeing this was also the confirmation that the Dalki forces far surpassed humanity’s expectations. When they had come to attack Earth, there had only been one of them.

Sach had just landed on Planet Killor. He had made sure to arrive on a part of the planet, where no battles were taking place. Since the fortresses were well guarded and stronger, ability users were prepared to fight off the Dalki. Seemingly realising that, the Dalki would come in groups to test certain things, and after a short battle retreat.

Once he arrived at the Shelter, the first thing Sach noticed was the state of the east wall. It was worse than he had thought. There was a large hole that had been slightly fixed with the Earth ability. In its current state it wouldn’t even hold against the weakest of Dalki attacks.

Bunkers had been built a few hundred feet away from the Shelters as well. He could see scout groups heading out and returning, but the worst thing was that snow around the area was covered in blood. Red blood.

His first destination was wherever Samantha was. A soldier quickly pointed out the way and on his way Sach was wondering one thing. Was the fact that this planet was performing worse than the others related to the Dalki focusing more effort into it... or was this a result of her not really being in the right state of mind?

Reaching the north wall, he could see Head General Samatnha there, in a makeshift tent, looking at a digital map at the place.

"Supreme Commander Sach, I’m sorry that I couldn’t greet you when you were coming in, but we are in a dire situation." Samantha reported as she briefly looked up, to which he just replied with an ’At ease’.

Coming up to the map, Sach looked at everything it displayed, which was the locations they had seen the Dalki. She wasn’t the only one in the room. There were also four strategists of war, they weren’t great in strength, but had helped Oscar many times.

"Perhaps you could shed some light on our situation. Whenever our scouts have discovered a few Dalki scanning out the area, we have followed them, only to end up led into a trap time after time. No matter how cautious we are, or how we change up our tactics, they managed to trick my man!"

"At the same time, even when badgering up, and moving our defences to one side of the wall. It’s as if they know which wall we borrowed our powers from. They seem to have great insight into our moves."

Now, Sach understood how the wall had been damaged, if the Dalki were coming from the west section, then Samantha needed to make the choice to reinforce the wall with troops from the north, south or east walls for support. She had done so from the east wall, the wall furthest away, and yet somehow the Dalki had been ready with a strong force attacking from there.

"Am I the issue?...." Samantha couldn’t help but ask it out loud. It wasn’t as if she was unaware, that what happened to her father had messed her up. Usually she would be quite good at tactical warfare, being even more alert than Sach.

"No, the issue isn’t you at all." Sach said, pivoted his foot and swung his other leg out, slamming it at one of the strategist’s head, hooking him by the back of the neck. With sheer power, he brought the man’s head down and pinned it onto the ground.

That when they could see it, while the strategist was stuck under Sach’s foot strugglin his eyes were glowing red.

"He was a...V?" Samantha realised. "But how did you know?"

******

# Chapter 1201 The Dalki leaders

The V under Sach’s leg continued to struggle. It attempted to push off the ground using its two hands. Despite using all its strength, it was unable to move at all. It was clear one person was overpowering the other with ease. Sach was already strong before. He had a well trained body and good beast gear on. Now that he was a vampire himself, there would be very few vampires out there that would be able to overpower him.

’The question is, what to exactly do with this strategist?’ Sach thought. ’Even those on the Cursed ship were unable to break them using their Vampire powers, so I doubt I would be able to do anything. We could capture them, but what use is that? There is only one thing we can do.’

Sach applied a sudden pressure on his leg. It was quick and decisive, a small crunching sound was heard, and the vampire was no longer moving or making any noise.

"Strategist Om!" One of the other strategists called out. "He’s....dead. Even if you are the supreme commander, how could you do this."

Om looked like he would run over to his fallen comrade, but Samantha quickly pulled him back before Sach could do anything.

"Did you not see it? Sach explained. He was a V. The reason why all your elaborate plans weren’t working, why it felt like they were always one step ahead of you, was all because this person was working with the Dalki."

There was silence in the room for a few seconds. The strategist was someone who had been in the military for a while. They were even by Oscar’s side at times. It was hard for them to believe such a thing. However, they started to remember the video of Head general Innu being a V as well. If he was one, then it meant that anyone could have been one and was really working for the other side.

"I saw his red eyes," Samantha claimed, now looking at the body on the floor. "Without a doubt, he was a V, but how did you know he was one? She asked for a second time, hoping he wouldn’t avoid the question.

"That isn’t important right now. This shelter is struggling more than all the other Shelters. If it was because of the V, perhaps they have big plans for this place, which also means there could be more. I want you to take me to every group, every platoon to see if they are anymore. Let’s not waste any time."

Head general Samantha went along with the Supreme commander, showing him every platoon and area. Most of them were clear as Sach didn’t show any actions towards her people, but it wasn’t the case everywhere.

On the south wall, Sach discovered a V. This time, rather than attempting to capture it, he quickly went up behind the vampire and started to subdue it by strangulation, getting it in a type of chokehold. As the vampire struggled for its life and tried to summon all of its powers, its eyes would turn red, and they could see that they were V.

Another area where the V was discovered was in one of the bunkers part of the scouting team. Where Sach had done the same again. It was clever of them. The scout could inform them of when they were spotted before all of the others, especially since they had superior eyesight and hearing.

Walking back after having checked the area, Samantha couldn’t take it anymore and grabbed Sach on the shoulder as they walked through the snow.

"Tell me, how did you know they were V? If it’s something you know, you could share it with all of us." Samantha pleaded. If she had this skill, maybe she wouldn’t have lost as many people as they already had.

"When the Cursed faction came to see me and healed me, they offered me to go aboard their ship for a short while. I accepted, and during that time, they taught me a lot of things about the V. I know their weaknesses, their strengths and how to spot them. Unfortunately, it is not something I can teach you overnight for one, and for the second, it’s not for me to teach.

"They told me because it is a desperate time. However, I must respect their wishes. Perhaps they are worried that these techniques will be used against them in the future. Which is understandable." Sach explained although everything he said was untrue. He could tell because he was now one of them, and his nose could pinpoint their smell.

Still, the other vampires also should have been able to tell Sach was one as well. If it wasn’t for the special spray that Logan had produced and handed to Sach. After using the spray with Owen, and with no one knowing what Sach was, they thought it could come in handy for him.

Honestly, perhaps at another point and time, Sach’s actions would be criticised but just like with the first war, when those who were weak were pushed aside, as the strong fought for their lives for Earth, no one said anything.

"Samantha, Samantha, your back! We have urgent news. There’s been a strong reading of a Dalki that has just landed. It’s possibly one of the leaders you asked for!" A man with glasses at the gate yelled.

’They must have been informed that the V here are dying, which means they know that there is a vampire here but who have they sent?’ Sach thought.

"Are we going to go out and attack them!" Samantha asked, clenching her fist.

"That is not like you at all. We have no idea who this Dalki is. Remember what happened last time? You were the one who called out my mistake, so I have to call out yours. Wait until we get more information."

While at the Shelter, Sach was still getting information on what was going on all over the beast solar system. He had learnt that Owen was once again engaged in combat with the same four spiked Dalki as last time.

Owen had done well against it before, but maybe that was due to it not knowing about its powers.

It was then that the whole shelter felt a slight rumble beneath all of them. The ground vibrated slightly, but there was no loud bang or huge explosion in the area as such. Still, Sach could hear it more than the others and rushed as quickly as he could.

Now standing on the wall, far in the distance in the snow, they could see a Dalki with wings and a single horn that had partly been broken.

"One Horn!" Samantha screamed, but Sach soon pulled her back.

"Samantha, if you can’t keep your emotions in check, then I am going to have to temporarily relieve you of your position."

It was strange. One Horn was just standing there in the snow, on his own, as if he was waiting for them to attack.

"We aren’t strong enough," Sach said, knowing that even with his vampire powers, he couldn’t beat a five spiked Dalki.

"Then what do you want us to do? Just sit here, wait here and stall. Stall for what?"

It was then that a message had been sent out to Sach, directly from Sam. About the Cursed faction being under attack from none other than the great Blade family.

’What in the world is going on? Sach thought. The timing couldn’t have been worse. The only thing he was thankful for was the fact that Nathan and his group had gotten out there before they had attacked.

’Quinn is currently at the Cursed faction planets, but will he now be rushing back to save his group? Or will he choose to try to get rid of the threat first? The good news is, with One Horn here, Owen dealing with the other leaders. I should have the strongest Dalki in front of me. I’ll just have to keep him here as long as possible, to let Quinn do what he needs to do. He’s dealt with many Dalki before, so he can do the same again.’ Sach thought, but all of this would be great if One Horn was the strongest Dalki they had.

******

# Chapter 1202 A Penalty

The others in the room with Quinn were also quick on the uptake. One teleporter not working could just have just been a coincidence, two not working however indicated that something was wrong. Jammed teleporters were one of the first signs that an attack was incoming. The Dalkis’ ability to do such a thing was one of the reasons they had been warned to stop relying on the teleporters.

"Inform all of the Cursed planets to prepare themselves for an attack!" Helen immediately ordered. She was unsure if the other planets were affected, but there was always the worry that something big was on the horizon and it was better to be safe than sorry. "Make sure that the Daisy faction is prepared as well. I might not be able to give an update straight away, tell the Cursed faction leaders to take command until we get the situation under control!"

There was no need for Helen to say it twice, as everyone had been getting ready for the war ahead of them. Quickly everyone inside the teleporter room had stepped out to look into the distance.

Just like Earth, the Daisy planet also had four seasons it went through. Currently, it was undergoing its version of ’spring’. There was a clear blue sky, and thanks to that Quinn and the others could clearly see the large black blip, and many pods dropping down from the mothership. Helen could only stare at it frozen in place, as the black pods reached the surface a few moments later.

’A mothership here of all places?! Have the Dalki decided to use their full force on the Cursed faction? But why, what do they have to gain? Did they know that Quinn was here?’ The woman wondered.

Soon though, reports about similar situations occurring on the other planets came in and Helen was beginning to realise the true horror of their actual situation. Not only was the Cursed faction being attacked but at the same time this was happening, the other two major groups as well. What was worrying her most though, was the fact that the other planets had said that they could see a mothership hovering over each one.

For the first time she was at a bit of a loss of what to do, before she finally said something.

"The Travellers, some of them are still out hunting. If they meet with the Dalki they’re done for!"

At the moment, Peach, one of Daisy’s older sisters, was also standing by her side and was the one giving her an update on the situation with the other planets.

"Helen, we don’t have time to take care of them. Right now we need to try to gather as much information as possible before deciding on our next course of action. I’m afraid the only thing we can do is hope that they come back in one piece. I’m sure they must have seen the mothership before us so they would be travelling back as we speak."

Although she didn’t like leaving things up to fate, Helen had to admit that her sister was right. This was war at a scale none of them had expected. This wasn’t the time to save a few at the cost of countless others.

Looking at Quinn she was wondering what his plans were, perhaps he could call for help from the Cursed faction. However, she just witnessed him standing in place with a look of great concern, but it almost looked as if he wasn’t looking at the Dalki ship itself but something else.

Helen was correct. At the moment, Quinn was staring at the sudden notification screen that had appeared the moment he had set foot outside of the building and laid eyes on the mothership.

[A new quest has been received]

[As leader of the Cursed faction you must act like one]

[Stop the Dalki from taking over more than half of the Cursed planets]

[0/10]

In total the Cursed faction owned eighteen planets, which meant that Quinn could allow nine of them to be taken over or destroyed. He could see that the number would increase as each planet was taken over, but the Quest message didn’t stop there.

[To complete the quest, destroy over half of the motherships]

[0/10]

’Both of these messages look like they go hand in hand but not quite. Just because I destroy the motherships, the Dalki that have already been deployed could still take over the planet. I have to make sure that they are protected even after destroying the motherships.’

Lastly there was the last part of the message which was why he stood still for so long.

[Failure to complete the quest will result in a penalty]

[Quest reward]

’A penalty? This is the first time the system has ever assigned such a thing. Why at a time like this? What would the penalty even be? Since the rewards are usually stats and level ups, could it be that it intends to take some of those away?’

This was worrying him more than anything. Without the teleporters, and with how far the other Cursed faction members were, it would take them a long time to even help out in the war. He needed to act fast if he wanted to save those planets.

Although he might not die, failing the Quest could lead to him getting weaker. If the system was able to give him stats and levels making him stronger than it stood to reason that could just as easily take them away.

’I think the same.’ Vincent agreed. ’As you know, the system was based on a game. It uses AI that assigns Quests based on the information around it. The thing is I never thought a penalty would show up. In the game itself there were penalties each time you would die. Of course, in real life if you die you don’t get a second chance so I never thought I would see this.’

’What type of penalties did the user get from dying?’ Quinn asked, thinking that they might be similar.

’It was pretty random and could range from a loss of items or abilities, to the loss of levels, stats to just a simple loss of experience points.’

None of those options sounded good to Quinn. He had long since wanted to stop relying on the system. It was odd how quick it had allowed him to strengthen himself in certain areas. Even without its help Quinn could be considered to be plenty strong now, but to fight the likes of Arthur, Hilston or the Dalki leaders, he needed all the help he could get.

"Helen, I’ll go out and look for those Travelers that are still outside. Using my shadow powers I am the ideal person to do it, but I won’t be able to bring them back to the Shelter, I have something else I need to do. I’ll carry on looking for the others instead."

’"What are you saying, what are you planning to do Quinn?" Helen asked.

Looking at the large ship, and reading the Quest again, it was clear as day what he needed to do. He needed to find a way to destroy a ship that couldn’t even be taken down by energy blasts.

’The outside is probably too strong, so the only way is to look for a way to sabotage it from the inside.’ Quinn concluded. The system hadn’t given him any Quests that had been completely impossible, so he hoped it hadn’t started now. Then again, this was also the first time it had brought up a penalty...

"Assemble a team that is willing to go out with me, I’ll help the others on the way, and they can update you on the Dalki situation once I’ve taken down that thing. Then we can focus on the rest." Quinn ordered.

’The rest? That thing? He can’t be planning to go from one planet to the next and take out the motherships, could he?’ Helen was shocked. The amount of black pods that continued to rain down was testimony that there were far more Dalki on the planet than any of them had ever seen. It would be troublesome enough to just deal with them, but it looked like Quinn had made his mind.

Helen too wanted to save the Travelers. The only thing she could hope was that Quinn could come to his senses once they were on the outside.

As the leader of the Daisy faction she quickly called for the group of twelve individuals that would be sent with Quinn to get the Travelers that were outside and to bring them back information. These twelve were the ones who had been rewarded with the blood weapons.

Now that there was no way to deliver the rest of the weapons, he left them all in the hands of Helen to distribute them among those she trusted. Daisy was one of the strongest factions out of the others so they probably needed it the least, but it was useless not to use them and hoard them at the moment.

Just as Quinn was ready to move out, he could feel something. The bond he had with his people on the Cursed ship. He could tell that they were in the middle of a battle and it felt that it wasn’t an easy one.

’They’re all so far away that I can’t pinpoint who’s who. It could be Alex and the others, the Dalki have invaded there as well, or maybe those on the Cursed ship?’

Thinking about this, Quinn was hesitating whether he should check in with the others, but that’s when the Quest line updated.

[1/10 Planets have been taken over by the Dalki]

’What the...’

# Chapter 1203 Climb
The organisation of the Shelter during this state of emergency and the gathering of the twelve who had been honoured with receiving the blood weapons had taken some time, but at most it was an hour or so. At the same time, the pods had stopped dropping from the large mothership and the group had yet to experience any such attack, which was why the sudden message as he was about to leave was so troubling to Quinn.

’What could have happened for one of the planets to have already been taken over so fast? Did they send out an advance party before we found out about the Dalki? Even so, it should be impossible for nobody to report anything about it!’ Quinn thought.

On top of that, he was sure the system would have informed him with a quest like it did so before if it was the case. Quinn was with the twelve others ready to leave at any moment and was at the north gate.

"Helen, has any of the planets reported anything about being on the brink of being overrun?" Quinn asked, speaking through a receiver in the mask he was wearing. Helen was currently inside the base trying to formulate plans. Despite the calls and information that was coming in, she answered immediately when it was him.

"I’m not sure, but we are unable to contact any of the members or faction leaders stationed on Demakera. According to some outside ships observing the situation, the Shelter looks to have been destroyed." Helen reported.

Hearing this, Quinn thought back to the information that he had seen about the planets the Cursed faction owned. Demakera had a B ranked Shelter. It shouldn’t have fallen this quickly, unless a strong number of Dalki were there or perhaps a strong spiked Dalki was present.

"Sam suggested that we concentrate our forces on a few of the more important planets. Otherwise it looks like the Dalki will be able to slowly lower our numbers." Helen reported.

It was a good plan, but there was a major issue with it.

’If they do that, what about my Quest? If the Cursed faction retreats to the other planets then it will make it easier for them to take over. I’ll fail the Quest once we lose possession of ten planets! No, I can’t tell Helen not to go through with the order. I can’t risk peoples’ lives just because I could receive a penalty from this damned system!’

It was another race against time for Quinn. The evacuation of those in the Shelter would take a while anyway, but there was one thing the Cursed faction leader could do to complete the task. Destroy ten motherships before they were able to take over the planets.

"Quinn, I’m afraid I have some more bad information for you. I have sent over a video that you need to look over. Whatever you decide to do I’ll understand." Helen said.

Knowing that it would be important if she wanted him to watch it, he immediately started. It was a recording of livestream but not just any livestream, one that Void and Bonny had taken about how the Cursed faction’s ship was under attack.

’Human’s.... Not Dalki and they don’t look like V either.’

After listening to the video for a little while, he understood just who exactly had attacked the Cursed faction ship and it was none other than the Blade family.

’Hilston!’ Quinn stepped on the ground so hard, that his foot sank several inches into it.

’Quinn, your people need you here right now.’ Vincent acted as his voice of reason. ’One planet has already been taken over. There is a good chance that more will follow. Who knows how dire the consequences will be for failing the Quest, in any case it will leave you weaker!’

"I would hate to be in your shoes right now, but know this, during the time I have been with you, you weren’t the only one who has grown stronger. Trust in your friends, who treasure the Cursed faction ship as much as you do. You can always use your ability to arrive there as support, but once you leave here is nobody you could use to quickly get back.’

Vincent was right, if those that had a close bond with Quinn were in serious trouble and close to death, he would be able to feel it, and although he could tell members of his family were fighting hard, it didn’t seem like any of them had been injured to such a degree.

On top of that, with each planet the Dalki took over, it spelt death to the ones living on them.

———

On Planet Demakera, smoke was rising from the destroyed Shelter. The walls had fallen to pieces and blood was everywhere. There didn’t seem to be a single human survivor, and even the secret underground Shelter had been torn and taken apart.

Standing, in the middle of what was now a large pile of rubble was an odd looking Dalki wearing a nice buttoned up shirt.

’The others are more war hungry than I thought.’ Graham looked to his left, and could see a human had been lifted up by a Dalki, soon squeezing its head, finishing it off on the spot. ’It seems a lot of my brethren are just following their natural instincts, urging them to kill whatever they see. I wonder why some seem to be less affected than others. Well, I hope to find the answer soon. I hate to rely on others but this time I will have to.’

’This Shelter was easier than I expected. I guess that means I have run into the weaker of the three groups.’ Graham thought.

———

Quinn had made his decision. After watching the video a bit more, he had seen that Nate had arrived and with him the tide had turned slightly. Seeing his confident smile on camera, Quinn chose to believe in his friends, and was off.

Using his Shadow travel, the ten women and two men with blood weapons were traveling with him.

They went through the large meadows, filled with flowers and trees, heading directly towards the mothership. In the shadow the other twelve were quite nervous about the whole thing.

"What is going to happen if we run into a large group? Isn’t it too dangerous with just the few of us?" A young man named Yag questioned nervously. He held a small axe as his blood weapon in his hand, while his beast weapon, another axe, was on his back. All of them had their blood weapons ready, waiting for the signal to pop out of the shadows and fight off the Dalki.

"Don’t say those types of things." Iree lectured him. "Everyone knew this would happen, and at least we have the privilege of having the Cursed faction leader with us, not to mention these new weapons. You’ve seen their power, as long as we use them we stand a chance no matter how big the group of Dalki are!"

Still, despite her encouraging words, it was common knowledge that a strong group of ten or more was needed to take on even a single spiked Dalki. Of course it depended on that group’s strength. Even hundreds of regular ability users might be unable to defeat such a foe, much less a stronger one.

They had no idea what awaited them, they would have to trust in their own stamina with their increased strength as they got closer and closer to a fight to the death.

Even through the Shadow travel Quinn could smell the scent of blood. Travelling to where it led him, they found one of the hunting groups of this area. The twelve griefed at the sight of five people having lost their lives, none of them looked to have died a pleasant death.

Quinn quickly moved on, and although it was clear that some wanted to check if someone might have survived, they didn’t dare say anything as they saw the scary look on Quinn’s face as he continued to move. Eventually, following another scent of blood, he moved to a new area, this one had the sounds of people fighting.

Once they came closer, they could see ten survivors with five others already dead. They must have been three hunting groups that had banded together. Unfortunately, they had encountered five Dalki who they were currently fighting with. The Dalki were injured to different degrees but not a single one of them was dead.

"Everyone out, don’t let them kill anyone else!" Iree shouted, gripping her spear tightly.

The next second, all of them exited the shadow. The twelve of them got into position, intending to protect the injured yet still surviving ten Travelers. Yag swung his axe at one of the Dalki who hit the weapon, which dropped on the ground.

’Damn it!’ He cursed internally while taking a step back and getting out his beast weapon. ’How are we meant to defeat these things? These weapons may be strong but they only power up once they absorb Dalki blood, but I can’t even hit the damn thing!’

As Yag was shaking, nearly falling over, a Iree came over stabbing the Dalki right in the stomach. Soon, the weapon started to light up with great energy, and pushing forward again, like a blast of energy, the Dalki was hit and blasted away with a type of red aura.

’I can’t believe I called this weapon a piece of crap!’ Iree thought while looking at it, but the Dalki, now spewing with green blood, had gotten up again, and was moving towards them.

"You’ll pay for this!"

Taking a step forward, for a second it could see an axe. The Dalki had no time to dodge the weapon as it lodged into his skull, piercing through his hard skin and killing it on the spot.

"Yag?" Iree questioned looking over her shoulder, but instead she could see Quinn standing there, his gauntlets covered in green blood and had just gotten out of a throwing position.

"What happened to the..." That’s when she could see, in the moments they were fighting against a single Dalki. Quinn had already dealt with the other four quickly, and had just killed off the fifth one.

"I’m heading off, some of you escort the Travellers back, the rest will come with me." Quinn ordered, as the mothership was getting closer and closer.

******

# Chapter 1204 Grinding
Iree was too busy trying to help out Yag that she was unable to witness what had occurred, but the others had done. Because they didn’t even get the chance to help or fight. As soon as Quinn went out from his shadow travel, the first thing he did was leap up in the air, propelling himself forward.

The Dalki were still engaged in combat with the others.

Quinn’s hands were covered in blood and started to spin like drills. The second his feet landed on the floor, he could dash forward, hitting two of them directly in the head finishing them on the spot. A third Dalki was seen trying to attack, but with a strong thigh kick, the leg caved in, breaking its bone and making it collapse down to one knee.

A kick destroying a Dalki’s bones was almost unheard of. Soon the other was dealt with quickly as well.

The others were watching with awe. They had heard rumours of how strong Quinn was, yet it was hard to really imagine.

All of them were high ranking Travellers, sure the Dalki they were going against were only one spike, but they knew how hard it was to fight against even one spike.

The first thing the others did was check for wounds on the survivors. There was a healer in the group, which made it easier. If one was seriously injured, then their travel back would be worse as they were slowed down.

During this time, Quinn stayed with them, it was only a few minutes, but they felt like hours for him. Iree noticed that all Quinn was doing was staring at the mothership.

’Still, only one planet has been taken over so far. This means that it’s most likely that a strong Dalki had appeared on that planet. That gives me a bit of hope, but now that they have finished with that planet. They will be moving, and I need to be moving as well.’

"Quinn, do you really plan to go to the mother ship? How are you even thinking of getting there?" Iree asked.

The Dalki mothership was in the planet’s atmosphere, hovering above ground around the same height where clouds would be on earth.

"The Dalki came out of there. If they want to travel to the other planets after taking over this one, there has to be a way to return. Perhaps we will find out our answer as we get closer." Quinn replied.

"So you don’t have a plan, is what I’m hearing?" Iree replied, shaking her head.

The truth was Quinn did have a few tricks up his sleeve, but he would rather not use them if he could.

"I want to help," Iree said. "When we took the weapons, it wasn’t just for show. We have fought on this planet every day, and now we need to protect it. If an attack was to happen, we never thought you would be here. If you weren’t here, then we would have to do everything ourselves anyway. You see, this faction is probably safer than most because of the way the Shelter was built.

"But that’s only true if we stay in the Shelter. The plants around the Shelter aren’t just for show. I’m sure you also know what Helen and her sister’s abilities are. All those flowers and the vines on the wall can all be used for weapons. It’s probably the strongest Shelter in existence, but that’s where the problem lies."

"There’s too much risk to leave the shelter," Quinn answered.

"Exactly, so this group that has been sent out is probably the only group that will be sent out. Helen will probably decide to send as many of those from the weaker planets here. They can expand the Shelter and fortify this planet. To even do that, we need to clear this place, get rid of the Dalki that are on here." Iree explained. "You...you aren’t planning to stay here, are you? You have others you need to get to. That’s why you’re in such a rush."

When Iree thought about this, she was referring to the Cursed faction members. She was unaware that Quinn needed to head to the other planets as well.

"After seeing you fight, our best chance is with you. As the Dalki take over the other planets, more will come to this one, and I don’t even think Daisy can hold out. Quinn, you are strong, but there are probably hundreds of Dalki underneath that ship. Maybe you can beat them all, but how long would that take, and maybe there are even more inside. Bring us along the whole way, and let us help you."

Quinn could tell that these were good strong fighters. This was why they had been awarded the blood weapons in the first place. Still, going up against groups of Dalki, this was something only he was capable of due to his speed and shadow ability.

’Quinn, this whole quest is a race against time.’ Vincent explained. ’Think about it. There is probably a Dalki leader out there who has taken out the first planet. The shelters seem to be holding out for a while, but now they are most likely on their way to the next one. The way I see it, it’s impossible to protect all the planets, especially with Helen moving her forces.

’So you need to destroy ten mother ships before the Dalki takes over ten planets. They will be using everything they have got, so we should take every little help that is offered our way as well.’

Everyone looked like they were now ready to move out, so Quinn had a few words to say to them all.

"Whoever wishes to go back to the Shelter, feel free to do so. I will continue heading towards the mothership to take it down. I will do my best to save any travellers we find on the way there but will not be escorting them back. It should be relatively safe for them since we have seen no Dalki on the way here."

The others started to discuss amongst themselves. They thought this was a simple rescue mission. They didn’t realise they were going to go Into the heart of the enemy territory.

This was too much for a lot of them, and they had chosen to return to the Shelter. Yag and Iree continued to stay with Quinn. While some of those with blood weapons had chosen to leave, but surprisingly a couple of Travellers who were hunting wanted to come along as well.

Quinn could see it though, they were focused on revenge, perhaps from their fallen comrades that had been killed. Anger sometimes was a good tool to use if one could control it.

In all, ten people had decided to stay with Quinn, and those that left Quinn took the blood weapons back, handing them to those that would stay with him.

"It’s now time for me to tell you the truth about the weapons," Quinn said. "As you all know, I am what you guys call a V. I will tell you the truth. Helen or I was going to tell you the details later. These weapons were made for us, which means that they aren’t only activated by Dalki blood but human blood as well. Using your own blood, you can activate the weapons. The time they will be active for is limited though, so don’t do so until you need to."

It was too late for them to be surprised by anything anymore, and from those that remained, they were just happy that they had a better way to help fight.

Travelling with Quinn once more, they ran into a few more Travellers and groups. In order for them to get used to the blood weapons, Quinn allowed them to fight two Dalki on their own. The group of ten teamed up into two groups of five. With their blood weapons, beast gear and abilities, they were far stronger than they could ever imagine. For the first time, they had defeated two of the Dalki, without losing a life.

As for Quinn, he had dealt with eight on his own, taking them down fast and quickly. They carried on moving forward, leaving the Travellers to head back to the faction on their own. This far out, there didn’t seem to be any more Travelers, at least ones that were alive.

Instead, they had found scout groups, of around five Dalki or more, in different areas. With these groups, Quinn would take them out just as easily as he did the others. After taking out five of these groups, they were inching forward.

’Is it really good to take out so many of these groups? Won’t they know that we are coming then?’ Yag asked.

Iree, thought the same thing. Although these scouting groups were on the way, they could have avoided fighting them. It might have taken a while if they waited, but it was only further proof how much of a rush he was in.

Of course, it was quicker for Quinn to kill them than travel around them, but that wasn’t the only reason he was fighting them head on. Soon a familiar message had popped up.

[You have levelled up]

[You are now level 68]

[You have gained one stat point]

Quinn had noticed it during his fighting. Killing beasts gave him so little exp that Quinn knew it was a waste of time to level up from grinding. The only thing that would level him up these days was hard life and death situations, where the quest would reward him an instant level up. Or extremely high tier beasts at the Demi-god tier level or the Demon tier level.

However, there was one more thing, killing Dalki. Even the one spiked Dalki gave Quinn a large amount of exp. If he wanted to level up through grinding, then this was the best way.

’Level 68, will I evolve again at level 70? Maybe to the next evolution. If I can do that...maybe I have a chance.’

Finally, they had reached a large hill of a meadow, and the shadow of the large Dalki ship was cast above them. Getting out of the shadow travel. They were now lying flat on their bellies and had crawled to the tip of the hill.

Looking over, they could see just as Iree had said. Hundreds of Dalki, and these weren’t just one spiked like they were before, but here Quinn could also see what he was looking for.

’I knew they would have one. The first Dalki I ever met did.’ Quinn thought.

At the back, guarded by Dalki, were several ships rather than pods. The first Dalki Quinn had ever faced had arrived in one. It was time to take down the mothership.

******

# Chapter 1205 Getting in
The group spent a few minutes observing how the Dalki camp operated, checking if there was anyone in charge. After all, the Dalki they had encountered so far had been moving in scout groups, yet the ones present had yet to charge into the Shelter. It was almost as if they were waiting for something... or someone.

’They have ten of those black ships that look capable of flight. Why are there so few of them? Will the mothership land once they have taken over the Shelter? Are those ships just used for emergencies?’ Quinn wondered as he looked at them.

The ships were quite small but they looked agile and fast. He estimated that no more than three humans would be able to fit inside. As for the Dalki with their larger bodies, it appeared to have been designed for a single pilot, perhaps two if two smaller ones squeezed together.

’The outer shell is supposed to be so hard, that the human race was unable to take it down in the last war, but surely there has to be something inside powering it up. I guess in the end I’m just going to have to steal one of the ships and go with the flow.’

In total, Quinn counted around two hundred Dalki. While this number was far from the tens of thousands of people in the human Shelter, for them it was quite a large number. Besides, if numbers alone could deal with that alien race, humanity wouldn’t have suffered as much as they had in the first war.

’I could use Shadow cloak, but there are a few dozen two spiked Dalki among them. Once I steal the ship and set off, they’ll just immediately pounce on the ship and bring it down. If I take care of them first, then I could use my soul weapon. As long as there’s no more strong ones I should be able to fight them all.’ Quinn started to go through his options.

’It would give me a great exp boost, but how long would that take? By that time, they might have already taken over two more planets...’

"Use us!" Iree insisted once she noticed Quinn earnestly thinking about their next step.

"You just need to steal one of those ships to get to the mothership, right? As long as we’re not fighting in hopes to win but to survive, I’m sure the ten of us can help you achieve that goal!" While Iree seemed determined to give up her life, the rest of her group didn’t look as confident.

"Are you expecting to sacrifice yourself?" Quinn asked.

"Of course." Iree answered without hesitation. "In the grand scheme of things we’re just ten lives. Everytime we go out to hunt, we have to deal with the possibility that we might not come back. Now that the Dalki are here, we would have risked our lives anyway. All of us who have agreed to accompany you were aware of that."

"All of us have families and friends back at the Shelter. If we can trade our lives to give you a chance so that they survive, we’ll gladly do so. My only regret would be not seeing the look on those Dalkis’ faces when they realise that they have messed with the wrong group of people!"

Once Iree spoke about saving their loved ones, even the ones behind her all nodded as they found their resolve.

"... fine, but I don’t need you to sacrifice yourselves. As you said, it would be a shame if you didn’t get to enjoy that look on their faces. I just need you guys to cause a distraction and hold out for a little while. I’m able to use my shadow abilities from quite a distance away, so as long as you stay in my line of sight I should be able to protect you for a while longer, and bring you with me." Quinn said.

Iree never had hope she would come out of this, if she did she just needed to see it as an extra. As confident as Quinn was, she didn’t want false hope. Before setting off Quinn had touched each one of them.

Soon, Iree and her people had formulated a plan around their set of abilities and they began their distraction. They appeared on the outer perimeter of the Dalki camp with a bang.

Each of them had activated their blood weapons attacking a line of Dalki in front of them. Blasting them away. Soon after, they started to use their abilities for defensive purposes and had gotten into a special formation. A turtle like the shape of the Romans of the past.

The Dalki were now paying attention to their group, allowing Quinn the chance to make his way to the unguarded ships via Shadow cloak. With all the noise, he didn’t even have to worry about his footsteps making any sound, so he ran at a great speed. The longer he took to reach one, the more likely it was for Iree’s group to die.

The Dalki ship had the shape of a jet, only a hard black exterior as if it was the outside of a volcano. Bumpy rocks and a strong reinforced glass pod where one could enter. Opening up the hatch, Quinn hopped inside.

’Great, it looks like it’s at least the same type of controls as ours.’ Quinn found out with relief, as he started to pilot it. The jet-like ship quickly took to the sky. From his elevation he could see the Iree and the others in the midst of being overwhelmed, their defence down, and the Dalki ready to pounce.

A group of ten Dalki all dived in. At the same time Quinn flew over to their location.

[Skill Shadow on activated]

Now that they were in his line of sight, Quinn could activate his shadow, rising in front of them. The Dalki’s punches turned into almost nothing, powerless as they hit the shadow but it took quite the toll on Quinn’s MC points. He wasn’t able to protect Iree, Yag and the others for too long, otherwise he wouldn’t have enough to to deal with whoever was left in the mothership.

’Quinn, what did you do?’ Iree pondered, staring at the shadow in front of them. They soon readied their weapons again, and when the shadow fell back down, they all struck at the Dalki in front of them. Each strike fed their weapons with more blood, boosting their power even more.

’I have to get them out of there, the higher spiked Dalki, are moving to the front.’ Reaching out his hand, Quinn started to use his Shadow lock on them one by one. The first to go was Iree, followed by Yag, and they continued to disappear In front of the Dalki’s eyes.

"What is going on?!" A two spiked Dalki cried out, as he charged forward at one of the humans. It was a bust of energy, and using all its strength, It punched one of the humans in the stomach lifting them in the air around thirty meters high. The woman’s body had gone limp in an instant, and when she fell on the ground she was unable to stand up.

Quinn used his Shadow lock on them while in the ship, it was a bit more difficult, and he was only able to cast the skill slowly on them. He was unable to reach all in time. Soon, another woman had lost her life, this time to two Dalki, who had attacked her from both sides. Alas, as the last one on the ground, there had been nobody to save her.

Now that the intruders had been dealt with, the Dalki became aware of a certain someone who was flying one of their ships. With the way it was moving, and with no orders given they knew it had to be an enemy.

One of the two spiked Dalki used its strong bulging thighs to jump towards and while it had reached a remarkable height, Quinn had moved up higher, making it fall back to the ground. Before Quinn could move towards the mothership, though, he would have to deal with the other nine ships that the Dalki were in by now.

’I have to do something!’ Quinn looked up, and gathered Qi in his fist. Just enough, and threw a punch hitting the hatch above him, shattering the glass. Then standing up and fighting against the wind resistance, he placed his hands out, bringing out his allies from the Shadow space.

Iree was slightly perplexed to find herself in the front seat and the wind wasn’t helping with that. Meanwhile Quinn stood in the empty space between the back of the small ship, and the seat.

"Pilot the ship while I get these guys off our tail!" Quinn shouted and before she had a chance to say something he had already hopped to the back of the ship. The foremost Dalki ship had already gotten relatively close. Quinn quickly threw out his leg and a blood crescent kick flowed.

Once it hit the wing, it sliced through half of it, yet it was enough to make it fall off balance and crash into the ground beneath. Seeing the others get close, Quinn began to fire off Blood swipes from his hand, hitting them.

He didn’t need to destroy the ships, just make sure they would be unable to fly again.

"Quinn, where do we go? I don’t think the ship is just going to open up for us!" Iree shouted, as the two fo them were soon approaching the back of the large mothership.

"Just keep going forward! When I say jump, just do it!" Quinn shouted back.

Iree wasn’t sure what his plan was, but she had been ready to lay down her life for Quinn, so she wouldn’t question him now. Full force she went to collide into the mothership, and the others seeing this decided to pull back. If they did the same then the ship would simply explode once they crashed.

At the last second, Quinn grabbed Iree and encased the two of them in shadow slowing down their velocity. Getting rid of it, Quinn grabbed onto the outside holding on to the uneven bumpy surface of the mothership.

Finally, using his Shadow travel, he entered through the substance of the Dalki mothership, and the two of them found themselves inside.

"Now, let’s take this damn thing down!"

******

# Chapter 1206 Inside of the Dalki Mothership
The place was quite dark, and was dimly lit. The ground they stood on was made of a black metal material. Taking a few steps it echoed throughout. Iree was slowly taking in everything around her. She couldn’t believe that the two of them had actually infiltrated a Dalki mothership! This was an unprecedented feat!

’This... this is something that will go down in history... and I’m actually a part of it!’ The young woman smiled. ’It really wasn’t a mistake to follow him!’

Iree had always been loyal to the Daisy faction since they had been the ones who had looked after her growing up. After the Cursed faction had taken over, she had actually considered leaving the faction, yet the only reason she hadn’t done so was because Helen had chosen to stay. Now the woman felt that her leader had truly been visionary.

While everything looked foreign to the woman by his side, Quinn seemed to recognise the material on the walls. Unless he was mistaken the Dalki appeared to be using the same stuff as the vampires.

’If it’s truly the same material, how can the outside of their ship be so strong? Have they discovered a new way to use crystals to increase their defences?’ Quinn wondered. ’Whatever the case, now that we’re inside, there should be a way to take this thing down. If Logan isn’t busy, I could link up the mask and use it as a feed. The Dalki command centre should be the optimal target...’

Raising his hand, a few seconds later shadow portals started to open up and those that had been fighting on the ground came out. Three of them fell to their knees and he could see that they had red puffy eyes.

"Claire, Anna, they’re both dead!" One of the females sobbed, tears continued falling down her face, while the other two who had cried did their best to calm her down.

Only then did Quinn realise that for a moment he had completely forgotten that two people had died to allow him to reach the mothership. It would be easy enough to justify his behavior in that he had been too focused on his goal. Perhaps he was just getting used to seeing death around him at this point.

Either way, he now felt upset, yet it was less because of their deaths per se, but more about the fact that the deaths of people who had sacrificed themselves for his sake didn’t make him sad. What’s more he had noticed that he was also feeling a slight hint of relief that at least it hadn’t been someone closer to him.

"I’m sorry. I tried to save you all, but I wasn’t quick enough. I will do whatever I can to make sure that their loved ones will be taken care of if we survive. If I could I would keep all of you in that Shadow space for safety, but I’m afraid that there is a good chance that I will need to use all my powers." The weak smiles on their faces told Quinn that this was a small solace to the humans by his side. Fortunately, nobody blamed him for their deaths... or at least not openly.

Quinn opened his system, checking how many MC cells he had remaining. Unfortunately, he was down to just one third after having protected the group from the initial Dalki attacks using the Shadow on skill. Keeping them in his space would mean he would be unable to use it at all.

"Perhaps we should split up." Iree suggested. "We can cover far more ground in groups of three. If their ships follow the same layout as ours there should be a life support system, generator, engine room and command centre. Taking out any of those should cause the mothership to take a big hit."

"They’ll surely have those places heavily guarded, though! Without Quinn, it would take five of us to contend with a group of Dalki and that’s assuming they are one spike Dalkis!" Yag protested.

"Then don’t take them on." Quinn commented. "If you think you can handle it then do so, but it will be enough as long as you can find out where those rooms are. Just inform me through the communication device and I’ll take care of them. In the meantime I’ll try and create as much noise as I possibly can to distract them."

"Let me come with you, Quinn." Iree requested with a smile. "If you’re busy fighting, you won’t have time to take down the ship, will you?"

Not wasting anymore time they proceeded forward, until they reached a large hallway. There were several different rooms they could go through, and unfortunately the Dalki didn’t have a map lying around. No one had a clue where exactly they were since the mothership was already gigantic from the outside, rivaling a city.

The one thing they were thankful for, was the ship itself didn’t have the population of one. It felt more deserted as they could see nearly no one inside.

Yag went down one of the hallways with a girl named Deni and Bella. Deni had a regular beast dagger in her left hand and the blood dagger in her right one, while Bella had a blunt weapon that looked more like a baseball bat but red in colour since it was her blood weapon. As an elemental user she didn’t have a regular beast weapon. The three of them were slowly creeping around the place, hardly making any movement at all.

"I don’t know if it’s a good thing that we haven’t seen anyone, or a bad thing." Yag whispered.

"Just take it as a good thing." Deni replied. "They’re probably overconfident and have sent out their entire force, leaving behind only a skeleton crew. I guess they never accounted for the possibility that someone might get in."

The three of them had only been separated from the others for around thirty minutes and that’s when they could hear it. A loud bang that went off in the distance, followed by a blearing beeping sound. It wasn’t just one bang, but it was one after the other going off again and again.

"Do you think that’s, Quinn?" Yag asked.

"Well he did say he was going to distract them." Bella answered

The sound of heavy footsteps could be heard there. Yag quickly looked if there was anywhere they could hide, before pulling the two women to the side hallways. Going further down the hallway, they used the frame of one of the door openings to hide themselves behind it.

A Dalki had soon gone past their hiding spot. After waiting for a short while longer, they decided to head in the direction of where the Dalki were going, hoping they could find something. Eventually they came across a strange large room. The room had giant machinery and tracks going somewhere, yet there was no one to man such a thing, and this ’factory’ seemed to be ongoing.

As they followed one of the tracks, they discovered that there were beast crystals on conveyor belts going further in.

"What are they doing with beast crystals?" Deni asked. "Dalki can’t use beast armour, right? I mean, at least I don’t think so."

"Let’s just follow where this goes. This seems like too large an amount of crystals just to be used for their ships. Maybe we’ll know more if we find out what this factory is making or where it goes."

——

The several explosions were of course courtesy of Quinn. Using his Shadow travel, in the Dark space it was quite easy for him to navigate where everything was inside.

The Dalki hadn’t even noticed him before he had found out where the command centre was. There was just one slight problem. There were three Dalki inside. A one spiked Dalki, a two spiked Dalki and lastly the one who should be their leader, a four spiked Dalki.

This was a level of Dalki that Quinn had never faced before, so he didn’t know how hard of a battle this would prove to be. On top of that, if he couldn’t end it in an instant he was sure that the Dalki spread around the ship would come towards their location, which was why he had desired to create a large distraction.

Through the hallway that would lead to the command centre, Quinn had appeared along with Iree. The two of them stood there and teased the two guards by the door in order to lure them away. Of course seeing them, the guards straight away ran towards where Quinn and Iree were. However, what they didn’t know was just how fast Quinn was. Picking up Iree, and grabbing her like she was on her wedding day, he ran straight past the two of them.

The next second, he jumped in the air, and using his Qi to reinforce his leg, he struck at the ceiling as hard as he could. With a single strike part of the wall crumbled but not all, so he kicked it again, and as he was falling to the ground threw a blood swipe for measure , causing the top part to collapse in on itself.

Landing back down, Quinn safely put Iree back on the floor gently, and he could see her face was a little red.

"Sorry, did you get hurt?" Quinn asked.

"No, no, I-I... this was the first time I was held like that. And so easily..."

’That should hold them off for a little bit, but more will come.’ Quinn thought, as he quickly took Iree and the two of them went into the command centre using his shadow travel. Quinn carried on moving as he could see the Dalki inside were on high alert.

Going past all of the others until he had reached the one spiked Dalki, on the left. Popping out, he kicked both of the Dalki’s legs from the bottom, causing it to tumble as it fell to the ground, Quinn then performed a Blood hammer strike bashing it, and throwing it straight at the four spiked Dalki.

Seeing its fellow teammate coming towards him, the four spiked Dalki grabbed him by his head and legs. The next second he started to pull using his incredible strength ripping the Dalki apart, its green blood and insides falling to the ground.

"Useless!"

’That’s some strength they have.’

"Iree, use my mask to contact Logan! Describe everything you can see to him and let’s just hope he’ll have a way for us to take this thing down." He instructed as he threw it towards her, but there was still one Dalki in the room that needed to be dealt with before she could reach the controls or get to the command centre.

"Alright, four spikes, you think you’re so strong, we’ll see about that! I’m sorry, but I’ll have to finish you off quickly!" Quinn shouted, briefly closing his eyes he emptied the Qi inside his body. Instead a red aura filled his centre life force energy, making his body change into another form.

*****

# Chapter 1207 Scarier than a Dalki
Currently, Iree was trying her best to approach the control panel. However, a large obstacle stood in her way in the form of a two spiked Dalki. Her blood spear was drawn and her hands gripped around it tightly, while the small cut she had made on the palm of her hand continued to supply it with great power.

'I might have stood a chance against a one spike Dalki on my own, but a two spiked one might be out of my league, even with this awesome spear's power.'

However, there was one thing for sure, she couldn't afford to turn her back on an enemy like this. Iree was carefully watching the Dalki's movements. It was smiling and creeping towards her. It used its large tongue to lick around its mouth, taking pleasure in the fear it was creating.

The mask that had been handed to Iree started to vibrate. Receiving an incoming call again. She couldn't answer, for one slip in concentration, and it could be the end for her, and that's exactly what the Dalki had been waiting for, leaping forward.

Expecting such an attack, Iree thrust her spear right at the Dalki, piercing through its hand. The second the blade came into contact with the green blood, it started to grow stronger with power and slid in further, but even then, the Dalki upheld its creepy smile, not caring for its hand.

Shortening the distance, the Dalki was now within reach of Iree. Its fist came down aiming right at her head. If she tried to yank out the spear, she would be hit, but letting go of it would mean she would lose the only weapon that could realistically do anything against her foe.

'If that hits me, then I'm dead!' Iree realised as she could see her life flashing before her eyes.

However, just before the fist connected, a flicker of Shadow appeared between the two, blocking the hit. The Dalki was just as surprised as the young woman was, but she was the first to recover from their stupor. Using this to her advantage, she pulled the spear out with all her might and started to retreat back towards the console of controls.

'That shadow, it had to be Quinn, right?'

She and the Dalki were wondering where the Shadow had come from. looking around the room, they could see a young human male was in the middle of transforming.

'What….is that?' Iree thought. 'He…looks…like a monster! Is that… a real V?!'

Quinn had yet to turn fully into the Bloodsucker. In the middle of his transformation, he had seen Iree in trouble. When she had decided to come along with him, he had also used the Shadow On skill on her.

Initially, Quinn had wanted to preserve as many MC cells as he could, but after seeing the number of spikes the Dalki had, he had changed plans. There was no longer any need. While in his Bloodsucker form, he would be unable to use his Shadow or blood skills anyway, so the least he could do was help Iree out as much as possible.

However, now the transformation was complete. His hair had fallen to the ground, his muscles were bulging, showing next to no fat on his skin, and his fangs were sharpened. In the Bloodsucker form, he nearly reached the height of his Dalki opponent.

Instantly, Quinn dashed forward at speed quicker than he did so before and went right up to the Dalki's side. Soon he swung out his leg, his thigh and calf veins bulging to support the great strength.

'All my base stats are doubled, but I can't afford to take a single hit from that four spiked Dalki. I'm not as fast as with the armour's active skill, but I can't just pick away at this one.'

'If I hurt the Dalki, it will only allow it to get stronger and stronger as time goes on. I need to finish this fight as soon as possible, preferably instantly. I've practised the thigh kicks time and time again, but I haven't performed it once since I was in this Bloodsucker form, so let's just see how much damage this can do!'

The Dalki, instead of trying to dodge the attack, which he wasn't even sure he could do, decided to throw out a punch of his own, aiming for Quinn's head. The Dalki could tell that this opponent's form was strong, but as a four spiked Dalki he had next to no fear. Having recently evolved into a four spike, he felt almost invisible against anyone but his leaders.

"I will kill you!" The Dalki shouted, throwing its fist out harder and nearly just as fast, but due to Quinn's speed, his attack was able to hit first.

The second it had made an impact, a sound was heard In the Dalki's body. Something it had never experienced before, making his eyes open wide. His fist was slightly off target, falling to the side, skimming past Quinn's face.

At the same time, the Dalki's bone had pierced through his thigh skin, drawing an immense amount of blood.

'I can't fall! Not like this!' The Dalki pushed through the pain. The new rise in energy was making him practically feel nothing anyway, and he could see the Bloodsucker's fist coming at him. The Dalki grabbed the hand by the wrist.

'Shit, I never thought he could remain standing! Two hits should have been enough to finish it, but a four spike can already contest me in a battle of strength?!' Quinn thought as he saw the Dalki fist about to hit his face.

Quickly, Quinn had grabbed the other hand, and now the two of them were holding each other's hands up by their heads, pushing and pulling. Quinn still had his legs, but the distance between the two of them was too great. If he tried to reach with his kick, there was a chance the Dalki could overpower him even in this form.

"Maybe you never fought against a four spiked Dalki before, but a wound like this will soon heal, but I still get the energy boost from the fight. This is how the Dalki gets stronger. Their bodies break down from the fighting and heal, making them even stronger than before. Maybe fighting you will allow me to become a five spike!"

Now thinking about it, it was the same with Borden. At first, he could only summon a few spikes, but the number of spikes on his back would grow through fights and accumulated injuries.

'Doesn't this mean that they can keep getting stronger?' Quinn thought.

Trying to think of the best course of action, Quinn wondered if he should transform back and try to defeat him using other methods. It was then that another message had come up from the system screen.

[2/10 Planets have been taken over by the Dalki]

Seeing this, Quinn didn't have time to mess up. Using all his strength, he pulled the Dalki forward, and with his sharp teeth, he opened his mouth wide, biting down into the neck of his enemy. The green blood soon went through Quinn's body, empowering him more than he had ever experienced before

[4 spiked Dalki blood has been consumed]

[40% power boost has been temporarily applied]

With this, Quinn could easily hold the four spiked Dalki with his arms, then let go. He placed his far leg back and swung it once again with all his strength of a Bloodsucker and power boost. The second the kick connected with the Dalki's head, it flew off from its body and slammed right into the console, destroying one of the control terminals.

The two spiked Dalki, was still engaged in combat with Iree, but when it saw the head of its leader on the console, it froze for a second. Iree, who had been doing her best to survive until this moment, decided to use this moment.

"We are going to win this war!" She shouted, thrusting the blood blade right through Dalki's chest, piercing its heart.

'I Did it, I managed to kill a two spiked Dalki.' She thought to herself, but when looking up, she could see its head had been removed from its body as well. Now Iree was left seeing the most frightening figure she had ever seen. Something that she could have only dreamt up in her worst nightmares.

Quinn, still in the Bloodsucker form, had green blood spatters around his face. His mouth was open wide, baring his fangs.

She took a step back, almost stumbling to the floor.

'This…..'

Soon, his body started to revert back to its original size, his hair started to grow back to what it once was.

"Did you manage to contact Logan?" Was Quinn's words as the transformation had ended.

It took a while for Iree to answer because she was having a hard time grasping what had just happened, and she had expected for Quinn to lunge at her at any moment next.

"Um…no, but I think I might have missed a call from them."

It was then that Iree had gotten an update from Yag and the others about some interesting things. It looked like they didn't need to call Logan after all. Besides, even after they had tried, he was unable to answer on his end.

Quinn quickly headed to the engine room, where the Dalki that were guarding were soon dealt with. The engines were easily destroyed by Quinn and the ship started to fall to the ground right on course to hit the other Dalki.

It was at that moment that Quinn had received another notification from the system.

[1/10 Dalki Motherships destroyed]

"Quinn, before we get off this ship, we should head to a place not too far away from you. I'm sure we can use them somehow!" Yag said.

As the group headed over, Quinn wondered if he could defeat ten ships in time because he was currently lagging behind. They were moving fast through the ship as they knew they didn't have much time until it would crash into the ground.

During that time, Quinn's masks started to vibrate once more.

'Is Logan getting back to me, or maybe Sam tried to call me again.' Quinn thought. He had tried to call them back, but there were no answers either. At least he could tell Sam was still alive.

"Quinn! It's Alex. It's done! Your Demon tier item is ready!!"

*****

# Chapter 1208 One Down
After destroying the mothership's engines, the ship was slowly starting to fall from the sky. It appeared to have some type of backup system that prevented it from just crashing down, instead it floated down towards the ground. It was a shame because Quinn had been hoping that by bringing it down, they might be able to crush the Dalki camp underneath them.

'This ship will fall and crash, I'm sure since the system even said that the quest was complete, but if there is an easier way to destroy these ships, it would help out with the Quest.' Quinn also needed to make sure there was no way possible for them to easily get the thing back up and running as well.

Eventually, Yag had led Quinn and the others to a strange factory room, where the crystals were being processed even now. They had exited from the Shadow space and were busy turning their heads looking around.

"Why did you bring us to this place, and what is it?" Iree asked.

Although they were curious about the place, the others still were worrying about the fact that the ship was currently falling out of the sky at the moment. The only reason why Iree wasn't panicking was because she believed that Quinn could save them. As long as he was in his current form that is.

While looking around, the two of them had made eye contact, and a flash of Quinn's other self had appeared in her mind. It was so frightening she could feel her back starting to sweat, so the young woman quickly looked away, avoiding further eye contact.

Quinn was her saviour, but ever since she had seen him turn, the mental image was stuck in her head. Iree had even made sure her hands were wrapped, so the smell of blood wouldn't leak out and agitate him.

She didn't know that doing that was completely useless, because Quinn could smell it even then, not to mention he had already had his fill of Dalki blood, satisfying him. Should he feel a bit peckish he could always just take another sip from the flask where he had stored some of it, since it should be of help on the other planets.

"This one seems to be a factory for crystal processing." Yag tried to explain. "There are several conveyor belts that go to different places as well. One of them should be the engine room that you guys just destroyed, as for the other two we didn't really have time to check them out, but this was what we wanted to show you."

Opening two large heavy steel doors, Yag and Anna struggled to push them open, until Quinn stepped forward and used a single hand to offer them some help. The doors swung open, allowing them entry to another room, still linked to the factory.

There was a slight glow coming from the large metal containers, and non processed crystals could be seen in them. Quinn wasted no time jumping on top of them to get a closer look.

'Crystals! This whole container is filled with different grade beast crystals! Just one container seems to have as many beast crystals as the Demi-god tier beast had kept, and there are twenty containers in this room alone!' From his elevated position he could see that nearly all of them were filled up to the very top. There was only one that had been emptied, while another appeared to be in use, probably fueling the emergency system.

Moving along, Quinn quickly followed the other convey belts, learning that these crystals were being used to power certain things on the ship, not just the engines. The amount of crystals was beyond even what the Bertha ships the military had used.

The next room had a pillar in the centre, and on the top half a sphere, above which was something slightly resembling the ship. Around the room there were several glass containers filled with crystals like a dispensing candy machine.

Once one crystal was used up, the factory would quickly exchange it for another crystal, powering it all.

'This technology is far too advanced to originate from the Dalki.' Vincent could tell at a glance. 'Most of them only care about fighting and getting stronger. It almost seems impossible that any of them would have the patience to put that much time and effort into not only studying but also inventing something like this.'

'So you think all of this is Jim's doing? After all, we know that he's been helping them from the beginning.' Quinn questioned.

'It would make sense. Jim has always been clever, and with no restrictions holding him back, I wouldn't be surprised if he managed to create things that we have never seen before. If only he was on our side… Quinn, we have to stop him, no matter what!'

Quinn agreed, and soon found himself walking up to the pillar and placing his hand on it. There was no reaction from him, and at a time like this he wished Logan was here.

'Wait a minute?'

Thinking about this, Quinn remembered that his system in a way did work like Logan, at least the Inspect skill did. At certain times using it when touching certain electronics or items would give him certain details.

[Inspect]

[Dalki defense system]

[Shield at 100 percent]

[Energy at 100 percent]

'So this is the reason why none of the attacks got through to the motherships? They are able to utilise this many crystals?'

A shield created from beast crystals was something that human ships could do as well, but the conversion rate was less than ideal, and that was being polite. The energy inside the crystals would be used up far too fast similar to how Logan used crystals with his energy blades.

'I guess if the Dalki have no other use for the crystals like we do they can use it for this purpose.' Quinn thought.

'Jim could have also invented a more efficient way for energy to be used as well.' Vincent added.

Regardless, Quinn wasn't the type of person who would be able to figure something like this out. Since it was a device located on the inside, it would be nearly impossible for anybody to destroy a Dalki mothership from the outside. Humanity simply didn't have the crystals necessary to constantly fire their lasers to compete with the Dalki reserves, especially since the latter had the better technology.

Because of this, Quinn decided that it was best to leave the place as it was. Hoping that they could use it in some way later on. Before leaving though, Quinn went back to the previous room, and withdrew all the crystals from the containers placing them in his dimensional space.

'The Dalki own half of the beast planets and have been collecting crystals for far longer than us. Only they never bothered to turn them into weapons or armour. Just with the loot of one mothership, it will help alleviate the crystal problem by a lot.'

Following the conveyor belt to one more place, Quinn had entered another room which he didn't recognise. He had assumed that since the Dalki had been created by the vampires they would have more similarities, but some of this stuff looked modern even for the current time period. There were several long stick objects, but it was clearly an invention, or machinery of some kind. Each with a large crystal on top of each of them.

Placing his hand on the device he did the same again.

[Inspect]

[Planet Jamming Array]

'So this is what causes the teleporters to stop working? At least now I know what they look like, so if it happens again we can look for it. Not every time the teleporters have been jammed has there been a mother ship along with it, so I guess they must have a mobile version of these things as well.'

For this one, Quinn was unable to leave it be, because he needed the teleporters to work. First he took out the crystals from the device, each one of them at the Emperor tier level. It looked like this device too needed a lot of energy to sustain it, which made it valuable loot.

Next he grabbed one of the strange devices and placed this in his dimensional space as well, before destroying the others.

After taking every crystal they had, Quinn was soon off form the ship. He took the others with him and with the shadow was able to create a safe landing. It looked like the Dalki who were on the ground were now unorganised and had split up in different directions, but all of them should be heading to a certain place, the Shelter!

———

*BANG*

The whole ground shook violently. It felt like a giant earthquake, as items fell from shelves, just as the people who had just been standing. The good thing was that the mothership had fallen slowly so it didn't create too much of a problem, but still with its giant weight and how far it was they could feel the impact.

"He did it, he took down the Dalki mothership!" Peach screamed with excitement, witnessing what would later be recorded as the turning point in the Second Dalki War.

"Who is He? And did they really take out a Dalki mothership? How could that happen?"

"Who else could it be but Quinn, the only man deserving to be my husband?!" Helen questioned with a smile. "Maybe, he's grown so much, becoming such a big deal that he might be a bit too much for me."

———

This news wasn't just a good reason for the Cursed faction to celebrate though, because the news had also spread to the Earthborn faction and the Graylash faction as well.

"That kid… I guess I can't call him a kid anymore, after he was able to achieve something great before us again." Owen muttered to himself with a smile

"This will be another morale boost that we can all use. It proves that the Dalki aren't invincible." Sach spoke, but both of these world leaders still had their own problems to face. Yet, they were thinking the same thing.

'I have to catch up to him.'

———

The news had also managed to spread to the Dalki themselves. In particular Graham who was just walking out of another destroyed faction base. Blood splattered across his face.

'They actually managed to take down one of our motherships? I never expected them to be able to do that, much less in such a short amount of time…'

"Tell me exactly where the ship was taken down!" Graham ordered, be surprised that it was in their region.

———

Travelling back through the shadow Quinn and the others had returned to the Shelter. The celebrating news didn't last long because Helen was preparing for battle. The Dalki soldiers that were on the ground were already coming over.

Quinn quickly spat out the others from his shadow, and soon went to see Helen on top of the north wall.

"Helen, I need to ask you, are the teleporters on this planet working?" Quinn asked.

"They are working, but only on our planet. We're still unable to move to any of the other planets, because it's not working on their end." Helen clarified the situation for him. Still it was good enough all things considered.

"Helen, I did what I could for this place, but I have to move on. I trust you and your sisters to be able to deal with those from the Dalki camp. With the portals active again, prioritise the lives of the people over the Shelter, if necessary."

"I need to go to protect the rest of the Cursed planets!" Quinn said, as his body started to sink into the shadows.

"Wait Quinn, where are you going?" Helen asked.

"To get something that will help us win this fight!" Quinn answered before his head finally disappeared.

# Chapter 1209 The Amulett
Forging was a process that required immense amounts of concentration. It was akin to a science as the timing and the location of their hammer strikes, the hotness of the flame and various other things all had to be taken into account by an experienced crafter. It was even harder when they had to be working with new materials they didn't have any prior experience with. In the end, a lot of it came to the forger's intuition and skill.

The forging room was almost devoid of people, except for two. Andrew, the person who had crafted Oscar's personal weapon, making him the only known crafter to have ever created a Demon tier weapon, and the Cursed faction's master forger, Alex.

The duo were preparing different things to complete the process of creating the Demon tier item. The only thing was, although they were aware that time was limited given their situation, they couldn't afford to rush things either. A single wrong step and all could be for naught, since they lacked the materials to do it over again.

Every so often the room was shaking violently. Each time this happened, Alex would stop hammering for a few seconds. As soon as the vibrations subsided, he would continue in his forging.

"Damn those Dalki, couldn't they have picked another day?!" Alex let out his frustration. If it wasn't for the enemy attacks the two of them might have already completed their job.

Meanwhile, Andrew was finishing up the molding process on what looked like a large metal slab. Even though he had giant muscular biceps and rough fingers, they were capable of doing small delicate work.

"When I went out, the situation wasn't looking good." Andrew's sweat was dripping down his face, slowly finishing the final details. "The Dalki have already breached the Shelter."

Hearing this, there was no time for talking, and the final steps had to be finished. Alex came over pouring a brightly shining liquid into the moulding that Andrew had created. While it was cooling down, the two forgers would have to carefully apply hammer strikes where it was needed.

——

Just as Andrew had said, ten Dalki had already made their way into the Shelter and were currently in the midst of causing a rampage. Buildings got destroyed, panicked civilians were running around, trying to escape somewhere safe.

Those who were stationed on the wall and the Mechs were busy firing at the Dalki that were moving towards them. They had no choice but to ignore the screams behind them, otherwise more of the Dalki would soon get inside the Shelter.

To help make sure that no more Dalki would make it inside, was none other than Linda. She had used her transformation ability to enlarge herself to the limit, and was using her large beast weapon and great strength to hit away the invaders.

'I can only protect the north gate, and these Dalki have great strength themselves. At most I could deal with a couple on my own. With support from the faction I can hold them off, but it's only a matter of time before more get inside.' Linda was worried, aware that without some miracle her actions would ultimately be futile.

Ko, the leader of the faction, had come to the same conclusion and was hoping that the Graylash faction, as they were the closest ones, might help them out. Alas, nobody appeared to be coming to reinforce them, all equally busy protecting their own bases.

"What shall we do?" Ely asked the vice leader. "I don't think they're going to send anyone. It might have been a different story if General Robin would have still been in charge, but we can't change that now, so what are we meant to do?"

"Hold and wait! It's the only thing we can do. Honestly we are lucky that we have been able to last this long thanks to the two of them." Ko said, as he watched Wevil sprinting around the Shelter, doing his best to help out.

He had just finished dealing with one of the Dalki inside, causing their numbers to fall to nine. However, he did so coming out with a broken arm, his transformation had come to an end, as he had used too much energy.

'I've gotten stronger! Can't wait to tell Nate that I managed to take on a single spiked Dalki all on my own!' Wevil thought to himself. Despite his proud accomplishment, he was also aware that given their current situation this wasn't enough.

While searching for a willing human he could use a Blood bank to heal his injuries, he felt a strange energy originate from behind him. Everyone else could also feel a slight shiver in their spine. Even the Dalki stopped in their tracks for a second to turn and look into the direction the energy came from, the main base.

'Isn't that where Alex is busy working, what is going on?'

The nine Dalki that had been terrorising the place, all started to head towards the main shelter building in unison.

"No, Alex! He isn't a fighter!" Wevil shouted. He started to run forward but at that moment, one of the other gates had been breached and another Dalki had entered. Immediately, it went to swipe and grab one of the women closest.

The Dalki had grabbed nothing but air, as Wevil now held onto the girl.

"I saved you, so I'm going to need a little something from you. I hope Linda isn't looking."

——

In the forging room, the Demon tier item had just received its finishing touch and was now pulsing with energy. Although the initial glow started to dim down, it did nothing to hide the prowess hidden inside the item.

"Quinn! It's Alex. It's done! Your Demon tier item is ready!!"

After delivering the message, Alex had somewhat expected for Quinn to come out of his shadow straight away, but for some reason the Cursed faction leader hadn't done so. Instead, the ones who had arrived were several Dalki.

The first thing Andrew did after seeing them barge through the doorway, was grab a large forging hammer. His hand started to glow and he ended up throwing it directly at them. It flew straighter than a hammer should have done and when it hit the foremost Dalki's torso, it sent it alongside the two behind it flying backwards.

"Take the item, we must protect it!" Andrew shouted.

Quickly, Alex picked up the small item. It was a round object that would fit into the palm of one's hand. The forger tied the necklace piece, a small black chain, through the loop at the end. The Demon tier amulet now could be worn around one's neck like a necklace, which he promptly did.

'I'm sorry Quinn, I know this is your item, but I'll need to take it out for a test drive first.' Alex thought but something strange occured... or more accurately nothing did. Despite wearing it the beast gear item didn't activate. Alex didn't feel the least bit of power course through his body as it should have!

'"Crap!" Alex cursed as one of the Dalki who had recognised that the necklace was what had led them here, ignoring Andrew, it threw a fist towards Alex. His red wings came to life, and allowed him to fly up quickly to the ceiling avoiding the blow.

'Why? Why doesn't this thing give me any extra strength, speed or ANYTHING? Was there something wrong in the process? No, even if we made a mistake, it shouldn't have wasted it to the degree that it's completely useless!' Although Alex had been sure about his techniques and even Andrew hadn't found any faults in it, it didn't change the fact that the necklace was acting like a dud.

Worst of all, he could see another one of the Dalki approach Andrew. He was strong for a forger, but he was not a top class Traveler. Seeing this, Alex threw out his special blood fairy swipes, but when it hit the Dalki, it did next to no damage.

At the same time, he himself wasn't out of danger just because he was a couple feet above the ground. This was a forgery and it was filled with weapons, the Dalki were picking up anything they could find and were hurtling the sharp objects towards him.

One of the things Alex loved to do in his spare time other than making weapons was practice his flying skills. He moved through the air avoiding almost all the items. Among the Dalki though there were two spiked ones. One of them used its great strength to hurl an axe twice as fast as the others.

The weapon pierced right through one of his red blood wings. An electric shock ran through his whole body and it felt as if someone had pulled out his teeth without any anesthesia, causing him to fall and crash head first into the ground. The pain he had felt now multiplied, but the adrenaline was keeping it down. He was also worried about someone else. Lifting his head he could see Andrew's shoulder had been pierced by a Dalki.

A forger's life was over if they could no longer use their arms, but by the looks of it, Andrew would have little time to lament this. Fluttering his uninjured wing, Alex managed to dash forward slightly and was now close to Andrew. He raised his shadow blocking the other attacks. With so many Dalki surrounding them, his MC cells were depleted after just three attacks, and now they were coming towards him.

Alex felt his body being hit away, by a large great force tumbling to the ground, and instead of him suffering from the attacks from the attacks, they had hit Andrew instead. Andrew didn't look away from Alex on the ground, and blood filled his mouth.

"You have the talent to take beast gear to the next level. Live, run and make sure that Demon tier weapon ends up in the right hands!" Andrew said, his mouth dripping blood.

Alex wanted to fight back, he wanted to do something but he knew it was all useless and if he stayed here Andrew's sacrifice would end up vain.

He grabbed his flask that was filled with vampire blood, in particular it was Quinn's blood. A great energy rose in him, making him stronger than he had felt before. His wing instantly healed from the prior wound.

Perhaps if he had consumed the blood beforehand they would have been able to last a little longer, but winning still wasn't an option. With a face full of tears, Alex regrettably fled from the scene, by flying his way out of the forging room and into the halls. There he quickly found a cracked wall that the Dalki had created to get to him.

Once out, he landed on the ground and looked around him. The situation in the Shelter was far more disastrous than he had anticipated. The Dalki had managed to break through one of the gates that Linda was unable to protect. Wevil was busy fighting, along with the other faction members.

"Why don't you work!" Alex shouted, grabbing the amulet around his neck. Moments later the nine or so Dalki that was in the forging room with him had come out as well.

"I'm sorry if I had known your situation was this bad, I would have been here sooner. Let me deal with the rest." A voice sounded directly behind him. Alex had been so lost in his thoughts that he hadn't even noticed that Quinn had appeared from his own shadow.

"Quinn, kill them! Kill them all!" Alex screamed in anger, as he lifted the amulet off his head, and handed it over to Quinn.

******

# Chapter 1210 The Amulet Part 2
The second Quinn touched the amulet he could feel that it wasn't like any of the other beast gear he had received before. The others were just pieces of equipment until the user tried to activate them, but the amulet itself was already giving off a strong energy, as if it was alive.

Whenever Alex would mix his blood into making beast gear it would usually dye the equipment red, although when using higher tier crystals like the Demi-god tier ones their original coloration would stay. However, for this Demon tier crystal, Alex didn't use his blood, since it wasn't to be forged into a weapon and Alex was worried about the outcome if he did try to do so.

It had a strange design for the amulet with its colour being half black and half white. Together they resembled the shape of the upside down marking that the Demon tier tree had given out to the Marked.

Unfortunately, Quinn didn't have much time to use his Inspect skill to figure out what it could do, as he needed to deal with the situation inside the Shelter first.

'After everything I did to protect this place from the Demon tier tree, now the Dalki are rampaging all over…' Quinn lamented the situation. As a Vampire Lord his nose was filled with the heavy smell of blood that spoke volumes about their own death toll.

'At least there are enough of you for me to do this.'

[Soul Weapon 'Item type' activated]

A great pain ran through Quinn's body as the energy from inside him got unleashed. The blades from his item started to pierce through the skin in his arms, running up and down them, drawing out his blood.

Swinging out, both of the bladed chains closed the distance to the Dalki in front of him, its severed head flying through the air. Not even a second later the now lifeless heads of its companions joined in.

'The Dalki that everyone was struggling with… Quinn's managing to defeat them all so easily… It doesn't look like I'll have to worry about him, and he seems to have figured something regarding the Demon tier Amulet.' Alex thought and with that he ran back to the forging room.

He had to check how Andrew was doing. He hadn't known the other forger for too long, but it was the first time that Alex had ever had something like a teacher who showed him the ropes and genuinely praised his talents. He had accepted an invite from a nobody forger like himself, and because he had stayed to help him finish crafting the amulet, he had sacrificed his own life.

Making his way through all the halls, he eventually reaches the forger room, only to find Andrew lying there on the floor with a pool of blood underneath him. Rushing to his side he could see he had been punctured several times, his guts partly spilling from his stomach, but his eyes still had a bit of life in them.

"You've… come back? How... long has... it been?" Andrew spoke softly, each word costing him a bit of his limited remaining lifespan. Once the Blood fairy had fled the other Dalki had quickly followed after the source of the immense power they had felt coming from the amulet, but not before making sure that Andrew would pay for getting in their way.

"This is all my fault!" Alex sobbed, as he looked into Andrew's eyes. He grabbed a small blade that had fallen to the floor. "You still want to live, right? You can't just die yet! Not before you've seen what we've managed to craft! I promise I'll let you live! I've seen Quinn do this a few times, and the others told me what needed to be done!"

Making a cut, Alex started to draw a strong symbol underneath the forger, who lacked the energy to accept or refuse what the other was doing. It wasn't the same way Quinn would do it, but back in Vampire World, Alex had seen others do this a few times. Finally when the special symbol was drawn underneath Andrew's body the Blood fairy squeezed his hand, dropping several drops of his blood into the forger's mouth.

"Please, come back!" Alex shouted at Andrew.

The wounds didn't start to heal, making the forger question if he had made a mistake. But soon enough Andrew's body began to toss and he let out a blood chilling scream. More followed at a volume that even those on the walls could hear them.

"I'm sorry. We all had to endure this, so I know how much it hurts, but I promise once you get through this, you'll be back to your pride!" Alex held on to Andrew's hand, hoping it would take at least some pain away.

Unsure if the words had gotten through or not, he continued to stay by Andrew's side until the other shot up, his eyes a glowing red and the next second something sprouted out from his back.

Two large red blood-like wings even bigger than Alex's.

———

When Quinn had put the amulet around his neck, the first thing he did while fighting against the Dalki was try to activate it. However, he didn't feel anything change, like would be usually the case when he benefited from additional stats.

After seeing how much the Demi-god tier equipment improved his other stats, he had been looking forward to his first true piece of Demon tier equipment, but its performance so far was underwhelming. He hoped his Inspect skill would give him the information he would need like it did for the other items, but first Quinn needed to deal with all the troublesome Dalki who had made it into the Shelter.

Fighting against the Dalki with his Soul Weapon they were no match for him. Soon the strain form using his soul weapon was felt on his body, and he had placed it away.

'I already dealt with over half of them in the Shelter, now to deal with the ones at the gate!' Quinn ran off in the direction of the gates where the Dalki were seen coming in. At one gate there were around twenty of them, and jumping through the gate, Quinn grabbed the head of the first Dalki and slammed it to the ground.

[Weapon active skill activated]

Using the silver coloured gauntlet he started to drain the energy from the Dalki. The power he had lost and the effect of using his soul weapon were fading away. Another came close to Quinn. He fired out a Blood shotgun with the palm of his hand.

A concentrated version of the blood spray. The blood attack didn't spread out as much and the damage was more concentrated in one place. The Dalki was seen being thrown back, and at the same time Quinn had received another message.

[The opponent has been poisoned]

'What? It can actually poison them without me having to directly hit them? It still works if I use my blood skills? Is it because the blood attacks go through my gauntlets? I guess things like a Crescent kick wouldn't have the same effect.'

The gauntlets were starting to get better as Quinn used them more and more. It also showed the importance of equipment.

After regaining his energy, Quinn was fighting once more. He chose to fight with his Qi more than his blood abilities. Thanks to the gauntlet he could regain the energy that he had lost. His blood powers he would use them sparingly.

After clearing out all the gates, the Dalki inside were also dealt with. During the fight though, Quinn had noticed something. Meeting up with Linda at the north gate, there was one Dalki left, and before it could do anything Quinn slammed his Blood drill through its head.

'It was a two spiked Dalki, if I use my Qi too much I start to lose control of the balance in my body as well. I need to find a way to increase the power of my blood as soon as possible.'

Then, what had been happening ever since Quinn had obtained the Demon tier item had happened once again. From the dead body, strange glowing small little particles lifted, and came straight towards Quinn.

They weren't heading towards him though, instead they had entered the inside of the amulet, and a notification screen had appeared.

[The Demon tier Amulet has now consumed enough energy for use]

[0/1 Slots are now available]

[Continue to supply the Demon tier Amulet with energy in order to unlock more slots]

With no context whatsoever, Quinn had no clue what the Demon tier item could exactly do. Now that the fighting inside the Shelter had settled down, he could finally take a look.

It took a while for Quinn to read all the information that the Demon tier Amulet provided and when he finally had figured it out, a large grin appeared on his face.

'With this, I might actually be able to complete this Quest!!!'

# Chapter 1211 Demon tier powers
[Demon tier Amulet: Branching Link]

[The Branching Link Amulet absorbs a part of energy from anything the User kills. Once the amulet has gathered enough energy it will unlock a slot. With each slot the amount of energy required to unlock a new one increases]

The information itself was split into different segments and this was merely the first one. Only after having killed a certain amount of Dalki did the energy requirement pass its threshold, unlocking the first slot, which was also the reason why neither Alex nor Quinn had received any sort of benefit from wearing it initially. The good news was that it sounded like it would work with anything that he killed, be it beasts, vampires, Dalki or other living things.

'As long as I keep killing Dalki, doesn't that mean I can technically have an unlimited amount?'

Quinn wondered. However, the system was vague, only claiming that it would require more and more energy for each additional slot, making him worry that at some point it could have the same issue as his exp bar.

[Once a slot has been unlocked the User is able to use it to mark any living creature.

Success chance will depend on the life-force and willpower of the living creature it is used on.

No matter the outcome, the slot will be used up.

Each successful Marking will also take up one slot.]

Given the description it appeared that Marking higher tier beasts, stronger people or the Dalki leader would most likely be hard to impossible. Quinn would have to choose between using the slots to attempt it, after all succeeding in marking someone like One Horn might very well change the tide of war, or use the slots on weaker Dalki, creating something like an elite guard.

[Those that are Marked can be either partially or fully controlled by the user.

Energy can be shared between User and Marked based on the User's discretion.

It's possible to strengthen a Marked via the User's energy.

It's possible to suck a Marked completely dry, thereby adding its strength temporarily to the User.

The only way for the Marking to disappear is upon the death of a Marked, death of the User or destruction of the Branching Ling Amulet]

This was the power of the Demon tier Amulet. Quinn wasn't too surprised that it turned out to have some brainwashing capabilities since the Demon tier tree had used its powers to enslave others. Still, there were differences to the original.

'I'm not able to control just anything. It seems like there is only a chance to control something and the amount of things I can control is vastly different. The energy as well given to the Marked comes from myself. I'm guessing they need to be alive to attempt to put a marking on them. Breaking a strong beast's will, or a human's will would be incredibly difficult to attempt at the moment.'

'Then there's the last catch. I thought it was strange that the Demon tier Amulet didn't give any stats, but that's because I can also take the energy from those that I have marked. I wonder if it's the same as Qi energy, or perhaps it will directly boost my stats depending on what I control. It's a temporary boost for me, but permanently affects the marked. Which means it's best if I don't use it on my own people.' Quinn concluded.

However, after reading everything, Quinn had come up with an idea just how he could use the amulet to help him take down the Dalki ships even quicker, but before that, he needed to run some tests.

Quinn wanted to check up on Alex, yet the Blood fairy had run off inside. But decided not to, since time was running out and could tell he was in no such danger due to the bond. After seeing to Wevil and Linda. He made sure that the two of them could look over him while Quinn had gone out on his own.

"Wait, Quinn what are you planning on doing?" Linda asked, before Quinn rushed off.

"The teleporters aren't working on this planet. So nobody can come to help or escape from this place. At the same time I need to get back to the Cursed faction planets and help them. There's a device on the motherships that jams the teleporters." Saying these things, Quinn was off out into the open field.

"Wait…is he planning on entering the mothership?" Linda realised.

"Not just enter." Ko said, who was standing by her side watching Quinn enter his shadow. "He intends to bring it down. I just got news that the Cursed faction managed to destroy one of those things!"

Although Quinn was able to destroy the mothership, it took far too much time. First, he had to find the Dalki camp on the planet so he could steal one of their ships, else he would just be shot down, before even coming close to his target. Even after he had successfully infiltrated them, he would have to face the crew of it and find the right rooms.

So he needed to find a quicker way. Soon he had come across another group of Dalki scouts amid the strange tailing trees and large colourful plants.

Wasting no time, Quinn began to take them all out fighting them. The amulet absorbed the energy as each of the Dalki was killed, until there was only one left. Soon, getting up behind the Dalki, Quinn attempted to use the power of the amulet on the Dalki.

He pressed it on its back and activated the energy. It started to light up for a few seconds, but the power soon disappeared.

[Marking has failed]

The Dalki swung its arm behind it, and now with Quinn's single slot gone, he had no use for the Dalki anymore. Using the blood drill was the quickest and easiest way to pierce through the Dalki's hard exterior and had the highest chance of killing it in one shot, and it hadn't failed him today, as he slammed it into the Dalki's chest.

'The move is so effective against Dalki's that Eno might have created it with the specific purpose in mind to counter them.' Quinn thought but he was realising the power of the amulet was harder to use then he first thought. 'If I want to mark something I have no clue the percentage or success rate. At the same time, I want it to be in good condition. It's not like the shadow eater where I don't have to worry how weak the person I use it is on.'

Nonetheless, Quinn didn't quit there and continued to look for the Dalki hunting squads. After fighting another squad it looked like his amulet filled quickly. Ten dalki was enough to fill up the first slot.

Meeting a third squad, Quinn defeated another ten, but a second slot wasn't filled. Capturing the last of the Dalki though, Quinn was able to make a second attempt at capturing one and once again it failed.

From then, Quinn met a smaller squad, one of five. Killing only a few of them had allowed him to regain the first slot. It looked like even if a slot had disappeared, the energy carried over so he didn't have to start from the beginning again. The good thing as well, was even if it failed the first slot energy requirements seemed to stay the same.

There was a worry that he would have to continue fighting more and more as the slots continued. Managing to have only one Dalki left, if it didn't work a third time, Quinn was going to have to try it on a lesser beast instead.

After all, he still wasn't sure what controlling a beast would actually work or feel like, nor did he have any reference as to how hard it was to mark a one spiked Dalki. Placing the amulet on the Dalki's back once more, when it lit up and Quinn moved his hand away. The exact same design that was shown on the amulet stayed on the giant lizard's back.

It was the same red as the Marked had, but his was only the size of the amulet itself, making it much harder for anyone else to notice.

[You have successfully marked someone]

[1/1]

'Yes! Now, let's see what you can do.'

******

# Chapter 1212 Full control of a new body
It had taken a few tries, but finally the marking had succeeded, granting Quinn control over a Dalki of all things. As soon as the red mark had appeared on its back, it had stopped all its resistances. All of its aggression, its anger, everything seemed to have seeped out, reminding him of Peter when he had just been turned. However unlike his undead friend, the creature before him was still very much alive, standing straight and awaiting instructions.

'Great, so I don't have to worry about them going crazy wild like the Marked from the trees. Now to test out a few things.' Quinn thought.

The description had stated that the User of the Branching Link Amulet could do two major things to his Marked, Control and Energy Transfer. The former was split up between Partial Control and Full Control, whereas the latter allowed the User to either enhance the Marked by sending them his energy or strengthen himself by draining them, although at least the latter case was just a temporary boost.

'Let's try controlling it first.'

It was a strange feeling, when activating the Demon tier Amulet he could feel a connection to the Dalki in front of him, yet it was different to the one he shared with his family members. It felt more as if he had grown an extra limb that he could now control.

There were a few simple tests that Quinn had done, for one he tried to make the Dalki use his own martial arts which worked out surprisingly well. Its body was stronger and taller than the Vampire Lord so it took him a while to get used to.

Next Quinn tried to control the Dalki while also using his own body. Moving both bodies was easy enough, but when he tried to spar with it, that was when problems started to arise. The Cursed faction leader already had some experience in regards to splitting his attention to use his shadow powers, but mixing in the control over a Dalki made everything far more complicated than he had anticipated.

'It's only going to get more difficult the more Marked I'm going to add, so I need to get the hang of it.'

There had to be a solution to this problem, so instead of fine controlling the Dalki, a feat that a puppeteer like Fex might be better suited for, Quinn went into the forest to try and control it through basic commands. With his sharp nose it didn't take them long to find a suitable test dummy.

It was an Intermediate tier beast that looked like a boar, so it wouldn't be too hard for him or the Dalki to defeat it, yet the goal was still for Quinn to learn about the limits of the Demon tier Amulet. On the way here, he had already confirmed that a mental command to 'follow' him was sufficient for the Dalki to act. There was no need to control each individual movement like its leg.

Its brain still had some self function capabilities, however questioning it was not something that could be done, still this gave him an idea. Instead of outright ordering it to 'attack' the beast, Quinn informed the Marked that 'beast = enemy', curious to see how it would react. As soon as the Dalki's eyes landed on the boar, it rushed forward to finish it off, but just before he connected Quinn sent out another command 'beast = ally'.

The Dalki immediately stopped, short of the boar's forehead. The Intermediate beast, jumped backwards before it charged at the Dalki for daring to attack it. To Quinn's surprise the Marked just took the hits, without retaliating.

'So the Marked can differentiate friend from foe if I tell them to, they can follow at least simple commands and they fight like they usually do. Something more complicated like making it use my martial arts appears to require my own control. Hmmm, if I took the time to teach it to them, could it perhaps use it on its own? Perhaps I should make one join Nate's training in the future.' Quinn thought, but since they were at war and he had a Quest that was practically a race against time, he quickly proceeded to the next test, Full Control.

Activating the amulet again, Quinn instinctively knew what he needed to do, so he closed his eyes to tighten his senses.

'So this is Full Control, huh.' Quinn looked at his hands, yet they weren't pale like usual, instead they were large and covered in scales. Standing opposite him was a human that looked small, his eyes closed.

'This is far better than I thought, I can control the Dalki body completely like my own.' To familiarise himself with his new body he took a few practice kicks and swings and this time there was no delay and no awkward feeling like when he had used Partial Control.

However, he then wondered what about his own body, was it now just standing there like the Dalki did before it. Even though the Dalki did not have the amulet, Quinn could still feel the time and its uses the same way he could do before. He attempted the Partial Control and it worked. Quinn's body was moving him as it was directed.

Next Quinn wanted to test out the Energy Transfer to see how it felt. Even while his consciousness seemed to be fully inside the Dalki's body, he could tell that he was able to do this. Soon small amounts of energy entered the Dalki's body, its strength was growing at an amazing rate, but he could feel his original body was getting weaker.

'This is good. I could improve the one spiked Dalki to have a power of a two spike or three spike with my powers, which means my plan will work.'

Commiting to this test even more, so he himself went away from his original body, and tried to transfer energy once again, and still even at a distance the skill of the Demon tier had worked.

There was just one last thing Quinn wanted to test and that was the simple commands in his original body, while he was still in the Dalki body. The reason for this was Quinn's body was the one with the system, however while in the Dalki body he was unable to access any of the system information, like using the Inspect skill on the boar-like beast who was fleeing after realising the futility of its actions.

The next test started with Quinn sending his own body the command to protect itself at all costs. He wanted to see whether it would just use the Vampire Lord's natural strength or also utilise all the blood powers, shadows powers and beast gear he had access to without the need for Partial Control.

This was of the utmost importance since it would decide how safe Full Control actually was. Dalki Quinn walked up to his vampire body punching his fist out, only for it to get caught in Vampire Quinn's palm. Something he had seen bullies do to him a while ago and he felt like imitating.

'Being this tall sure is nice. No wonder the Dalki aren't scared of humans, we look so… small.'

From his position he used the Dalki body to do a thigh kick. The muscle structure was slightly different, but the power was supreme. Just before the kick would make contact though, Quinn's body jumped back and moved away.

'Do I have to make my body see the Marked body as an enemy for it to attack me? That would be hard to do, unless I could see what both of me are seeing at the same time, but I only have vision from what I am fully in control of. Let's just see if I can get it to attack me.' Quinn thought.

He charged in again, this time throwing out multiple punches which were blocked and parried away. Getting frustrated, Dalki Quinn stomped the ground lifting up pieces of the rubble, and started to punch them towards Vampire Quinn.

Next he ran behind, hoping to trap his original body and went to punch even faster. So far he had been a little cautious after all he didn't want to hurt his own body, but then a shadow had risen, stopping one of the blows from hitting him.

'I guess if it's life is really on the line it will use abilities as well, but it still hasn't attacked back!' Quinn quickly went to the ground and did a long sweep across the floor with his leg, that's when Quinn's body jumped up in the air, and landed on top of the Dalki head.

'I never realised how annoying and fast it could be to fight myself!' Dalki Quinn grabbed Vampire Quinn by the thighs, and tried to smash him into the ground, but just as his body was about to hit the ground, it twisted in flexible ways to break free. Jumping off the Dalki body, his original was free from injuries once again standing there.

"What the…how did you even do that?" Quinn questioned his body. While that was something he could do, after all, he had just himself doing it, it was nothing he would have ever attempted to do unless someone had told him to. Grappling techniques wasn't something he had really studied. It was at that point a smile had appeared on the body's face.

"I tried my best to hide it from you, but I think we have played long enough. It looks like you're still lacking when it comes to fighting. It's been a long time since I had a body of my own, and yours is truly strong, but I guess you still can't beat experience." The body replied.

'My body, it's speaking, and what the hell is it saying?' Quinn thought completely confused, it was then that he remembered what Shiro said to him after looking inside.

There was more than one consciousness inside his body.

'It couldn't be…'

*******

# Chapter 1213 Hug it ou
When trying to communicate with the Dalki, no words were spoken at all. Dalki could talk and have conversations with each other and humans. However, when Quinn had left his own body, he had never expected it to speak, but right now, not only was it talking, but it sounded like it was a completely different person.

This led him to think back to when Shiro had seen inside Quinn's mind to talk to Oscar. That his body currently contained two conciseness. He didn't exactly know how it worked, especially with the system, but that could only mean that the person talking now was…

"Vincent?" Quinn called out, a bit unsure if it was the case or not.

Quinn's body smiled back. "Look, I know I'm usefully more handsome than this, but it's the best I could do." Soon he was walking up to Quinn and looked up, placing his hands on his abs.

"How? How are you able to use my body? Aren't you stuck in the system? I thought it was linked. Is it because of the Amulet? I mean, it has to be." Quinn continued to ask multiple questions as he was stunned. Honestly, more than anything, he was unprepared for a meeting like so.

"Does that even matter?" Vincent asked as he continued to weirdly touch the Dalki's body. He didn't say anything but Vincent was actually trying to analyse what the creature was like. Stuck in the system, he had heard and learnt so much about them but had never met one in person. He felt like a baby who was experiencing senses for the first time again.

Although Quinn was mostly ignoring this. "The Dalki are quite tall, or maybe this body is short?" Vincent placed his finger on his chin before looking into Quinn's eyes.

"Honestly, I wanted to tell you something for a long time now, Quinn, and I was waiting until we were face to face. However, this might be the best chance I ever get to say it. So I'm going to say it now. I'm proud of you.

"When I created that book, I never thought anything like this would happen. I left it for our family. I wasn't sure if it would ever be needed. Of course, I thought something might happen far off into the future, but being on this journey along with you and everything you have been through, I never wished for it. Still, you were able to take everything on in your full stride, and I think more than anything I need to tell you how much of a good job you have done."

This wasn't the first time that Vincent had given Quinn praise. He had heard it numerous times as a voice in his head. Every time he did hear them, there was an overwhelming warm feeling inside him. This was why he was wondering this time, why there was a different feeling. He was trying the best he could to hold down the lump in his throat.

"Vincent…I hated you." Quinn said.

Hearing this, Vincent took a step back and tilted his head, looking at him strangely.

"At first, I mean. I hated your cocky attitude, how you would keep secrets from me when you could have helped out more. There were times where I didn't even completely trust you, thinking you were working for your own goal rather than mine, but I slowly realised that honestly, throughout all of this, there was one person who was always by my side and who had been dragged into this just as much as I was. Thank you."

After expressing their feelings, there was an awkward moment between the two of them. They had even turned both ways to face each other. Until Vincent, being the older one, turned back around.

"Why don't you give your grandpa a hug, huh?"

Before Quinn could do anything, the ground started to shake. More pods were shot out from the mothership and were landing. Interrupting the moment and they knew what they both needed to do.

Now knowing that Quinn was able to control his body while he was in another, Quinn had a few more questions he needed to do to find out what exactly was different. After asking a series of questions, Quinn found that his body was still mostly controlled by the Amulet more than he thought.

Whenever Quinn would give a command, Vincent claimed that the body would allow him to only do so much. Controlling it based on the restrictions set from the command itself. Based on the instructions given, it would also allow him to use the system, which was why Vincent, even with no prior knowledge of using the shadow powers, was able to.

There was a simple fix to this though, Quinn would simply command his body that it was free to do as he wished, and now Vincent could control it how he liked with full access to the system, also taking it away whenever he wanted as well.

"Wow, this is really a cheat. You don't have to think about doing anything. You can just access the system and use whatever you like. If any of the vampires knew about this, they would all want their own system." Vincent said after testing out a few skills. To a certain extent, Vincent knew what it was like, but knowing about it and experiencing it were two different things.

The last thing Quinn wanted to check was if there was anything that could be done with the Amulet to allow Vincent to control the Dalki body. However, no matter what they tried, it just wasn't possible. When Quinn would return to his own body, Vincent would return to the system, back to how he was.

On top of that, Vincent didn't have control of the Amulet's abilities. Only Quinn did. So whenever he wished, he could take energy from his own body, making him stronger.

"With all the tests done, I guess it's time for us to get to work", Quinn said.

"What do you want me to do? We've gotten this far mostly due to your own judgment, so I'll listen to whatever plan you have." Vincent said.

————

With Vincent in full control, Quinn, still in the Dalki body, they both went along to the mothership. Vincent was still having fun using the shadow skills and was currently heading straight towards the mothership. When they were getting close, Vincent would stay on standby a little distance away, and now Quinn in the Dalki body was ready to do what he had planned.

Just like with the last mothership, there was a camp that was being built underneath the mother ship. It looked to be more along the way compared to the last one. As if a fortress was to be made to stay there long term if need be.

Quinn's plan was to disguise himself within the Dalki group, hoping he could deal with the problem a lot easier while fighting as little as possible and losing as few lives as possible as well. After telling Vincent to give him a few scratches here and there, Quinn could feel the power of the Dalki blood energising him; it was different to the power he would take for himself with the Amulet. It was more of a raw energy.

Next he was off and heading straight for the camp. With his injuries on his body, the Dalki immediately came running towards him.

'This is good. This Dalki was from the scout team, so they should ask me what I saw if I'm like this.' Quinn thought. When the first Dalki reached him, he soon saw a fist coming towards his face, and the next second, his back was planted on the floor.

'What just happened? Did the Dalki just hit me? Could they tell it wasn't one of them?' Quinn thought.

"How could you come back alive!" The Dalki yelled. "We do not retreat!"

The Dalki had a significantly different culture compared to the humans, and Quinn needed to come up with a pretty good reason why he had returned.

"I need to make a report. All of our squads were wiped out, and it was by a vampire!" Quinn said, hoping this would be enough. "They said if we ran into them, we needed to head to the mothership."

Of course, Quinn didn't know if this was true or not. He didn't even know if the Dalki knew about other vampires, but he did know that the Dalki were working with vampires. To find out a vampire was killing their kind had to be big news.

After huffing and panting, it looked like some Dalki took the initial one away. Although most of them were hot-headed, it didn't seem that all of them were. Quinn was thankful for this. Eventually, another Dalki had approached him.

"It's good you came back alive. I heard that one of our Dalki ships was destroyed. Graham thinks that it couldn't have just been done by the humans alone and told us to report on everything. Head to the mother ship and inform them."

This was what Quinn was hoping for. After entering one of the smaller ships, Quinn was allowed to enter the mother ship. Once he was on board, he knew the place's layout relatively well due to being on the last one. However, he needed to travel by foot, and he had made a couple of wrong turns at some point, but he had eventually found the room he was looking for, the room where the jamming devices were located.

"What are you doing here!" A guard shouted.

Last time, Quinn had made a distraction, and the guards had run all over the place, but this time two one spiked Dalki stood by the door.

There could be no survivors knowing what Quinn was doing. Using the power of the Amulet, he started to transfer energy to himself. He grew stronger, and then when he walked up close to the guards, he grabbed both of them by the head and smashed them together as hard as he could. The skulls could be felt cracking, and green blood spilt from their foreheads.

The Dalki were caught completely off guard, never expecting such a thing. The next second, while dazed, Quinn lifted up both of his elbows, slamming down as hard as he could on top of their heads once again. It was a deadly blow.

'With the increase of my own body's power, I raised it to the same strength as a two spiked Dalki. We can do this. With Vincent in my body, he will be able to fight as well. He can protect the Shelters while I go off and destroy the motherships.'

Not long after, and the mother ship was seen falling from the sky once again.

******

# Chapter 1214 Abandon the ship
When transferring energy from himself to the Dalki's body that Quinn was currently in. He made sure not to overdo it for a few reasons. The first there was simply no need to. The power of a two spike was simply too much for any one spike to deal with. This was something that could be used to their advantage because even though Quinn had the power of a two spike, two spikes did not appear on his body.

However, there was still Vincent who was outside roaming close to the camp. During the testing the energy that was transferred to the Dalki body would eventually be returned, but if he was to take up too much energy, it would only make his body weaker. At the end of the day, the Dalki could die, but Quinn's original body could not.

The next task was for Quinn to escape from the ship, it took a lot to get one Mark and he didn't want to go through the process again. With the ship floating down falling from the sky, Quinn needed to brace himself. Another Dalki had already taken the ship he had come in and flown off.

'I guess I can only jump off and hope it doesn't break my legs.' Quinn thought. 'Wait a second.' Another idea had struck him.

Eventually, when going to the outside area, he found the spot where he wanted to jump from. Powering his legs and using the Dalki's incredible strength, he managed to leap through the air going a great distance away from the ship. Still, he would be affected by the ship's crash if he stayed in the area.

When coming close to the ground, he could eventually see a shadow beneath him, touching it slowed down his velocity and he was able to safely land in one piece after entering the shadow space.

'I see you have gotten the hang of using my body." Quinn said.

"And it looks like you did a good job as well." Vincent replied back.

Now heading back to the Shelter, Quinn decided to switch so he was back in his own body. He wanted to still practice using the demon tier amulet more and controlling the Dalki. He didn't have much time to practice, so he had to use all the spare time he could get, at the same time there was something else that he wanted to check out.

'Its as I thought. Even though I destroyed another Dalki ship, it didn't add to the quest. After all this is one of those that belong in the Graylash faction. So I need to destroy all the ones in the Cursed faction area.'

Looking through his system, he soon found even more bad news, a third planet had been taken over. Quinn knew what he was doing though. At the rate the planets were being taken over there was no way for him to complete the quest, unless he was able to receive some help of some kind and this was most likely the only way.

Looking at the system even further, Quinn noticed one last change that had happened.

[Amulet slots 1/2]

'It increased, but how? Did it also take the energy from the Dalki I killed as a mark?' When looking at himself, he noticed that there was some fresh green blood on his two gauntlets. Blood that couldn't have been there too long.

'Looks like you caught me.' Vincent said. 'While you were in there, I decided to roam around a bit, and I came across another scouting group. They spotted me so I really had no choice, and it looks like it helped you out in the end.'

If it was anyone else controlling his body, Quinn perhaps would have said it was risky, but it was clear that Vincent was a skilled leader who had some fighting capabilities, even though he wasn't much of a fighting leader in the past.

'With another slot, I can get another Dalki that will just help us out even more.'

———

Heading back they soon saw the Shelter ahead of them. Everyone was in high spirits. The attacking Dalki had been dealt with, so they had time to rest and organise themselves. On top of that, they just witnessed the enemy mothership falling.

However, during this time, nearly everyone had their eyes glued to a screen of some kind. At least the civilians inside and the members of the Cursed faction.

Going through the Shelter, Quinn soon found himself in a large hall where all the injured were being placed. Inside here was where Linda and Wevil were present sitting next to each other against a wall.

Popping out of the shadow, Quinn appeared.

"Quinn! Behind you!" Linda screamed seeing him, and immediately launched forward with her fist but the punch was soon stopped by Quinn himself. Wevil too was quick on his feet grabbing his dagger and went to attack the Dalki, but Quinn suddenly appeared in front of him as well, slapping the dagger out of his hand.

'Oh right I completely forgot, this is the normal reaction if one was to see a Dalki.'

[Shadow lock]

'It should be fine if he stays in the shadow space, right?' Quinn thought.

———

After explaining himself, and why exactly he had a Dalki with him, the panic and almost heart attack Linda had received had settled down.

"Why would you do that? It's a good thing a lot of people weren't watching you and you got rid of it quickly." Linda complained. "Still, I can't believe you can really control a Dalki, and more than one. That's nearly stronger than an ability. Demon tier items are really something else."

While Linda was thinking of the amazing things one could do with the Demon tier item, she soon felt Wevil giving her a nudge and saw him point to his wrist watch where the video he was watching was still playing.

"Oh right, Quinn there's something you have to see." Linda said, and soon bringing up the video, Quinn could see what was currently happening on the Cursed ship. At the moment, the video was switching between many perspectives.

It showed that a group of Dalki were on board and the Cursed faction were fighting against them, not just them though. There were also ability users that Quinn didn't recognise.

"I know you've been busy so I'll try to give you as much information as I know." Linda started to explain. "The Cursed faction were suddenly attacked by the Blade family, but they had sent a load of ability users first, perhaps to weaken our forces. Later on though, they ended up coming themselves, the Blade family. I don't know when, or how but the Dalki started to invade the Cursed ship as well."

Quinn had gathered that from what he knew before, watching the videos Quinn did see some good. The Cursed and Chained that were fighting just moments ago. As soon as the Dalki appeared, they had almost put their battles aside to deal with the oncoming threat. That's when the video had finally changed to another scene. A fight between a five spiked Dalki with a large long tail, and Hilston.

The two of them were in the training room going back and forth, neither one giving in.

"Tell Logan or Sam that the teleporters are back online on some of the planets. Get the Cursed faction members that are unable to fight to come to the Daisy faction or here.Worst case scenario abandon the Cursed ship. They don't need to risk their lives fighting for it." Quinn answered.

"Wait Quinn, you're not going to go back and fight them!" Wevil said surprised after hearing his answer.

"From the looks of things, the situation had actually gotten better for them since the Dalki invaded. The Dalki and Hilston seem to be equal in power but in the end one of them will lose out. Sil is still there and I can tell if someone is in serious danger. At any point I can travel to them. If I went now, honestly I'm not sure I could beat either one of them.

"The Cursed ship isn't my only responsibility, and something dangerous is happening at the Cursed planets as well."

Something in Quinn's gut was telling him that the takeover of the Cursed planets were unnatural. He could tell when arriving on this planet. The Dalki were making a base, planning to stay here a long time, thinking that the battle would last.

So just what was taking over the Cursed planets so fast.

******


# Chapter 1215 Last wish
Before leaving the place, Quinn wanted to check with Ko, the faction leader, if they would now be okay with him leaving. As he was ready to leave the faction base, he had Linda and Wevil following behind and had stopped by his office. The base itself was one of the few places that had been least affected by the attack and was also doubling up as a safe centre for civilians. This Shelter has suffered a lot, and even more so since the Graylash faction were unable to help them like they had done on the other planets.

Quinn still felt like he was partly to blame, perhaps if he had found out what was the cause of the Marked and what the Demon tier beast was earlier, more could have survived, especially Robin.

"Quinn, honestly I heard about all the other bases being attacked and I have seen part of the Broadcast. I'm quite surprised you even came here, but you don't have to worry about us. The stray Dalki left out there will take a while until they do anything. Besides we are a strong faction."

Hearing this had settled Quinn's heart a little, for he had planned to take the other Cursed members back with him. Usually, Quinn would try to complete quests on his own, but he knew he needed all the help he could get.

"I know these people belong to the Graylash faction, but you and I have been through a lot. The teleporters to the Daisy planet are up and running. I believe it's one of the only few places that are. If there is a sudden attack, then the safest place to retreat to would be there." Quinn answered.

With that said and done, Quinn was ready to leave the base and outside was the last member of the Cursed faction. Alex Stood there waiting, but he wasn't alone and he looked kind of nervous.

"What the?" Wevil commented, rubbing his eyes. "Am I seeing things, or does that large muscular man have the same set of wings as Alex as well?" Wevil asked.

Quinn was about to ask the same thing but now knowing that it wasn't some type of hallucination, he soon used his inspect skill.

[Blood fairy]

'Another Blood fairy? His wings are twice the size Alex's, but then again, Andrew is twice the size of him as well. For a second I thought he might have been another subclass.'

Knowing that the forger Andrew worked closely together with Alex, Quinn had an idea of what most likely happened.

'I warn you that this will be another thing that will need to be hidden from the vampire society. One of them, you could perhaps play it off as a subclass that you never intended to create, but with two, there is a good chance that any of the leaders could use this as a case that you were planning to go against them.' Vincent warned.

'At the moment that is the least of my worries. If Alex wishes to save someone he feels is close to him and worth saving, then I will agree with his decision and support him.' Quinn replied.

There was also another reason why Quinn wasn't so against the idea of having two blood fairies. Andrew was considered one of the top forgers in the world and Quinn was thinking of ways to convince him over to their side.

"Quinn, look I can explain." Alex started to get defensive, and by the look on Andrew's face, it looked like Alex had already gone over explaining the difficult part of things.

"Don't worry, I'm sure you had your reasons. Come on, we need to get out of here." Quinn said, as they headed to a special room located around the back of the main faction building. A place where all the teleporters had been placed. It seemed like the Dalki didn't even bother to attack such a place since they knew that they were unable to use them and it was why Quinn had to destroy the mothership despite the fact that it didn't help out with his Quest.

"When we get back, Linda, Wevil, I want you two to head to one of the Cursed planets KunKun, I will be heading to a different one to the two of you. Make sure you keep your shadow abilities active at all times. That way I can hop over to where you are when I can." Quinn ordered.

"Wait, don't you think it will be safer if we all go together. I know your strong Quinn, but there might also be Dalki that even we can't face." Linda replied. "We were struggling there enough as it is."

It was hard for Quinn to say why, because really he was doing it mainly due to his quest, but that would mean he would have to explain the system to them all.

"The Dalki seemed to be building a base of some kind on each of the planets, and at the same time none of the Shelters could get help due to the teleporters being jammed. We need to get rid of those teleporters as quickly as possible. The only way to travel at the moment is via ship. If we both head to different planets. Once I am done dealing with the mothership on my end, I can use my shadow link to travel to you two.

"The idea is, me and Alex will travel towards the Cursed faction in one sector. While you two in the other. After dealing with the mother ship, I'll hop over to you two and deal with the Dalki there, while Alex makes his way to another planet, and soon hop back."

To the Cursed members there it sounded like a lot of work, but they had learnt that somehow Quinn was already able to take out two of the Dalki ships. It was clear that this was something that only he could do.

"Quinn, I also managed to finish this." Alex said, handing over Quinn's red mask that he had given to Alex a while ago. "I managed to use that upgraded crystal and it looks like it worked. I increased it from the emperor tier and now it's at the legendary tier. I know you're plenty strong already, but every little bit helps, right?"

Using his inspect skill, Quinn looked at the stats of the mask. Originally it was an incomplete emperor tier item so it didn't grant the user much. But it did have a passive skill that allowed one's adrenaline points to rise, which in turn could boost a single stat.

"Alex, bringing you along will be dangerous. You don't have the best equipment yourself. Even here you had to face some trouble, so I think it's best if you keep it, and I don't want you or Andrew to wait any longer. Make yourselves the best equipment you can. You have to protect yourselves before you can protect others.

"The same goes for you Quinn." Alex said smiling.

——

Returning to the Daisy planet, Quinn could see that things were good here. The walls were just as intact as they were before, a few members were injured but they were light injuries. It seemed while he was away the few Dalki that were still out and about on the planet, had attempted an attack, but had failed.

[3/10 planets lost]

Looking at the Quest, Quinn didn't even have time to explain to Helen what he was doing but just quickly updated her on everything. Telling her that he had informed people that they could come to them for protection. He also requested another ship, for Wevil and Linda's use.

Helen had returned to give Quinn the news that both of the ships he had requested were ready.

"Wait Quinn, with the teleporters active, more people from the planets will start to come to the Shelter. I'm sure the Dalki will catch on to this, and they may even target this planet again as an excuse for it. Which is why I can't go with you, but I have received news and the other planets need help. So eight of the blood weapon users that helped fight with you before are coming with you. I have split them up into two groups to go along with you."

Last time, two of them had lost their lives because they had decided to come and help Quinn, but he couldn't deny that they could help fight off the enemies at the Shelter while he did what he needed to do.

"Thank you." Quinn answered as he was ready to leave, turning around, he soon felt someone grab his hand and pull him in. Based on the strength used, he knew it wasn't an enemy and soon saw the one pulling him was Helen.

Her face went in close to his, his mind was freezing in the moment, and before he knew it she had grabbed him by the scruff off his neck and pulled him in. Pressing her lips against his.

'There so…soft..'Quinn thought at that moment.

She had let go, and had a guilty look on her face.

"I'm sorry Quinn, but I just had to be even more selfish just this once. If I told you I wasn't scared I would be lying. With the war going on, I have already seen people dying and getting reports from all the other planets. There is a good chance that maybe you and I will never see each other again after this, and if I didn't kiss you at least once. I would have died with a huge regret."

After saying these words, Helen looked at Quinn expecting some sort of answer from him, and Quinn could see this as well, but while thinking about her, another girl had popped into his head.

'Quinn, don't not now, instead use this to encourage her.' Vincent came in before Quinn could say what he was about to say.

"I wont accept it. I won't accept that as your last wish. You want to experience more things like this right? Well then live and don't die, that way you have the chance to experience it again, because I won't be dying."

# Chapter 1216 Catching up
The Cursed group that was now helping Quinn along with his quest had been split up into two. Wevil, Linda, and four of the blood weapon users for support, then there was Quinn and his group. Alex and Andrew had been brought along, only Alex needed to come, but Andrew insisted on staying with Alex. More than anything, he was curious about the changes in his body and had multiple questions he wanted to ask.

Even now, Quinn could hear the two of them talk about it during their journey.

"I knew the Cursed faction had V, but after working with you closely, I never saw any signs that you were one. The other forgers would spill their blood constantly, and there were no signs at all." Andrew said.

Although the two forgers had been pretty much living under a rock as they worked day and night to complete the Demon tier amulet, it was news that had even become known to them.

"Well, that's because now me and you are not quite the same as V. We work slightly differently and are a subclass of them of some kind. If the V had these giant red wings on their back, they would be pretty easy to spot." Alex couldn't help but stare at the giant wings on Andre's back.

They were too large and powerful to be tied down or hidden underneath some type of clothing. The other four blooded weapon users on the ship with them couldn't stop staring as well, as if they were hypnotised by the red colour.

'Damn, am I feeling a little jealous?' Alex thought.

Iree, Yag, and two other females Anna and Ting had come on board from the blooded weapon users. They had been ordered by Quinn to do one thing, to protect Alex. Unlike the time before, they would not come with Quinn heading towards the Dalki mothership.

——-

Soon they could see one of the Shelters of the planet under attack. They had yet to enter the Shelter, but there was fighting around a hundred meters from the place. It seemed like they were faring better as Quinn could see some Dalki bodies on the hard orange ground in different areas, far from the Shelter.

'This was the planet that had been handed the Blood weapons, and one of the ones Helen is planning to reinforce. In total, I think she said the Cursed are going to try and keep six planets. This means the evacuation of the others are still in progress.

'The weaker planets probably needed more help with the process, but this was one of the closer ones. I'm sorry for all the lives I can't save.' Quinn thought.

Still, in the air, they were soon approaching the Shelter. Quinn slammed a large red button on the side, and soon the back of the ship started to open up.

"Everyone, let's go, jump!" Quinn Shouted, breaking through the loud sound of the wind.

"From all the way up here!" Alex was a little nervous.

"Look at everyone else. They seem ready." Andrew said. "Shouldn't we be the least worried since we have wings?"

Still, despite that Alex had never jumped from so high before, why couldn't they just wait and land the ship like everyone else? Regardless, he soon saw Quinn jumping out of the ship and the others along with him.

They were falling through the air. The velocity of the ship made it so they were shooting right past the Shelter and instead were heading for where the fighting was taking place a few hundred meters past it.

"Don't worry," Iree said to Alex. the two of them were falling through the sky, and one had a clear panicked look on his face. Alex made it so his wings were as close to his back as possible, afraid that the strong wind resistance would hurt them. "If we look calm, it's because we have Quinn."

In the middle of the air, Quinn unleashed the Dalki that was in his shadow lock, appearing next to him.

There were around twelve Dalki in total on the ground. A squad leader of around fifty or so people fighting, and a few of them with blood weapons.

"What is that?" One of them asked as they could see several people falling from the sky. Just as the people were about to crash into the hard ground, a large dome of shadow appeared, covering the centre area where the Dalki were bunched up. The next second, the shadow fell to the ground, and Quinn was seen with the others standing behind thier weapons drawn. Setting off, Quinn was already fighting against the Dalki.

In seconds Quinn had turned the battle. He swung out his fist, firing off large blood swipes, stopping them from getting close to the others. Blood drills were formed, killing Dalki on the spot, and Qi punches were made, sending the unmatched creature in strength, flying through the sky.

What was strange for most of them was that a Dalki was saying by Quinn's side, helping him do everything, until there was only one left.

"I'm going to need a bit of my own space for this," Quinn said, using the shadow Void skill to create a dome over his Dalki and the other he had captured. Using the amulet, he had planned to capture another Dalki since a second slot had opened up.

'Last time, it took three tries to just get one of these. I wonder how long it will take this time.' Quinn thought.

However, when the amulet lit up, the light from it soon faded away. He found himself with a notification screen that put a grin on his face.

[Marking has been successful]

There was something Quinn needed to see quickly, and the first thing was how easy it was to control two Dalki simultaneously. Quinn found it difficult, and the easiest thing to do was to try and puppet one of their movements while giving simple commands to the other.

The good thing was that even if Quinn was in complete control of One Dalki, he could still puppet the other relatively well.

"Alright, Vincent, it's time I leave everything over to you. Just please, don't do anything weird while you're in my body." Quinn asked.

When the shadow void field went down, two Dalki were seen jumping off in the distance, and the plan was in motion.

"What the hell was that?" Iree asked.

"Don't worry about that, beautiful, just some things I can do. Leave that ship to them." Vincent said, making Iree blush.

While the others headed back to the Shelter, Vincent stayed observing the outer area. This Shelter seemed to suffer from more planned attacks than the other two planets they had been on. They were pretty careful in what they were doing.

It looked like each Dalki had their own strategy that they were implementing. In the end, those in the Shelter didn't have to do anything because once Vincent was stood outside those doors, not a single group of Dalki ever touched those walls again.

After an hour, so the good news had arrived, Vincent could see the notification screen popping up in front of him.

[2/10 Dalki mother ships destroyed]

But at the same time, while Quinn was away.

[5/10 Cursed planets have been taken over]

"Come on, Quinn, you need to be quicker!" Vincent said.

———

The full plan was now in motion. Vincent ordered Alex to get on moving with the others towards the next planet, and when they arrived, to just stay at the Shelter with thier shadow active. Vincent then headed towards the now two Dalki bodies, and once having switched, the Dalki were placed in the shadow lock. Quinn was able to travel to where Wevil and Linda were, bringing them along.

The good news was, with Vincent fighting, he had unlocked a third slot in the amulet. Growing Quinn's army of Dalki even more so. This pattern repeated, and having no need to travel in space, and having obtained a third Dalki after a few failures, the third ship had been taken down.

[3/10 Dalki mother ships have been destroyed]

By the time Quinn had dealt with the third ship, travelling back to Alex, they had swiftly arrived at the planet, and the process was repeated once more.

[4/10 Dalki ship have been destroyed]

[6/10 Cursed planets have been taken over]

"I'm catching up! But I need to move along faster!"

After catering three Dalki, a fourth slot never seemed to open up, despite how much Dalki Vincent was killing. They didn't know if it was due to the energy being too low from one spiked Dalki. It Was a shame because the next thing they wanted to try and do was capture a two spike Dalki.

On top of that, Quinn's plan this time on the fifth Dalki ship didn't quite go to plan. After infiltrating the base in many different ways, it looked like the Dalki were communicating with each other.

After entering the ship and heading to the usual jammer room. Quinn, controlling one of the Dalki, had gone inside after killing the guards, but suddenly, he could see three spiked Dalki inside guarding the room. A fist had come towards his face, delivering a blow that his current body couldn't withstand.

The next second he felt his limbs being torn apart, and before Quinn could do anything, he had been killed.

After doing so, he was now back in his original body at the Shelter. In front of him was a bowl of grapes, and a woman he had never seen before sat by his side.

"What the hell is Vincent doing?"

'Well, this Shelter wasn't attacked like all the others, and there doesn't;t seem to be any scout groups. I checked the area, but I can't go too far off. I have to protect the place, right?' Vincent answered calmly.

Quinn quickly returned to the two Dalki that were on board, and they were in the midst of battle. Using the power of the amulet, Quinn gave a huge surge of energy to one of the Dalki's enough so that the two of them could eventually beat the three spike, and the ship was taken down.

[5/10 Dalki ships have been destroyed]

[6/10 Cursed planets have been destroyed]

Quinn was relieved seeing this. The ship had taken longer than usual, so he thought that the planet takeover would have progressed quicker than he thought.

'Maybe the Dalki or person who is the cause of all of this is struggling on one of the planets?' Quinn thought.

Having lost one Dalki, Quinn wasn't too over the moon. He also didn't have enough time to explore what Vincent had actually done while in his body, because once again, they were off to where Wevil and Linda were currently at, a planet called Oturn.

———

At the same time, a certain Dalki was currently on one of the mother ships inside the command centre.

"Graham, what are you doing here? I thought you were on a different fleet." A three spiked Dalki said.

"I'm sure you have heard, our ships are being destroyed left and right. There has to be a reason for this, and if you study, the pattern is clear. The next planet is planet Oturn, which is why I am here."

# Chapter 1217 The impossible ques
Although the new Supreme commander Sach was currently staying at the snow-filled Shelter along with Head general Samantha, he had yet to leave such a place because they knew that One Horn was present on the planet.

Their forces had suffered a few skirmishes here and there, but the Dalki still hadn't managed to get past the first trench that had been created by the group. Since the V now were no longer present within the army, Samantha's tactics on defence were working far better.

They had reinforced their defences, moving slowly, gaining territory further and further away from the land. The close combat ability users would be present in the trenches that were now covered in snow. Making it harder for the Dalki to pinpoint where they were.

Traps could be cleverly implemented, and this time, no one would be informing the enemy side.

At the same time, towers with far ranged ability users were scouting to spot the Dalki before they arrived. Before, Samantha's goal was trying to get rid of the mothership or the base that the Dalki was trying to set up.

However, after learning of One Horn, they decided that the slower approach was best.

Sitting in his makeshift office was Sach, who was getting reports after reports.

"Quinn, what the hell are you doing that is allowing you to take down the motherships so quickly? " Sach wondered. Despite asking the faction leaders what had occurred, it sounded like they didn't know much, and even worse, Sach could see that the Cursed faction ship was still in trouble.

'Two planets have been evacuated so far from the Earthborn group, but I told them to detour to planet Kimbar since One Horn is here. It's a good thing that the Cursed faction sent us their two army groups, but once the evacuation is done, what to do next?'

This was what Sach was struggling with because rather than looking at individual battles, Sach was still trying to look at the war as a whole. After the Dalki had attacked, they had gotten more information on the entire situation.

The Dalki had enough Motherships to send one to every single planet that the Earth owned. It had come as quite the surprise to him that the Dalki had this many forces, but still, the humans were outnumbering them ten thousand to one, not that it meant much in the first place.

Because there just weren't many humans that were strong enough to outnumber the Dalki.

'It might be best to send Nathan and the other group to attack the Dalki planets just like they had done ours. Their forces could be spread thin, and it might get them to split up. If they aren't expecting it, we can blitz the planets and move out, easing the pressure on our own forces. Or there is another option.

'Why is One Horn even here in the first place?' Sach was thinking about the planet where he had confronted One Horn with the others. 'Oscar had told us to attack the planet that belonged to the Earthborn group because he was afraid they might use it to attack us in the future. We are in a severe situation now, yet there has been no action from that planet at all. On top of that, if One Horn is here, it means that he isn't there either.

'Maybe, sending Nathan there might be the best thing, and we can find out why the Dalki find that place so important in the first place.'

He still hadn't made up his mind, but what Sach had to keep in mind was even if they successfully defended their planets from this current attack and got rid of the Dalki mother ships, the war wasn't over because there was still the Dalki planets themselves remaining, and thinking about this, he still had no clear way of just how they were going to win this war.

———

Planet Ortun was a dark planet where the ground was primarily black. It had a challenging environment where part of the ground would spew up hot molten lava at times. It wasn't the best place for humans to live in, but the setting did encourage strong beasts to roam, which was why it was an important planet for the Cursed faction.

Arriving at the Shelter and meeting up with Weevil and Linda, Quinn was surprised at how small it was, but this was most likely due to the environment. It was one of the few places where no such civilians lived, and the only people that were there were high-level travellers.

"I heard about this place, but it's so far out I never visited here," Iree said, as she saw what looked like a giant volcano in the distance erupt, it spewed lava down its sides, and smoke could be seen rising from the top.

"The Shelter is on the small side. I think only around two hundred or so Travelers actually live here." Yag added. "It seems like the Shelter wasn't attacked at all. Even the Dalki will have a hard time travelling on this terrain."

Quinn wasn't sure about that one, even more so since using the Dlaki's body, he was coming to learn just how resistant their hard scales were. It was no wonder that bullets of the past were unable to penetrate their problematic skin.

'If the Dalki aren't attacking the Shelter, it might be best if I come with you Quinn for this one like the first planet. After all, you know how much we struggled on the last one." Vincent suggested.

It was true, the Dalki were catching on to Quinn's plans, and there was a good chance that they would have increased the defences on the ship itself, so the plan that he had implemented so far wouldn't work out this time.

'You have a point, then I think what we should try and do is get our third slot back. It could be a big help to us in the end.'

With that agreed by the two of them, they were soon off searching the unforgivable land for the Dalki. At the moment, Quinn was in complete control of his body, and he was trying his best to control both of the Dalki more accurately.

Soon they came across a strange giant caterpillar creature. Its body looked like it was made of fur, but Quinn thought that was impossible as it had seen it crawl over a small stream of hot lava without it catching fire or burning. It was also difficult to see since its fur looked to be camouflaged similarly to the ground it was on.

This was the perfect test for Quinn. He controlled the two Dalki, moving them to defeat the king tier beast. While being a puppet master of one, Quinn was noticing something interesting from the other. Although he had just given it simple commands, it seemed to now be fighting in a different style to what it had done before.

Before, it was fighting similar to how the Dalki would fight on their born natural instincts, but now the Dalki was using the skills Quinn knew known as Muay baron. Soon Quinn had defeated the beast with the Dalki and had obtained its crystal.

'There fighting techniques are evolving as I use them more and more. They are no longer just a normal one spiked Dalki. I wonder if this information is permanent or if they die, they have to learn the skills all over again as I get a new Marked?' Quinn thought.

Thinking about evolving, he also thought about something else. The first Dalki Quinn had defeated on the mother ship said. That Dalki said they grew from hard battles. Growing in strength, breaking down and healing again.

Did it mean that it was also possible for Quinn to grow the Marked Dalki that he controlled? If so, there would be no need for him to try and waste time getting a two spiked Dalki. He could just evolve his own.

It was an interesting thought that could help Quinn in the future, but now wasn't the time. Continuing to head towards the giant mothership in the sky, Quinn had come across his first set of Dalki that were out roaming about. It looked like they were currently having trouble facing off against beasts that naturally roamed the planet as well.

'I guess the beasts from the other planets had stayed clear of them, but these ones are a little different to the usual.' Quinn gathered.

Finding the right time, Quinn went in to deal with them along with his two Dalki. He was getting used to the right amount of energy he needed to supply them with to efficiently deal with an opponent in equal strength. However, now that they were learning his fighting skills, they could still fight other Dalki with even less borrowed energy from Quinn.

Lastly, they had captured the last Dalki and had unlocked the third slot. So far, the process of marking a Dalki had been a strange one. He was unlucky at first, being successful on his third try. Still, sometimes it would take him five times. Sometimes he would be successful on his first go, which made it hard for Quinn to exactly know the odds of capturing a Dalki or if he had just been unlucky or lucky.

However, soon he had obtained his third Dalki once again.

"Alright, It's time to head to the mothership again. We'll do this one together, Vincent." Quinn said, but just before he was about to leave, a disastrous message had appeared in front of him, updating him about the quest.

[7/10 Cursed planets have been taken over]

[8/10 Cursed planets have been taken over]

[9/10 Cursed planets have been taken over]

Quinn couldn't believe his eyes, despite everything he had done, it looked like his quest might still fail after all.

******

# Chapter 1218 Fight for me
Seeing the first notification screen pop up, Quinn wasn't too overwhelmed. He knew that at some point, he would see a notification pop up saying that one of the Cursed planets had been taken over. Especially since it had been a long time since one appeared. Seeing it was a reminder that he had to keep marching on.

However, soon after, not just one notification appeared but two more. Now he was only one planet away from the quest failing. His eyes couldn't leave the number as he read it over and over.

'Just…one more?' Quinn's whole hand was shaking as a feeling of dread was coming over him. His stomach was churning, wanting to escape from himself, and he started to feel incredibly cold.

'What is happening to me?' Not even Quinn understood himself why he was feeling this way.

He never thought just failing a quest from the System would make him feel like so, but there was a reason for it all, and it was his own fault.

Quinn had already sacrificed so much for the quest. He had no clue what was happening to those in the Cursed faction. The fighting had started multiple hours ago, and he could tell from the bond that they were still fighting.

Still, he told himself it was for the quest. Once he would complete the quest, he could go off to help them. He had put the quest up so high above in importance, above everything else, telling himself that if he was to fail this quest, he wouldn't be able to help the Cursed planets or those in the Cursed faction from Hilston.

It was the only way he could concentrate on such a task while other things were going on.

All of these thoughts had been used for motivation, and now they had come crashing down crushing him until his last breath.

'Quinn, Quinn!' Vincent yelled in his mind, grabbing his attention. 'Don't lose hope! The quest isn't complete yet, and there is always something that we can do! Don't let a stupid system be the decider of everything before it actually happens. There are still things we can do.'

Quinn awkwardly laughed inside. The System had already decided his course of actions for him. It was why he was in this challenging situation in the first place. Once again, the thought of the System being an actual Curse rather than a gift came to mind.

Swiping away the notification screen, Quinn looked at the Dalki mothership in front of him. It was still a far distance away, and he needed to take down five more.

Not just five more, but five more before the Dalki took over one. How long would that even take? Quinn wouldn't be surprised if the next notification screen appeared any second, failing him.

'What happened? How did three get taken over so fast? I thought with the long waiting period something must have happened?' As Quinn was thinking things through, there was really only one answer he could come up with. It had to do with the planet evacuations. If a few of them were complete or in the middle of their process, the quest would mark them as having lost their planets.

Quinn had managed to convince Helen to try not to concentrate the forces too much in one place, but in the end, he couldn't just tell her not to try and save people's lives just because he was worried that the System might make him weaker if he fails. There wasn't even a guarantee that it would be the case. Then how would he feel after if he was to ignore the quest?

'Quinn, I have a suggestion that might not solve our problem but gives us a chance.' Vincent said. 'I'll be honest with you, I agree with your train of thought. Due to how big of a quest this is and based on what has happened in the past, I think that the rewards would be good if we were to complete this quest.

'After all, if the System really is using my ability, my powers within itself, then just this level of a task is too high. Which I hate to say, but I think that if we were to fail, it would also mean that the penalty would be large as well.'

This wasn't what Quinn wanted to hear, so he was starting to wonder just where Vincent was going with all of this.

'If we fail the quest and you can't complete it, then there is a chance you could go down a few levels, your stats are affected or something else. I know your worries. You worry that you're not strong enough to face Hilston, or the five spiked Dalki he is facing, but if your stats went down, then it would just be the same. This is why I think we should use this time. At this moment, all of your stats are unaffected!'

'So I should just give up on the quest, abandon all of these people on the Cursed planets? Even if I didn't complete it, I should at least help them eliminate the Dalki to minimise the losses. Maybe I can continue to level up from them!' Quinn questioned since he had levelled up another time since he had fought all those before, currently bringing his level up to 69.

In his mind, even if he lost the stats, there was a good chance that at level 70, Quinn could evolve, which would make up for the loss, but even then, there was no guarantee.

'No, my solution is, let me fight." Said Vincent. "My solution is to let me use your body and head to the Cursed faction. You can use the Dalki strength and control two at the same time. Even if you run into tough ones, you can face them, and if needed, borrow energy and continue to take down the ships.

'If you need to use your original body, I can always come back here, thanks to Wevil and Linda. I will fight in your place, Quinn and help out those in the Cursed faction as much as possible.'

This was a solution Quinn hadn't thought of. For so long, he had been fighting by himself, and even when he had others, there was no one other than Sil that was currently at the level where they could help. There were times where Quinn wished he could clone himself, and perhaps this was the closest situation to it.

In the end, the risk involved in this situation was lowered. If Vincent couldn't take on Hilston he could at least help all the others on the Cursed ship. At the same time, if Quinn ran into another great foe in the Dalki, he could take some of his own energy from his body, and if he died, he would only be placed back in his original body.

'I can only control your body. If I could, I would take your place and be the Dalki taking down the motherships. This is the best way, and I promise I will try my best to save as many lives as possible. Quinn, trust me, I know how much the Cursed people mean to you, and I know how much you want to help everyone.'

Thinking about this, Quinn felt like he had no choice. The idea of the penalty was too strong.

'Vincent…do your best out there. If there's any trouble, then I will be back. I trust you…kinda.' Quinn said, thinking back to the strange girl he had seen before.

With that, Vincent was soon off in the shadow and was heading back to the Cursed ship. Quinn was now in control of the Dalki body they had just captured and had two more by his side.

Quinn and the two Dalki continued to travel together. What Quinn was finding strange was how little Dalki there were on this planet compared to all the others before. Even in the scout team he had met, there was only a few.

'Is there a type of dangerous beast on this planet that has been killing them? Or is it because they know the force on the Shelter is small, but they still sent a mothership, so that can't be the case.' Quinn wondered.

Eventually, Quinn could see the mothership up ahead that was floating at the base of what looked like an inactive volcano. The others that Quinn had seen had all been somewhat active. Either in smoke, eruptions or spewing out some substance of some kind, but this one was larger than the others and was doing pretty much nothing.

When he had reached the foot of the volcano, he had expected to see another camp of Dalki that was being established just as he had seen all the times before, but there was no such thing. Instead, in the distance, Quinn could only see a single Dalki standing there.

'What, where are all the Dalki? Did they stay onboard the ship?' Quinn thought, but something was strange. As Quinn got closer, he was expecting some sort of ambush, but there seemed to be no such thing. Hiss cautious nature was telling him something was up, because the strangest thing of them all, was the fact that the Dalki that stood there on its own, was wearing clothes of all things.

# Chapter 1219 Crash Landing

While Vincent was in Quinn's body, using the shadow abilities still felt very foreign to him. He could use the blood skills in Quinn's body without having to rely on the system because he had used these skills and the same moves in his body a long time ago, again and again.

At the same time, Quinn's body, due to it having evolved into the Vampire lord stage, wasn't actually all that different to what Vincent had in the past. But the shadow abilities were a different matter altogether. To use them, Vincent had to access the system. When using the shadow link skill, it gave him a few options of people he could connect to that also had their shadow link on.

'There are a couple on the Cursed ship that have the Shadow ability, but the question is who should I go towards?' Vincent wondered. 'There was that strong blockhead fighter, Nate? No, in this situation there is a high chance he is still in the middle of combat. What I need to gather first is information. I have no clue what has happened on the Cursed ship nor why the fighting has prolonged for this long. The one I need to go to is Sam.'

After making his decision, Vincent soon found his body becoming a shadow itself. When his body was forming back to its solid state, he could see himself appearing in front of Sam, but the sight wasn't exactly what he thought it would be.

When seeing Sam, he looked partially injured. Blood was dripping from his head and was all over his clothes. That wasn't the shocking thing though, what was shocking about the situation was where they were currently. From staring out of the square window in the room, Vincent could see they were around three stories high in some type of building. The walls were made of a hard orange brick of some sort.

In the room itself, he wasn't alone. Layla and Nate were conscious but lying on the floor. It seemed like they were unable to move as they would constantly whine and groan in pain, and lastly, the two reporters Bonny and Void, were present as well.

"Quinn! You're here!" Bonny shouted as she was the first one to spot them. Void, who was by her side, quickly grabbed her and reminded her that she needed to be quiet, making a shushing sound. Sam, who was constantly peeping out of the large window, not seeing anything, smiled when he turned and saw who it was, but that smile quickly faded.

"Quinn, your back. I couldn't get in contact with you before, so I thought something serious had happened to you, but you look fine." Sam spoke quietly.

"What happened here? Why aren't you on the Cursed ship?" Vincent asked, thinking that the current situation was far more critical than telling his own story. Where were the rest of the Cursed members? Why were they on the planet? The last time they had watched the live stream, they could see that they were still on the ship. So much had clearly changed.

Glancing over to Void, Vincent could see that he was still working away, and it looked like the live stream was still being broadcasted.

Sam didn't say much at first. But he poked his head out of the window carefully again. Seeing how cautious his actions were, Vincent was doing the same. Also, with his careful hearing, he could hear that there was still fighting going on in, but it was a distance away.

"If you look out far enough, I think you will be able to spot it. That's the Cursed ship over there." Sam pointed.

Looking out the window, Vincent could see that the cursed ship was stuck in the sand. It didn't look like it had received the best of landings as pieces were handing off. Now he realised that they were on a planet.

"It's quite a story, I don't know if you know, but the Blade family attacked us, and they didn't come alone, but they had also unleashed all the captives they held on us as well. But where things started to change was when the Dalki arrived. I'll catch you up as much as I can…"

———

When the attacks from the Blade family ship had stopped. It gave Logan more time to figure out the situation on the ship. He was using his spiders and the cameras onboard to see everything that was going on, but what also turned out to be a good source of information for himself was the live stream that was coming from Void.

Although Logan could see everything, he had to remain where he was in the command centre for a few reasons. He was using his soul weapon to repair any structures that were needed on the ship. With the most powerful ability users fighting against each other, there were sure to be holes here and there that would lead to severe problems if left unattended.

As quickly as they were being made, he was fixing them, but he couldn't do that forever. At the same time, he kept the fighting on the ship to certain areas. Opening and closing off certain areas, making it so all of those would choose to go a certain way around the ship, but there were a few people he couldn't control, and that was the Blade family themselves.

'If they start fighting with their full strength, I don't think my MC cells can keep up. I have to do something.'

Using his calculations, Logan ultimately made a choice to head towards Planet Caladi. The desert planet that was closest. The only thing was while he was on his way there, he had run into a certain Dalki mothership hovering nearby, and they didn't exactly look like they were just going to let them land.

In a quick split decision, seeing the chaos and struggle everyone was facing and hoping to cause even less harm, Logan allowed them to purposely board the ship. It was a risk, but he had hoped that the fighting that was happening between humans at the moment would soon be concentrated on the third enemy that was coming towards them, the only thing he didn't calculate was just who would be coming onboard the ship, and that was a five spiked Dalki.

They had yet to run into one, so why of all things was there one in a place like so next to a planet like so. The only thing he could think was that the Cursed faction was genuinely cursed.

The fighting between the Dalki and Hilston was already causing trouble for Logan. All of the training rooms were reinforced, but with two titans, the damage and attacks were unable to be contained, and as the fight went on, they both started to use more of their strength. If they continued to fight then, Logan could see half of the ship disappearing and all of them dying on the spot.

'I got reports that the teleporters on the ship aren't working anymore, ever since the Dalki came on board. Only a few people managed to use them to escape in time. Damn it, we need to get there quicker!'

Heading towards the planet, Logan knew he would have to put more energy into the thrusters and break through the atmosphere. Calculating it with the planet's gravity pulling them in, it was going to be a rough landing for all of them.

[Everyone, this is Logan. Brace for impact, we are approaching planet Caladi at an incredible speed. We will Crash!]

The message ended there, and it didn't take long for everyone on board the ship to feel just what was happening. Logan could see the giant ship heading straight towards a sandy desert not too far away from the Shelter.

He was doing his best to slow it down, changing the ship's shape using his ability to make it more wind resistant. Parts of the ship were breaking off and flying, the front was getting incredibly hot, but he knew they all needed to pull through.

Lifting the ship up at the right moment, the large Cursed ship started to skim across the sand. Crashing and bouncing more than once. Waves of sand were chucked up in the sky each time, everywhere, and the sudden impact sent those that were fighting inside off their feet.

Even Logan himself was unable to keep his hands on the command centre. When it finally stopped, Logan pulled himself up. He noticed that the ship was still in good condition. They would still be able to fly. With a few weeks of work, they could get it back into top shape in no time, bringing it back to what it originally was.

'There's one thing I need to do.' Logan thought, placing his hands on the command console one last time. All of the exits for a crash landing in such a situation like this one were now opening. Parts of the outer layer of the armour were ejected from the main ship, and several exits were seen all over. Allowing for everyone inside to exit from the ship.

There were around a 1000 Cursed members aboard. The ship could hold more, but some had already left, and there were those that had left when the Cursed revealed themselves as V.

Immediately, people started to leave the Cursed ship, but they weren't the only thing that were leaving. As Dalki could be seen continuing to fight, not taking a break.

A few seconds later, and a large explosion was heard coming from the centre of the ship, and in the air, Hilston could be seen having been grabbed by a Dalki with its feet by his shoulders and was thrown far off into the sand.

Exiting out of the Cursed ship as well, Sam was trying to act as quickly as possible. Many of the chained were in combat with the Dalki, but his priority was not getting rid of the Dalki, but getting everyone to a safe place. With the Shelter nearby, he just wanted all of the others to get away from the fighting that was about to occur. So he had made that his target. Telling everyone to go towards the Shelter while letting the Chained fight the Dalki.

———

Back in the room, Sam had just gotten to this part of the story.

"I know it might have been wrong to abandon the others, but I needed to look out for the Cursed faction most of all. Still, all of this was my mistake. I should have remembered that planet Caladi was one of the first planets evacuated by the Earthborn group. When everyone arrived at the Shelter, it had already been taken over by a group of Dalki. The fight wasn't over even for us."
