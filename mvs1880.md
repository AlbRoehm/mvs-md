# Chapter ﻿1880 The red heart's use

The single moment, for Layla, felt like an eternity. It was long-awaited, and she didn't want it to end. It wasn't just the kiss with the love of her life but the first kiss she had ever received as well.

When growing up, she had only focused on Pure. After that, the events of the world continued to transpire one by one, and the entire time she just couldn't be herself, she couldn't settle down with the man she loved, but that was perhaps because the man she loved would go on to become the hero of the entire world and save it from unimaginably powerful enemies.

In the end though, the kiss had to end there as Quinn pulled away and held her by her shoulders. Her horns now remained a bright red, and she couldn't stop looking at Quinn's eyes and his lips again.

All of the girls watching by the side, who at some point had some type of feeling towards Quinn, thought they would feel jealous of this, but for some reason, they didn't.

The moment was so sweet, the aura around the two showed how they were made for each other, and after hearing the story and seeing them pour their feelings for each other, none of them felt like they deserved to be with Quinn. In the end, the one who had always loved Quinn, and always been by his side through all this time, would stand by his side, hand in hand.

"I owed you that for a long time." Quinn eventually said. "I wanted to do that a long time ago."

What Quinn meant by this was the strange connection that stopped the two from kissing each other in the past. There was a time when the two of them had made their feelings clear, but the special bond between vampire and familiar made things complicated, and they could never take the next step.

However, Quinn did have a theory and idea as to what would happen. He was hoping that now he was a Celestial Vampire, that his body wasn't completely the same. Quinn was essentially his own race. ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ꜰʀᴏᴍ ꜰʀᴇᴇᴡ(ᴇʙɴᴏ)ᴠᴇʟ. ᴄᴏᴍ.

Something that could even create new subclasses. He no longer followed the vampire rules, he was now on the same or a similar level as the ones who had created the vampires, so it made no sense to still be restricted.

Hearing Quinn's words, Layla didn't really know what to say. In truth, she would love to spend a day or an entire week with just the two of them so they could just experience life together, talk and catch up about everything each one of them had done, but as always, there were important matters at hand.

Even now, there was something she had to do, and Quinn was going to be busy as well.

"Sorry to ruin the sweet moment." Logan's words interrupted her thought, "However, there are some matters that we need to talk about. Once this is all done, don't worry, I will create a special event for you, and we will have the most spectacular weddings the world has ever witnessed!"

"Wedding?!" Layla said, stepping back a bit. "Isn't it too soon for that?"

"What are you talking about?" Peter replied. "You confessed your feelings a thousand years ago, and you guys kissed after a thousand years, don't tell me we have to wait another thousand years for the two of you to get married. Anyway, as long as I am the best man, I don't really mind it. I have known the two of you for a while, and you know Vorden doesn't deserve it. I mean, he isn't even here right now."

Layla's heart was racing. She had never even thought about these things because she never imagined she would even be in this situation in the first place. Her mind was getting flustered. Too many things flashed in her mind at once, which made her think of essentially nothing.

"We need to get to the point of what to do next." Logan continued. "Right now, we know that Pure has the Red Heart. According to Chris, Erin has given it over Zero, and this is a serious problem.

"At the Pure's base, I learned what they were planning to do with the Red Heart, and I think Quinn, you were on the right track. The power of the red heart has enough energy to open up a portal."

"A portal? That's it? I open those things up all the time." Sil was surprised and moved his finger to open up another one.

"Well, this portal is vastly different. From their research, they have been trying to open up a portal to another plain. This will be hard to describe to you all, but it's essentially like another universe that is like this one.

"There are multiple theories, but no one has ever actually managed to achieve such a thing. As for why they are planning to do this, in the files, it's stated they want to meet God."

It was then that everything clicked in Quinn's head. When talking to the Celestials and Bliss, he had heard several things as well and learned from Chris what Zero truly wanted to do.

"That has to be it!" Quinn said. "The deal that Zero made. Zero talked about bringing people from the dead back to life. A long time ago, Richard Eno talked about opening up a portal to this other place, and that was how the vampires came into existence in the first place. The deal, it must be for Zero to open up that portal again."

Logan nodded, and those that had been with Quinn from the beginning followed, while the others were confused. They had no idea who Richard Eno was. Unfortunately, it was a name that was lost in time and replaced by Quinn's fame.

"If a portal is opened up to that place again, then something more dangerous could happen than just vampires roaming the streets. The information I got from Eno stated that there are several different gods on that plain as well.

"It would be like opening up a portal to hell in the world."

Grinding his teeth, Quinn felt partly responsible because he was the one that created the Red heart in the first place. It was because of him that this whole thing could even be possible in the first place.

"Wait, Erin is with Zero?" Layla asked, not having been caught up on everything.

Once again, there was a brief overview of everything going on for them to catch up on what had happened. Logan even explained a bit about how vampires had come into existence in the first place.

This revelation blew the others' minds. This was something that Muka didn't know either. She just thought vampires were mutations of humans or an evolution path that got separated from the latter at one point and took a whole different trajectory.

"I know the area where Zero perhaps would venture into," Chris stated. "But I don't know the exact location or planet. Right now, along with him, there's Agent Four, who has the blood armour, and Erin, along with Flora, who holds the vampire's great sword."

When put like that, and after hearing everything that they had done so far, none of the opponents sounded like they were easy to deal with.

"Quinn," Layla said. "I know what you wanted to ask me. I can see it on your face. I agree that Erin needs to be dealt with. It's clear that something is up, but if we leave her as she is, she will just continue to grow stronger. Even with our power right now, there is no way for us to find out the truth. I was too weak to stop her."

Saying these words, Layla grasped the black sword's hilt.

Quinn was happy that he didn't need to worry about what Layla would think of him if he was to deal with Erin because in his mind right now, it was something that he might have to do to end it all against her.

"I don't want you to come with us." Quinn replied, "You have already tried to talk Erin out of it, but it didn't get through her head and turned out to be useless. You just being there would do nothing. If I'm honest, it might even be a distraction for me."

It sounded harsh, but Layla knew those words were right. She had already tried her best and failed.

"However, there is a chance that while we are away and searching for Erin and Zero, we may not find them because they might attack you again. That sword." Quinn said while pointing his finger at it. "I checked it before, and it seemed alright, but the marking, it's the same marking that was on Laxmus's head that time.

"The two of you seem to be getting the same energy from the same God. I think it's a bit dangerous, so let me do something."

Layla pulled the sword out of its sheath. The sword had been a great companion for her this entire time, and she knew she wouldn't have survived so long without it. However, she wouldn't say no to Quinn and handed the sword over to him.

And it was then that a system message popped up in front of Quinn.

[The sword has been sealed with the Soul of a Godslayer]

[Would you like to attempt to break the seal?]

*****

# Chapter ﻿1881 An old one

Reading the system prompt in front of him, Quinn was trying to figure out what exactly was going on. At first, he thought the sword was just a regular celestial weapon. In truth, Quinn wanted to test his own Celestial weapons that he could create against this sword, and he now had enough points to do so.

The only thing was that he wanted to try to create celestial weapons from scratch, and to do that, he needed the best forger that he knew. Still, with the sword in front of him, he thought it might be a win-win situation.

Either its powers would increase or decrease depending on what he did, and in doing so, Layla would be a lot safer using the sword. But that was if he could even change the marking on the weapon in the first place, since now that this message had appeared, he was uncertain if he should go through with it.

'Is there the power of a God Slayer in this sword? The power that Layla draws from the weapon is not just celestial power? I guess that would explain why it is so powerful, but then, what happens if I break the seal?'

To break the seal, Quinn felt like it meant realising the power from the inside of the weapon, and if that was the case, it would no longer be special.

'Hey you, I saw everything. You and that girl, both of you are together, right?!' A voice resounded in Quinn's head.

He turned his head left and right for a few seconds but soon released that it was coming from the sword itself.

'Who would have thought that she would know someone like you? I can't believe it. The second you touched my sword, I could tell that you have the same type of energy. You can…break me out of here, right?' The man in the sword's voice was almost trembling near the end.

Quinn didn't know the weather either. To tell him the truth or not, but hearing the sound of the man's voice inside, Quinn could tell the man trapped within the sword was in an incredibly sorry state. At the same time, Quinn wasn't foreign to the idea of things being trapped.

Vincent was originally part of the system as well. So why couldn't one be placed inside a sword? It also reminded Quinn that Vincent believed when he was placed inside the system, his power of equivalent exchange had entered it as well, which was why Quinn got such great rewards dependent on the tasks that were given. Perhaps it was the same here?

'Even if I can break the seal, I don't have the ability to remove you from the sword.' Quinn clarified.

The sword turned silent upon hearing this. It knew that its body had long disappeared from this world.

'That damned God of Death tricked me!' The sword shouted. 'Pulling me down and such.'

Hearing this, Quinn could only assume that the sword was talking about the same god that Laxmus was under, the god who had created the original vampires in the first place.

'What happened?'

'….You know what…I kind of have forgotten. It's been so long. I just remember that he tricked me, and that's how I ended up here. Then I was flung around all over the place. I just remember…my past was extremely difficult and sad.

'Whenever someone usually grabs me, I can't help it, but if they take any of my power, they take part of my pain. But Layla, she was able to handle it, she was used to the motions and pressure of using my powers put on her, but many people have gone mad before. I'm guessing it's not affecting you because you're a God as well!' The sword began to plead, 'So please, if you can find a way to release me, break this seal and give me a body, I promise I will do everything in my power to help you.

'Once you have done everything you have done. Then I…want to remember everything that happened, and I'll face that damned god himself.'

Although this was a weapon created by a possible enemy, Quinn was surprised to find the sword actually had a true hatred for the said god, even if it couldn't remember why that was.

'I might have a way to get you out of that sword, but unfortunately, I think it might be better that you stay in there. You see, the person you were protecting is someone I care about, and I hope you can continue to protect her.

'However, I am a fair person. I will break the seal from you to prove I will help you as long as you continue to give your power to Layla as she needs it. When that is all done, I will ask someone to move you.'

Quinn said, glancing at Sil, who was visually confused because Quinn had been holding the sword for a while now without saying or doing anything, but everyone just stayed quiet, thinking he was focused on something.

'I have already been in this sword for longer than I can remember.' The sword replied. 'If I have to continue for a little while longer with the hope of breaking free, then I will do as you wish.'

Hearing this, Quinn turned his attention toward the system. In the next instant, energy began to flow out of Quinn. His hair was floating on its ends, and everyone could feel a strange energy that surrounded him.

'I can feel my celestial energy being drained into the weapon!'

[-1234 Celestial energy]

[-1825 Celestial Energy]

Thankfully, Quinn had obtained a large amount of Celestial energy for defeating Athos, and he was sure that whoever had put this marking on wouldn't have placed a ridiculous amount on a weapon…at least he hoped.

Soon, dark black sparks were shooting all over the sword. They continued to spread out, hitting the ground and getting larger and larger. The others decided to step away as they saw this.

"Quinn!" Layla shouted out, worried that something was happening.

[-23,637 Celestial points]

'So he did use a lot more Celestial points than I thought to create this weapon. Just who is this God?'

Eventually, the black sparks started to fade, and the energy from Quinn was slowly starting to disperse as well. When turning the sword around on its hilt, Quinn noticed the marking had disappeared.

'You did it, I can tell. I can feel that I'm freer!' The sword said, 'Thank you so much, kind stranger.'

'Don't thank me just yet. I need to make sure that Layla has the same power as before.'

Quinn had thought about using his celestial energy on Layla. However, after meeting the other Celestials and travelling in the universe, he changed his view slightly on things. Giving celestial energy to those close to him would make them a target.

Maybe not now when they didn't have to worry about these things, but if Quinn made an enemy, if he hadn't already, then there would be those that would be coming for him, and they would target his dedicated followers first.

It was just too risky for him. After hearing about the sword and how much power it gave Layla, he realised there was another way he could help them: by sharing his powers with others with weapons.

The only downside was that if the person were to die, then anyone could get their hands on these weapons and use them how they weren't intended, which was somewhat what had happened to the sword in the first place.

'Wait, so you broke the seal but are now just going to put your own on me!' The sword sounded upset.

'I don't break my promises. As I said, I need you to be strong enough to protect her.'

[Would you like to mark the God Slayer Sword?]

'That's quite a good ring to it. Let's make a sword that's actually capable of slaying those damned Gods.' Quinn thought.

'Yes, mark the sword.'

*****

# Chapter 1882 Crystal red wings

The energy from Quinn was clearly being expended outward again. HIs hair started to float, and everyone took a step back once more. However, rather than a sinister dark energy that they had felt from before, instead this energy was more familiar to most of them.

It felt somewhat like the vampire aura they were all used to, only slightly different compared to that. This time it didn't take long, and where the markings of the single eye with two wings were, it was replaced with a red dragon head in front of a black shield with crossed chains.

'The celestial energy right now isn't so much of a use to me, and on top of that, Layla needs to stay safe.' Quinn thought. 'You did a good job, you were able to take quite a bit of celestial energy. Maybe it's because you were at the level of a god slayer?'

[-50,000 Celistal points]

With breaking the seal, giving Geo, the others and Ceril a load of his Celestial points, he had made quite a dent in the amount he had.

[162,256/285,462 Celestial energy]

Still, it was large enough for him to attempt to do more things, to create more weapons and still enough for him to fight most of the celestials. In a way, spreading out his celestial energy like so, was giving more people a way to fight against these beings that were known as gods.

"The sword is complete, I have placed my own energy into the sword. I'm not sure if it will have the same effects as it did before, or if it will be stronger but I'm sure it will come in useful."

Layla accepted the sword from Quinn with both hands. Although the two of them had just shared an intimate moment, she still wanted to show respect and thankfulness for what Quinn had done.

When taking the sword, there was a surprised look on her face.

"He's… still inside." Layla smiled.

"The two of us, made a deal." Quinn winked.

The others had no clue what they were talking about, and at the same time he believed that they didn't need to know.

"I hope that weapon does you well. Honestly, I wish I had my own weapon to use as well." Quinn commented.

Although his soul weapon allowed him to form it into whatever shape he wanted. He knew the power and strength of things such as Demon tier weapons. His soul weapon in the first place both of them were on limited time scales whereas a normal weapon was not.

It gave versatility to fighting and also helped when fighting multiple opponents.

"It would be good, if Alex was here. I would have liked to have tested something with him."

Hearing that, Logan had a smile on his face as he came over.

"Actually there was something in the story that we didn't mention. When Laxmus was defeated, a strange looking… coffin-like structure had come out."

Logan led the way, and the rest followed him to his lab, it was here that Quinn had also caught a glimpse of Vincent and what state he was in. Based on the machine next to him, one could see that he was at least still alive.

"This here, we believe that Alex is inside. Unfortunately I gave you the blood solution to open it. Do you still have it?" Logan asked.

It took a second for Quinn to realize what Logan was saying, but he soon released that they believed Alex was the one that was in the chamber coffin.

"You… actually found him." Quinn stated.

Memories of when Quinn and Alex first met were flashing in his head. The system helped him pick out a talented forger, and before Quinn had truly made a name for himself the two of them had decided to work together.

Together they were going to grow his name, and although his items were sold quite wide and far, in the end he had never created a name for himself, apart from those on the Cursed faction that had also now disappeared.

"So this Alex he was a forger for the Cursed faction?" Jessica asked.

"Yes, he was the forger that created many weapons that were used in the battle against the Dalki." Quinn stated. "On top of that though, he was a dear friend."

Walking up to the chamber Quinn's arm was covered in shadow, adn soon the little vile of blood was in his hands. As he walked up to where the circular lock was, where the blood needed to be dripped, he hesitated for a second.

'Why… am I so worried?' Quinn thought.

Thinking about this, images of Fex started to come into his mind. When Quinn had woken him up, how frail and weak he looked, how tired he was. That feeling of first waking up in this new world and seeing that… it was a feeling that hadn't gotten out of his mind this entire time.

'What if, I wake up Alex and he's like that as well.' Quinn thought.

Either way, he couldn't be afraid anymore, and decided to pour the vile of blood on the mechanism. Slowly it started to drop and fill up in the circle. It lit up a light red before starting to spin and unlock in certain ways.

This hadn't happened before when the other blood was spilt on it, which made it clear that this was Alex Way the blood fairy. A final click was heard and the door swivelled open. A few seconds later and a hand could be seen holding onto the side of the round casket.

"Why… do I feel so strange?" A voice was heard.

Eventually the group could see, a sat up body, the top half of the said person was there, and for the girls there eyes were memorized by the sight in front of them. Unaware, when the blood had awoken Alex, it had caused his natural blood red wings to snap open.

The clear red almost crystal like colour was incredibly beautiful to them all.

"It's so pretty!" Minny said pointing.

Hearing these words, Alex turned his head to look at a group of mostly strangers.

"Where is this place, what happened?" Alex said as he continued to rub his eyes.

They were quite blurry due to the amount of time he had taken to wake up.

"We decided to wake you up." a voice said. "I heard what you went through and I'm sorry I wasn't there to protect you. Because I was the one that turned you into this, people were after your blood, yet I was nowhere to be seen.

"I have to take accountability for what I did."

The voice Alex heard had sent shivers running down his spine. It was a voice that he would never forget. All those years after he had gone away, Alex hadn't forgotten about him. The will of the Cursed faction was to do as Quinn wished and it was why Alex had tried so hard to complete his job as a forger for the Cursed faction.

Continuing to make weapons that would help them out in their battles. At the end of the day, Alex also blamed himself for not being able to create weapons good enough to help the Cursed faction combat the enemies that they had made.

"Quinn!" Alex shouted, his wings flapping in excitement so fast that he was now hovering in the air. Everyone could now see him in the room above. "It's really you, it's really you!"

Alex then flew at a great speed straight towards Quinn, and landed right in front of him. His wings were still flailing about but he was on the ground.

"I can't believe it, Quinn you were alive, you finally woke up… do you know what happened, to Fex, to the others… it was so hard."

Looking at Alex carefully, Quinn could see his hands, they were cut and burned all over, and at the same time he had wounds over his body that looked like they hadn't healed either.

'Was Alex also involved in fighting as well… how did this happen to him?' Quinn thought clenching his fist.

The good news was though, that Alex looked just as good as Quinn had last seen him. It appeared as if he hadn't aged too much. Logan did state that Alex had been placed in slumber early on due to those that were after him, but it looked like it had happened a little too late before he had gotten involved.

"I'm guessing you have woken me up because you require my skills." Alex asked, pumping his fist. "Well tell me what you need boss, and I'll make the best weapon in the world for you."

Quinn smiled at this comment.

"I'm going to need a better weapon than that. I'm going to need something that can take on the whole universe." Quinn replied.

****


# Chapter ﻿1883 Make me the best (Part 1)

Once again, since there was a new person in the group that had slept for a long time, they needed to be caught up on everything. Thankfully, Logan had a solution where it wasn't necessarily needed for them all to talk together again.

For a case like this, he had recorded their conversation from earlier, and at the moment, Alex was watching all of it. At the same time, he had asked for a pad and paper, that way he could write down notes of what had occurred while he was in a deep sleep.

[Quest complete]

[Find and wake up the Blood fairy Alex Way]

[+ 10,000 Celestial points]

Quinn had almost forgotten about this quest he had received a while ago, and in truth, he didn't really see it as a quest because it was something that he just wanted to do. Still, he wouldn't complain about getting these rewards especially since he had plans to use more of his celestial energy.

[New quest received]

[Get Forger 'Alex Way' to create a weapon using a god slayer crystal]

'A godslayer crystal, like the crystal the shadow came from... but do all god slayers drop crystals? Or is it only beasts that are deemed to be at the level of a god slayer that drop crystals? Either way, this new type of crystal could change everything... but I don't have the time to go looking for god slayers right now.'

It made Quin wonder as well, if the weapon Layla used was then classified as a god slayer weapon. Although it seemed more so like a god slayer's soul had been into the weapon along with its power, it did contain one of the strongest abilities Quinn knew.

The power to negate anything it touched, it was part of the reason why they were able to defeat the demon tier dragon in the first place.

"I think it would be best if I was to go," Layla stated while everyone was waiting around. "Sil, thank you for bringing me to Quinn. I mean it. It's been a long time and this meeting is something that I will never be able to forget."

Saying those words, her horns started to light up slightly red in the process.

"However, I know Quinn is busy, and the Red Vampires won't be safe until Erin is dealt with. Which is why I need to return to them.

"Sil, if possible, would you be able to take me back?"

Sil nooded, and before Layla was to return to the red vampires, she had walked up to Quinn.

"Whatever happens to Erin, I believe you will make the right decision about what to do, Quinn. I know you have a good heart and I know you would have tried your best. Just don't get yourself killed, because, at the end of the day, you are the most important person to me."

With that, she went and hugged Quinn tightly, and he had done the same to her.

"When this is over, I will come and visit you and I'm telling you now, I don't plan for this to take a long time."

With that said, Sil opened up a portal returning Layla to where she had come from and for himself to return shortly after. It was only around 30 minutes later that Alex was finally done catching up with everything.

"I can't believe all of that stuff happened. Quinn, I really can't imagine how it is to live a life in your shoes," Alex stated, moving his arms up and down. "Honestly, the two of us were close to each other in age, and although a lot has happened to me, it's nowhere near on the level as what is happening to you."

Shaking his head, Alex tried to get himself out of that mood, and his wings started to quickly flap about again.

"Anyway, I will create whatever you want, do you have anything in mind?" Alex asked.

As soon as Alex said that Quinn opened up his shadow and on the floor several items started to appear. First, there was the destroyed Blue Fang set.

"This was destroyed in a fight, and if we can, I would like to have it repaired," Quinn asked in a pained voice, and Chris, the person who had destroyed it, was looking away. "When repairing it, or with the new set of items I want to try two things.

"I have the ability to mark weapons and give them power, that is, after they have been made. Just like I did with Layla's weapon. I would like to mark the weapons after that, but during the repair and making process I want you to use part of my blood to make the weapons as well."

When Quinn extracted the blood from his body, it was the easiest way for him to use his celestial energy in the form of a power that would work on not just celestials, but others as well.

On top of that, Quinn was hoping for something else as well. Although hardening his own blood and creating a blood armour did help him, it was an alternative to his normal armour, due to his normal armour disintegrating when using celestial blood energy.

The problem was, he would also lose HP points when using his blood in this way leaving him less to use offensively. Hopefully, using his blood to create the weapons would stop, or at least lessen, his own energy causing the weapons and armour to disintegrate.

"I can see what I can do. I got used to mixing my own blood in with items so it should be okay. The only thing is, to repair a demon tier level of equipment I would need another demon tier crystal, to begin with." Alex explained. "It's why most people don't bother going through with repairs since they would rather use the crystal to make something else. Are you sure you want to do this?"

"I'm sure, this armour means a lot to me." Quinn replied instantly. Although he now had set his heart on someone else, there was still someone that he could never forget. This armour was his last link to her.

Quinn also wanted to put a marking on his demon tier chest piece, although the effects of the demon tier were nice and it didn't take up MC points for each attack he blocked.

With the current enemies he was facing, they were either faster than he could use his wings, or he would have to use shadow overload anyway to block the attacks, therefore eating into his MC.

There was a big risk, when marking an item or a weapon, that it would lose its active skills, but Quinn also was betting on the fact that it might become something that was more useful to him as well.

"I... also want a demon tier weapon as well." Quinn requested. "Made in the same way as the armour. I know you're limited to what the crystal can be used for but I also know that you will do a good job."

There was adrenaline running through Alex already, he had only just woken up, and he was being told to make universe changing items. There was no forger in the entire universe that he felt was more lucky than him in the current situation they were in.

"So um... I can do all this, but I am going to need some crystals."

In total, they would need at least two demon tier crystals for the items to be made, but at the same time, they wanted to go searching for Zero and Erin.

"Let me do the searching." Chris said. "I know the areas where Zero will be. I won't engage with him. I'm not foolish enough to think that I can do this without you. When I know where he is, I'll contact you straight away.

"In the meantime, you concentrate on getting what you need for those weapons. You're going to need them." Chris said.

After fighting with Chris and knowing his strength, it did make Quinn wonder just how strong was Zero?

"Maybe we don't have to wait long." Logan smiled. "That energetic son of mine, has already been out hunting."

****

# Chapter ﻿1884 Make me the best (Part 2)

The group turned to Logan wondering what he meant and he soon to explained.

"My son, Jake Green. While all of you were busy on the Pure ship causing mayhem and a ruckus, I sent him off to gather a few Demon tier crystals." Logan explained. "It felt like a large battle was soon coming, a fight with Pure."

"What I didn't expect was for us to suddenly attack them before they even got the chance to attack us. I also thought Pure would stay quiet for a while, so it was the best chance for us to gather extra power."

"Jake is strong enough to fight Demon tier beasts on his own. Originally they were going to be used as weapons and handed out to our best, or you guys, but now they have a better use." Logan smiled.

They didn't know how long Jake would take, but it was a head start. With Logan's demon tier tracking device as well, as long as there was no trouble in killing the beasts, all would be well.

"Even if I do get all the materials, it will probably take me around a week or so to make the weapon for you. You will have to wait either way." Alex explained.

In this situation, Quinn felt a bit restless, because there was nothing he could do to speed up the process, everyone in the team was already moving.

"I still think it would be best if we search for Zero ahead of time, I doubt there would be much he could do in a week's time, but we can never be too sure," Chris explained.

"I think it's a good idea." Logan replied. "However, I think you should take someone with you. I think Peter would be a good choice. With the two of you, your strength will help even if you do happen to run into a fight with them.

"In the meantime, Quinn will wait for the weapon to be done. I would say to take a teleporter with you. However, I doubt it will have any effect with Agent 4 there as well. The only thing we can do is, once the weapons are complete, have Quinn come out to you as fast as possible."

Quinn didn't want to be split up from the group again. Not this time, but he was wondering if there was anything else. Alex knew the shadow so Quinn could get to him at any point and time, but getting to the others was harder.

The only forging equipment that was good enough for Alex to work on was in Green city as well, and Sil's teleport powers didn't work that far.

"I guess it's the only thing that could be done, but I would feel a lot safer if Sil was there as well," Quinn asked.

"What do you think? I'm not strong enough!" Peter shouted. "I kicked that Flora girl's arse already and I will slap Erin back to herself or to death if I meet her."

"I think you should trust Peter on this one," Sil said. "Everyone here has managed to survive without you Quinn, they went against Erin and survived. I honestly wouldn't worry about them.

"For me, the bigger threat is out there. I took some time off to help you Quinn, but I need to go back out there. I forgot a lot of what I saw before, but all these events happening now are making it come back to me. I can tell, it's soon."

Sil didn't want to worry the others with what he had seen with his vision, and after seeing Quinn's power there was no worry in his head that they would be fine without him.

"Sil, you have a really important task… Everyone does. I think you should stick to your guns on this one."

After a lot of talking between the group, it seemed like many of them were ready to finally leave. Now knowing that Quinn was okay.

Lucia was worried about the state of the Graylash family. She wanted to head back and see how the vampires were doing there. She felt like she had already accomplished a lot and was no fool. She knew that with the next fights against Erin, Zero, Flora and Agent 4 she could do nothing.

Jessica had also decided to go ahead with her. With the dhampirs mostly destroyed and no longer feeling under threat, now she could enjoy her life as a Traveller which was something she always wanted to do. On top of that, she knew there was no longer a reason for her to stay by Quinn's side anymore.

Then there was also Muka, she still had no clue what had happened to the rest of the vampire chambers. According to Chris, they knew nothing about them, so it was unlikely that her answer was with Pure or the others so she needed to find out her own answers.

This left Ceril, Minny and Mitchell. There were quite a few conversations between them all as they said their goodbyes. Minny was crying her eyes out for losing her beautiful aunties, and asked them to come see her from time to time.

As well, everyone thanked Quinn. Not just for what he did now, but also for what he did back then in the Dalki war as well. They had learnt that Quinn had never been able to get the pleasure of being thanked like that, so they wanted to make it up to him.

Sil said he would help each of them by teleporting them to where they wanted to be, before he went off to do his own thing and now the place suddenly seemed a lot quieter than it usually did.

"It's… been a rollercoaster of emotions, hasn't it Minny." Quinn said, sitting down and patting her head until she fell asleep on his lap.

Putting her to the side, Quinn gently placed her down allowing her to continue to sleep, and decided to head to a particular area along with Logan.

While waiting for the crystals and weapons to come, Quinn was going to use his own Celestial space to train again, getting as many hours in as he possibly could. There was a chance that he would have to take all four of them on.

With the weapons they had, even for him, Quinn could imagine it being a tough fight. All of these individuals were at the same level as Chris, or possibly higher. Meaning it would feel like taking on four god slayers at once.

Before that though, Quinn needed to see someone. Heading over to the large clear glass tube Quinn could see Vincent lying inside. His body was breathing but he seemed unconscious.

The nest crystal was in his chest and the energy was flowing through him slowly.

"Can you ask Jake to find a Nest crystal as well while he is out."

"Sure," Logan replied. "I mean, we are always looking for Nest crystals all the time anyway due to their use. Is there a reason?"

Quinn placed his hand on the glass chamber and now that he was closer he could feel the energy slowly entering Vincent's body. He was weak, like someone else he knew.

"A nest crystal's energy is almost limitless. I guess the correct thing to say is the energy is always restoring itself in the crystal. Which is why it can create so many beasts. However, if all of the energy is used up at once it will disappear."

Quinn had a lot of experience with Nest crystals along with Sil, and during that time it made him wonder.

"Vincent is weak like him… there is someone else that deserves to be on this journey. This journey to take out Erin, with my celestial powers and a nest crystal I want to see… I want to see if I can bring him along with me." Quinn explained.

"Who are you talking about?" Logan asked.

"My Blood Brother," Quinn replied.

# Chapter ﻿1885 A father figure

"Let me try something on Vincent," Quinn thought of something.

Before testing his new idea on Fex, he wanted to try it on Vincent first. The two situations were quite different yet similar simultaneously, and in the latter, Quinn felt like there was less risk.

The main reason behind this was that Vincent wasn't at the end of his life cycle due to the Nest Crystal in the first place. However, there was one thing that Quinn was unsure about. It was the fact that since Vincent's body was a clone of his in the first place, thus it was possible that the rules could differ.

"Quinn, are you sure about this?" Logan asked. "I know you can now do things beyond the realm of humanly possible, but the Nest crystals are also an unusual, unique power. You have to be careful regarding them, we don't know how they will react."

"I have been able to have a lot of experiences with the Nest Crystals, I think I can do this, and if it doesn't look like it will work, I'll stop immediately."

Hearing the response, Logan opened up the chamber, and Quinn placed his hand on the chest of the Nest Crystal. Then closing his eyes, he focused on the energies.

'First, I need to see how well the Nest Crystal energy is flowing into his body.' Quinn thought.

When just sending energy, Quinn felt a very faint red energy aura that was flowing around Vincent, and then there was the energy of the nest crystal which was going to all the cells in his body. On further observation, he found out the energy looked like little bolts of lighting were constantly hitting Vincent's cells, trying to reactivate them again.

The energy continued to be dispersed from the crystal, yet the cells weren't activating. In fact, it would take a hundred or so strikes to activate a single cell to flow and work again in Vincent's body.

'Is this the same as what was happening to me? Is that why it took so long for my body to recover as well? At this rate, Vincent won't wake up for another hundred years, just like me as well.

'The problem isn't the energy from the Nest crystal. If I force it to expend its energy through Vincent's body, it won't get him back to the way he was, and without the Nest Crystal, his body will fall apart.

'Which means maybe there is a way to activate the vampire cells in his body. Let's hope this works.'

The celestial energy began to draw out of Quinn, just like when he would create a dedicated follower. He had a theory and just hoped it would work. Slowly, he could feel his energy coming out of him, but it was doing nothing to the body in front of him.

'Come on, work!'

Then, when over a hundred celestial points had transferred, Quinn could see it even without the Nest crystal's help, the red cells would begin to move and come back to life.

The figures on the computer screen next to Vincent were starting to change.

"You can now accomplish things beyond science." Logan smiled. "I guess you really are a God."

After around three hundred points of celestial energy, Quinn could feel that Vincent's whole body was finally back to its initial state. When he cut off the energy transfer on that range, Quinn observed that the Nest Crystal continued to hit the cells, and the latter were responding with life.

After a while, Quinn concluded that the nest Crystal would not do its job of keeping Vincent alive like it's supposed to. When he stepped away, there was a bright glow around Vicent's chest. The strange device that Logan had attached to him was still there, and so was the wound, allowing one to see the crystal right through his body.

Suddenly, Vincent's eyes opened wide. They were entirely red, most likely due to the energy, but it soon started to fade out of him, and his eyes had gone back to normal. The first person he looked at was Quinn, who was in front of him.

"Kid…you did a good job," Vincent said, having somewhat understood what was going on around him, "It looks like all that time we waited for you didn't go wasted after all."

Quinn felt a lump in his throat when he tried to reply. For some reason, it was quite heartwarming for Quinn to reunite with the person in front of him.

"Your voice is so annoying." Quinn somehow managed to speak, "But for some reason, I missed being able to talk to you like in the past."

"Well, we can talk all we want now that you're alive, huh," Vincent said as he got up from the table and walked towards Quinn. The next moment, he went in and gave Quinn a big hug.

These two, in the end, were truly a family, they were relatives of each other, and Vincent had always felt like he had played a significant role in Quinn's life and also somewhat considered himself responsible for bringing hardships to the young kid.

——

After a while, all three of them began to chat and discuss what had happened so far. Seeing the large smile on Vincent's face, it seemed like everything was working out for Quinn, and thankfully, Laxmus, who had done this to him, was dealt with as well.

"I think my use when it comes to terms in fighting has come to an end," Vincent explained. "I had kept the Red heart and never appeared publicly because I knew there were powers out there, greater than mine, who could defeat me with a flick of their finger.

"I guess it is time for me to say that the new generation of powerhouses has surpassed me. But I will still do my best to help you. Maybe my skills are best here in the research lab working with Logan.

"I have been trying my best to research the Red Heart, but it proved difficult with me hiding it inside myself. If we get our hands on it, I can see what other uses we can have for it.

"Who knows, maybe we will be able to complete your wish with it, Quinn."

"My wish?" Quinn replied, not really able to recall he had any wishes other than to pay back a few people and protect the earth.

"Maybe we can use it to turn vampires back to humans. It would solve a lot of the problems currently. Those that are turned by others can have the life they wanted back. Vampires can live as they wish, and so can humans. Of course, this is a long shot, but as I said, I think it's best if I stay here."

After catching up, Quinn wished to get off. Now he had brought back Vincent, he could most likely bring back Fex as well. While waiting for Jake to bring the Demon tier Crystals and possible Next crystals, there was a certain someone that he would need to ask first if he could see Fex: the latter's blood relative.

"Is there any way you can get me in contact with Andy at the moment?" Quinn asked.

"Andy is currently not on earth," Logan explained. "The situation on Mars has become quite dire at the moment, so he and the Vampire crops have been busy. Do you remember the beast Horde you experienced when you first came here? Well, there have been a lot of them, and the level of the beast horde is rising slowly in many areas."

With everything going on, the beast horde was such a distant memory, but it was one of the changes that Quinn had experienced in this new world.

"Why are there even beasts in this solar system?" Quinn asked. "There are even beasts on Earth when there weren't before."

"There are a couple of reasons for that. One is that many people brought back the beasts for research. They created areas for travellers to use. Then the second was a meteor strike that happened around 800 years ago.

"It hit most of the planets in the solar system, and those meteorites had nest crystals on them. This caused an influx of beasts in all the areas. Of course, by then, we had colonised most of the planets in our solar system, so we have been at battle with beasts ever since. Although it's never been this bad."

"I guess I should head out then," Quinn replied. "I will see Andy and ask him about Fex, and maybe I can get a Nest Crystal myself. In the meantime, if Alex gets the materials needed, I can pop back to him using the shadow and give him my blood."

Soon Quinn would have Fex by his side once again.

# Chapter 1886 The lost power

Out in a distant solar system, away from that of the Graylash area, Earth, and all the known Beast Planets, a ship landed on one of the planets.

The universe was vast, with many different solar systems for any race to explore, and those originally from Earth had hardly touched the surface of their exploration.

Currently though, a new planet within a new solar system was being explored. The landmass of the planet was hard and made of a rock-solid black material, and running through it, in large streams all over the planet, was molten lava.

The red lava streams gave the planet a strange glow, and they were also reasons why the planet was hot, and there were also steam geezers. At the same time, volcanoes would erupt and explode at any moment, creating loud booms.

It wasn't the safest planet by any means, but the four people that were currently on it were no ordinary people either.

Erin and Flora walked side by side with their weapons placed away. Flora was standing on the outside, while Erin stood next to Zero, and Agent Four was on the far end. They walked in a single line as they explored the planet.

"We need to be cautious. According to our exploration team, this planet is full of mighty Demon tier beasts." Agent Four said as he stared at a strange tablet in his hand. It was strange how he was able to walk while looking down all the time. "Don't forget, we are here to gather the crystals to make new weapons for our upcoming battle."

A loud explosion was heard going off in the distance, and the ground below their feet began to rumble. Some of the lava that was in small streams, which were as wide as a car, had spilt over a little.

"How did you even find this place? And why are there so many dangerous beasts here?" Flora asked, moving her head around incredibly fast. Out of all of them there, she knew she was the weakest of them.

Sure she had a boost in strength due to her weapon, but it was hard to say whether or not a single weapon could improve one so much. However, she had been training non-stop with Erin, pushing herself to the very limit every day until now.

"It's hard to tell whether you are young or old when it comes to you Dhampirs." Agent Four commented without taking his face away from the screen. "Around Eight hundred years ago, there was a meteor strike that had entered Earth's solar system and struck several planets.

"Well, the theory is that the meteor strike had actually come from here when one of the planets exploded. Could you imagine how much power that planet must have contained? It seemed like that planet wasn't the only one in this solar system, and there are plenty here that are full of just as many strong beasts."

Flora did know about the meteor strike that had hit the planets, but no one amongst her bothered to put the time to research into it because it was declared that it was something that would only happen once in a million years.

While everyone had their own problems and goals to deal with, this is what Agents of Pure were dealing with.

Suddenly, Erin stopped and immediately pulled out her blade. She hadn't pulled out the demon-tier weapon and was using the katana blade instead. Seeing how she was acting, Flora looked up ahead.

They all did, but none of them could see anything, at least not yet. Until a somewhat large black-furred strange creature appeared on top of one of the dark black hills. It looked similar to an ostrich in size, only it had two heads and a single eye on both of the heads.

Its feathers were also black, making it hard for them to see it clearly. Agent Four lifted up his tablet and went to scan the beast.

"The reading shows this is only a demi-god tier beast. It's not what we are looking for." He explained and carried on walking in a different direction to where the beast was.

The distance was around a kilometre away from the beast, and since it wasn't running after them or trying to attack them, they decided not to bother with it.

"We should be careful." Agent Four added, "Although we are plenty strong, and I have no doubt that we could take on a Demon tier beast just with us, if we end up attracting too much attention, it will prove difficult."

The group continued to walk, but the planet was enormous, around four times the size of Earth, and there was hardly any water on the planet itself, meaning most of it was only landmass. Erin and Flora didn't really know what Agent Four was doing, but he seemed in no rush as he walked around, and they continued to follow him and Zero.

A few minutes later, Erin stopped again and looked at her side. Due to her ability, she had a much wider range to sense threats as compared to everyone else. A few seconds later and now there were two of the same bird-like creature.

"Okay, this is a little bit creepy now. Are they following us?" Flora asked.

"They have yet to attack us, so we should continue to ignore them. We should save our strength for the demon tier beasts." Agent commented.

They continued to treck until eventually they reached what looked like the base of a large volcano. It didn't have lava spewing out of it from the top like the other ones.

"There are several strong readings on the planet, and one of them is coming from the top of this volcano." Agent four explained. "It is one of the weaker readings."

There was something else Agent Four had seen, but he wanted to privately discuss it with Zero. For now, he was following Zero's first order to find a weak demon-tier beast to deal with.

Although he had used those words, weak and Demon tier beast didn't really go together, and on this planet, the readings seemed to be slightly larger compared to the others. It looked like they would have to scale the mountain, but before that, Erin turned around.

"They have gotten braver. I think we have no choice now." Erin commented.

The floor was shaking once again, but it was unlike before. Instead, the shaking felt like it was coming toward them, and it was starting to get intense by the second. Soon, a dust cloud appeared off in the distance, and it was moving toward them.

Finally, at the front of the dust cloud, they could see there was a whole army of these strange bird-like creatures, around fifty or so of them, all charging forward. One of the birds opened its two mouths, and flames began to gather in its mouth.

The next second, it spat out the fire straight towards the group. Erin, moving her hand, threw out two Stage Three Qi blasts, destroying them on impact.

However, that was just the start of the attack. Soon, all of the birds had opened up their mouths, and flames started to gather as they readied to shoot them out.

Erin was ready to change to her other weapon in order to create an Ice wall of some sort and reflect the attack back, but just as she grabbed the handle, someone else walked in front. It wasn't Zero but Agent Four.

"This is a bit annoying, and I hope it doesn't attract the attention of our friend up there." Agent Four said as he placed the tablet away in his large overcoat and pulled something else out.

It looked like a strange red crown. The red crown began to light up when he raised it above his head, and suddenly, a wall of blood aura formed, and the flame balls got deflected or stopped when they struck the wall.

Every time the flame hit the wall, it would ripple, but nothing was getting through.

'This...why does he have powers similar to that of a vampire?' Erin frowned at Agent Four.

****

# Chapter ﻿1887 No Trouble at all

The fifty creatures in front of them were all at the Demi-god level. Although Erin didn't think anyone in the group would have trouble dealing with all fifty on their own, to come out of such a thing unscathed would be troublesome, even for her with the fire-shooting powers.

Perhaps she would have to actually push herself and treat the battle as a real challenge if she didn't want to get hurt.

This was why Erin was quite impressed with what she was seeing right now. The strange red aura was blocking all the incoming attacks, and they didn't seem to be weakening it one bit. Struggling to understand how this was possible, Erin decided to close her eyes to use other senses.

When doing so, she could sense it clearly now. With the help of her ability, she could tell that the power wasn't coming from Agent Four himself. Instead, it was coming from what he was wearing.

'Armour that allows one to produce blood aura? And I can't even gauge if this thing has a limit. I wonder if it can do anything else.' Erin thought.

"Well, it would be a good chance to train, don't you think? While one of us is blocking the attacks, it would be nice if someone could deal with the annoyances on the other side." Zero suggested and smiled.

'Show me, show me the strength you have, the strength you had to take down the leader of the Red Vampires.' Zero squinted his eyes. Even though he had carefully observed Erin training with Flora, it wasn't enough because there was a plan brewing in Zero's head.

'I need to see if I'm strong enough to get rid of you.' Zero inwardly smiled.

While shooting out the strange fireballs from their mouths, the beasts also continued to charge toward them. Erin was ready to pull out her weapon, but before she could, Flora ran ahead.

Pulling out from underneath the armour she was wearing where her breastplate was, Flora had a small little vile that was filled with red liquid. She then splashed it across the legendary sword and swung it from her side.

As she did, the sword swung out wide, as if it was attached by a piece of string, and headed towards the horde at a fast speed. The second the sword touched the first beast, it sliced off its head, but that wasn't the end of the attack.

The sword lit up slightly again, and explosions started to go off one by one. It ripped through the beast in the front while exploding and dealing with the ones on the other side.

'Flora has managed to improve with the weapon quite a bit.' Erin thought. 'And I have learned something about that strange power Agent Four uses. The blood barrier is still up and blocking attacks, but it seems like it can't block attacks from this side.

'I guess Agent Four has the power to control which attacks he lets in and out, but it only works one way.'

Similar to Zero, Erin was also vigilant and had kept a close eye on Agent Four and Zero because she felt like there was a high chance that coming to this secluded planet could be a trap.

After the initial strike from Flora, two-thirds of the beast horde had perished, and many of them were severely injured. Flora then started to swing and pinch the string from where she was in certain ways to make the sword move where she wished.

The sword looked like it was flying as it struck down the beasts one by one. They were clearly no match for the sword, and all of them were soon dealt with. Once the job was done and the sword returned, Flora couldn't help but smile while looking at it.

'Without this sword, I would have never been able to have done something like that, to defeat an army of Demi-god tier beasts. Just what is this thing, and who does it belong to?' Flora thought, fascinated by the sword.

Erin walked over to check on her, but at the same same time, she leaned in and whispered in her ear.

"Save the rest of the blood vials unless you absolutely need it. Even if we are struggling against the Demon-tier, don't use them unless we have to."

Since the sword needed blood to activate, rather than using her own blood, which also worked with the weapon, Flora had brought along about fifteen blood vials to use on the sword, but now only fourteen were left.

"I hope this has scared any of the weaker beasts who are observing us from a distance." Agent Four said, pushing his glasses onto his nose. "Now, we can focus on the bigger things we have to deal with."

The four of them started to scale the mountain, but unlike before, where they walked through the landmass, Agent Four started to run, and so did Zero. After that, they all started to scale the mountain making large leaps.

The path that was being made by Agent Four was quite impressive, and his skills with Qi were great as well, great enough to put him as one of the best.

'I guess he isn't just a man of science after all, and it makes sense if he was able to come to a dangerous planet like this one.'

Eventually, the group reached the top, and Agent Four immediately put the tablet away as they all could see the enemy in front of them.

It was huge in size, around the same size as a school bus, it had the face of what looked like a dragon, and it also had three tales that curved back, each of them had stingers on like that of a scorpion.

It was clear just from looking at it that this was the demon-tier beast.

"What...what should we do first!"

The demon-tier beast had already charged toward them on the ground, and the three singers started to glow a bright red in colour. The air around and above the stingers was distorted, and one could only imagine how hot such a thing was, but just like before, Agent Four stood calm and raised his hand.

As the three stingers were launched towards Agent Four, once again, the red barrier had appeared, blocking the attack. No matter how much the Demon tier beast would pull back and attempt to attack, nothing was getting through.

Since the Demon tier beast was distracted, this also allowed Agent Zero to prepare his own attack. He was holding onto the handle of his sword still in its sheath. Slowly, a huge amount of energy began to build up, and quickly, the sword was pulled out and put straight back in the sheath again.

The next moment, the three singers from the ground fell onto the floor.

"You can't be doing all the work here," Zero said. "This is meant to be a group effort."

Pulling out her large demon-tier sword from her back, Erin was ready to act. After a minute had passed, the demon-tier beast had been defeated, and Flora was left speechless.

In the battle, she had done nothing to join in the fight.

'Demon-tier breasts are meant to be one of the strongest things in the world, right? Many strong people, even the strongest, struggle against them, so how did the three of them make it look so easy.'

The crystal was extracted and passed to Agent Four, and with the beast dead, no injuries and none of them tired, it looked like they were ready to move on to the next location.

"A Demon tier crystal of this calibre won't give us much", Zero complained. "Agent Four, move us into more difficult beings."

Although Demon tier beasts were the highest tier of beasts, there was a large and varying range in terms of strength between them. For instance, even a humanoid demon tier beast was far stronger than a regular one like they had dealt with.

However, there was something that was seriously concerning for Agent Four because he noticed a reading of something off in the distance that was going off the charts, something beyond that of a demon-tier beast.

# Chapter ﻿1888 Universal Bounty

It had been a while since Quinn's last visit, and the Celestial Space hadn't been the same as it was once before. There was an uneasy tension just lying around as those who called themselves gods of the Universe walked around.

There were several reasons for this, and it was mainly due to the fact that things that had never happened before or hadn't happened for a long time were occurring. Thankfully, one of the main causes for concern, BB, hadn't returned to Celestial Space since.

It made others start to wonder if things were starting to turn around for good. However, that was impossible.

"I feel something's about to happen," said Xox, the floating ball Celestial who pretty much only spent his time in Celestial Space.

"You have that tingling feeling in your ball again." Another Celestial laughed while observing one of the many white Spaces.

"This isn't the time to joke!" Xox retorted, "Have you not heard? Mundus gave out words for everyone from Earth. They haven't been making any moves and just been watching, which is what worries me even more."

The energy figure next to Xox started to shiver as he heard the name.

"I thought they weren't going to act until they heard back from Immortui."

"And do you think Immortui will even reply?" Xox replied back.

The Celestial energy said nothing because it was a good point to make. While the two were in the middle of discussing such events, it was at that very moment that every single person had revised a message at the same time.

Xox immediately opened it, and so did the others. Immediately there were whispers and talk about what was about to happen.

[A meeting has been called, and everyone must attend. It begins in 10 minutes, in Area 666.]

In a fraction of a second, Xox could soon see multiple people entering the Space who weren't in it before. It looked like the message was sent out not just to the Celestials in the Space but to the ones who were outside as well.

As for why everyone was complying and listening to such a message, it was because the message came from Mundus himself, the one that was known as the messenger in this place.

Xox and his new friend immediately went to gather in Area 666. It was packed with Celestials from all over the Universe. The Celestials were crowded so close together that it looked like just one blob of light in some places.

Luckily for Xox, he could float, so he rose up above the others to get a clear view, and sure enough, standing on the other side was the messenger Mundus. No one said a word because he wasn't just any messenger but the one who spoke on behalf of the Ancient Ones.

In the Celestial Space, Mundus wasn't a ball of energy like others. Rather, his physical body was present. He was a tall black-skinned figure with a large square mouth with sharp teeth. His head was also long and rectangular in shape. There were four pairs of eyes that went up the large head as well.

As for Mundus's clothing, it was a red robe that dangled over him, covering his entire body and whatever was underneath it.

"Enough of you have gathered now," Mundus spoke, and it echoed in all of their minds at the same time. "This message can be passed on to those that are not here."

Mundus looked out as if he was looking for someone, but the person he was looking for was nowhere to be found.

"I didn't expect him to come." Mundus said and continued, "We are well aware that there has been a problem, and at first, we were to leave it to Immortui. In the past, he has dealt with the problems that have occurred, and we were sure that he would do the same now.

"To be honest, we do not doubt his powers and believe that he can still deal with the problem if he's given some time. However, whether he likes it or not, the ancient ones have decided that the issue can not grow anymore with those from Earth!"

Xox gulped. This was what he was afraid of, and he knew that their anger would mostly be directed towards BB, and Xox had somewhat helped BB, so he was afraid that he might be targeted as well if they mistook them as friends.

"The number of powerful Gods Slayers from Earth has increased at an unprecedented rate, and there have been no signs of it stopping. We believed that a new Celestial had come into being to make sure the balance was restored, but it turns out the Universe had made a mistake.

"For the one known as BB is fighting with them and against us. BB is strong, and he is growing quite a strong force with him. However, we are sure he will come around, as we all remember what it was like to be a young Celestial.

"However, the ancient ones have asked us to deal with the God Slayers themselves." Mundus lifted his arm, and several images of the God Slayer appeared in front of all of them.

"These are the ones that you should fear. We are not asking you to engage with them, but instead, pass on information to us if you do find them. We will then request our strongest fighting Celestials to take care of them. "

One by one as Mundus called the names of Celestials, and they came out from the crowd proud to be called.

"Zeko, Kipo, Tumoon, Hinto, Weet, and Gorgath. These Celestials have each defeated countless God Slayers and will be asked to do the same again. We ask that everyone aid them in the journey to find and defeat these God Slayers."

Looking at those that had come up to the stage, Mundus realized that Gorgath had never come up.

"Where is Gorgath?" Mundus asked.

"Gorgath is currently fighting against another God Slayer!" A Celestial answered. "I work in his solar system. When he is done, I will pass the message onto him."

Mundus nodded, and with that said and done, the meeting came to an end, and all the Celestials dispersed, leaving Xox to give out a big sigh.

'I guess this is the sign that they want to put Earth back in its place.' Xox thought. 'The ancient ones probably don't want to act due to Immortui. For now, they don't seem to be going after BB either, so I'm safe.'

Floating towards the large images that had been left up, Xox looked at them all, and he recognized one of them, the most famous God Slayer out of them all at the moment.

"This was the one that fought alongside BB. If the two of them are together, then it could be a problem again. If this doesn't work...will the ancient ones finally get involved."

In total, there were eight images of God Slayers on the screen. It was certainly a large number. What was more impressive was the fact that all of the God Slayers had appeared recently.

Usually, it would take years and years for God Slayers to appear, but with everything the human race had been through, they had produced monsters.

The first one that Xox recognized was Sil. As for the rest, he didn't know, but Bliss, who had also joined the meeting quite late, was looking at the images well.

"So they have finally targeted them."

After Sil, there was the image of Chris, then Zero. It was impressive to see Zero up there, but Bliss knew that it would happen sooner or later. After that, there was Erin, then Russ, a recent ally she had been working with, who she had to warn.

On top of that, there was an old friend's image on there as well, Ray. Besides them, there were two more that Bliss had recognized but was surprised to see they had reached God Slayer level, especially since she had thought one of them was dead.

# Chapter ﻿1889 Too Easy

During this trip, all of the Demon tier crystals that were gathered were to go to Zero and Agent 4. That was the arrangement that was made beforehand. Although Flora felt like it was unfair and they were being used, Erin asked her what choice did they have?

They were now hiding behind Pure and were planning to use their army for their goal, and at the same time, they were staying with Pure and being fed every day. Because of all of these things, they weren't really in the position to bargain. At the end of the day, she felt like they were getting more out of this deal than the other.

On top of that, Erin felt like she didn't need anything more in the first place, in terms of equipment.

With her Demon tier armour and Demon tier weapon, she was at the strongest she had ever been and defeating Laxmus was proof of that, she could feel it.

Although the dhampir's energy increased depending on the vampire that she would go up against, each time she fought against stronger vampires, it was almost as if a permanent part of that rise in energy was added to herself.

She had felt it after fighting Leo, and she had felt it after fighting Laxmus as well. Her strength felt endless, but would she be able to meet someone at the level above Laxmus, Erin could only think of the possible original vampires that were still in their tombs.

"There are roughly around 500 signals of those that are at the Demon tier level here." Agent 4 informed.

Hearing this number, Flora nearly dropped her sword.

"500 hundred." She repeated and gulped.

Demon tiers were incredibly rare, not even every planet had a Demon tier beast on it, which made her wonder just what was this solar system. Was every planet like this filled with deadly Demon tier beasts?

However, it made Flora realize what Pure's plan was. If they could gather as many crystals as they could this time, it would allow them to create weapons and give them to their army.

After that, the army with Demon tier weapons could then travel to these planets and fight on their own, gathering even more Demon tier crystals. Their group would be unstoppable and there would be no match for them. Green City would be annihilated easily.

"I guess that means there is still a lot of work for us to do then." Erin claimed.

The group went off from the volcanic mountain, and headed to the next energy source. This area was in a more difficult terrain for them as it was inside of what looked like a mound in the ground.

They went through this large entrance that was filled with webs all over the place, then when they got to the end, they were in some type of large open area.

Waiting for them, there was what looked like a giant spider, only there was a female body that seemed to be attached to the upper half of the it.

"Is this a humanoid beast?" Zero asked.

"Not quite, but judging by the readings, it is stronger than the last." Agent 4 replied.

Zero planned to take a back seat in this fight, because he was hoping it would be enough to give Erin a challenge and it seemed like she was up for it as well.

Entering the space, Erin held out her sword and fired out an ice tunnel directly toward the strange spider creature. When the tunnel got close it looked like its instinct had kicked in as it leapt up and landed right on top of the tunnel.

'Yes! Now that spider is going to be frozen in place making this easy!' Flora thought.

However, the tips of the spider's feet looked red hot. Steam was being produced from the ice as it was attempting to freeze the spider but it wasn't working at all. Before they knew it, the Demon tier beast was running down the ice tunnel straight towards the group.

"Interesting, then let's try fighting it seriously!" Erin said putting her large Demon sword away and pulling out her blood sword instead.

As she ran forward she started to swing her sword letting out yellow lines of aura. They hit the spider, bouncing off its hard skin, but it looked like that was only to get rid of the legs in front. Erin had quickly slid underneath so she was now under the spider.

She let go of her sword, throwing it in the air and spinning it, making it float for a brief second. Her entire body started to glow yellow all over, from the tip of her toes to the strands of hair on the top of her head. Then with one movement, she pushed and slammed the bottom of the sword with the palm of her hand.

A giant arrow of yellow aura had erupted and lifted the spider woman in the air. Blood started to pour from underneath, and as a last resort the spider part of the Demon tier beast opened its mouth, spewing hot lava all over.

It looked like there was a moment where Erin needed to catch her breath after using her move. Meaning she couldn't straight up avoid the lava, but it was not a worry to her.

"Finish the job Flora." Erin stated as she stood there and her armour started to glow.

Flora was already on the move having swung her sword out once again. The Demon tier beast was already heavily weakened from the single blow, so it was unable to block the sword swiping right at the female body's head, and cutting it off, killing the Demon tier beast.

As for Erin, she was completely fine, and had gotten out of the situation she was in, unscathed and walking away she left Zero and Agent 4 to do the dirty work of obtaining the crystal.

Zero walked up to the Demon tier beast and was thinking about what he had seen.

'The attack from a Demon tier beast is nothing to laugh at, especially when it's on its final legs. However, to come out without being hit. Her Demon tier armour… does it allow her to phase through any attack?'

'I have to find out more before making my decision about what to do. What is the cool down time, what other things is she hiding as well, and the amount of Qi and Dhampir aura she displayed in that single instant was fascinating.'

After taking out the crystal, Zero went to Agent 4 because he had made a decision.

"We need something stronger, a lot stronger than this. Take us to the largest energy source that this planet has to offer." Zero asked.

There was hesitation in Agent 4's voice as he looked at the readings. He wasn't sure when to make Zero aware of this.

"Sir, are you sure, the reading I hav-"

"Do you really think we would struggle, we have possibly the four strongest people from earth here right now. She had practically defeated the Demon tier beast by herself. We need something that can challenge us."

Just as everyone was getting ready to leave, the whole cave that they were in was starting to shake, to rumble, and part of the ceiling was falling down.

"Is it an earthquake or a volcano?" Flora asked.

The shaking continued one after the other, and the variations in shaking continued as well.

Looking at his tablet, there was a bad feeling that was going through his stomach. The energy readings that he was seeing were starting to grow, they were getting higher with the rumbling which made him assume it had to be from them.

'Just what is causing this, a humanoid Demon tier beast? But… there are two readings on this device.'
