# Chapter 1910 The World Battle (Part 4)

After seeing Chris transform into a large gigantic wolf, Peter was left confused for a few seconds. For one, he was unaware that Chris could even do such a thing. After hearing about the fight between him and Quinn, there was no mention of Chris turning his body into a full wolf.

Of course, Peter did know about his werewolf form, and understood that with that, his Qi, and all the training he had done that was how he had gotten so powerful, and yet, why was he now a wolf?

The thing was, just looking at it, he didn't look like any ordinary wolf, at least not the ones that Peter had seen. The sheer size of Chris was different, he was as large as a car.

Even though he was covered in fur, the outline of his muscles on his legs and more could still be seen, and the fangs on his two front teeth as well as the claws on his paws, were larger. Almost abnormally large, even for the size that the wolf was.

"Get on!" Chris said, his voice lower than before, almost like a growl. It was also hard for Peter to understand the wolf form of Chris with his two large front teeth sticking out from his mouth.

With the attack coming their way, Chris didn't ask twice, and instead just ran towards Peter as if he was charging right at him. It was in that moment that Peter understood what this form could do differently than Chris's regular self and using all his strength he grabbed onto Chris and held on.

Quickly getting on his back and using the strength in his legs, Peter was doing his best to hold on, as Chris zipped around the place, making sure Hinto couldn't guess their next move.

There was a reason why Chris hadn't used this form against Quinn, because in his mind it was useless. The current form that Chris was in, it was weaker in terms of strength, and its fighting capability was limited.

Against someone like Quinn who had a versatile use of abilities and could attack from anywhere, there would be no hope. However, what this form did allow for Chris, compared to his normal state, was speed.

He was faster than he usually would be, and although he knew that alone wouldn't be enough to beat Hinto, in this fight he wasn't alone. The strength wouldn't come from him, instead the attacks were to come from Peter instead.

After successfully stabbing Hinto in the shoulder, Peter pulled out the head tail and started to strike towards his head again. Just before it reached, the two trunks on Hinto's head had curled forward and once again, had grabbed onto Peter's head tail stopping him in his tracks, at least, almost.

Before this could occur, Chris leapt up in the air, pulling back. And at the right moment, so Hinto couldn't chase, both Laxmus and Zinon continued to fire lightning strikes as well as blood aura shots toward Hinto.

Whether it was hurting him or wearing him down they didn't know, but in this situation they were currently in, it was clear they were playing the supporting role in this fight.

If they could just hinder Hinto for a few seconds, while Chris got away, or something, then it would work out in the end.

Once again though, the smoke cleared, and the black flamed swords were seen. For the first time, Hinto had gotten in a fighting stance, with one sword held upward and another below. He was shifting his foot carefully as he moved in the direction from where he assumed that the werewolf was coming.

Chris pounced forward and attacked from the side, and Peter's head tail went for the side this time. Hinto had moved the sword ever so slightly, but he had missed blocking it by a few seconds and a large cut was made right on Hinto's shoulder as it slashed him.

The second Chris moved away, he pounced forward again getting into a rhythm, and a strike from Peter's head tail was used. With Chris's speed and Peter's power it was easily cutting through the celestial's flesh causing his blood to fall on the ground.

Slash after slash was made on the shoulders of the celestial, creating more and more marks, but eventually Chris needed to take a break as he backed away, which gave the others time to attack again.

"Hey, why don't you aim for his head, kill him and get this over and done with!" Chris shouted.

Qi was channelling mainly through his legs. It was to allow him to move as fast as possible, and honestly everytime Chris went in he was afraid that it was possible, without the second stage of Qi covering him and not being in his other form, that single hit could get him killed.

"Are you an idiot!" Peter replied back. "One… it's hard to hit him properly with how fast you're moving, and two… I am trying to hit him in the head, but I think he can see. I think he can still see us."

The comment was strange, but Peter felt it, when there were times when he went to aim for the head, it was almost as if Hinto would move in a way so the only target Peter had left was his shoulders, otherwise he would just end up hitting the swords anyway.

"Look at this, look how good they're doing!"

"What do you mean look at this, I can't see a single thing." Another replied.

"The camera is just picking up blurs, you would have to slow down the footage to see what was happening."

And that was what some viewers had done, slowing down the image and creating a still frame of Peter riding on top of the wolf. It certainly was a sight to behold, something they hadn't seen before, and some were already using the pictures from this as their background on their phones and screens.

There was a huge rush of support for the two of them to take out this being that they had seen as a celestial.

"You damn aliens! You think you can just attack our planets and think we won't do anything!!"

Now that they had recovered, Chris went in once again.

"I can try slowing down just at the right time, that way you get a better hit onto the head of the celestial. Can you charge up more power, more energy for an attack?"

"No, don't do that!" Peter shouted back, still having this strange feeling.

Chris decided to listen to Peter and charged full force ahead just like before, and with the head tail, Peter gathered all of the celestial energy he could to the point. He could tell that this was the energy, this was the power that was giving Hinto the most trouble, and he was right.

Scrunching up his head tail, Peter started to twist it and wound it up like a spring on the top of his head. Chris's claws dug deep into the ground, breaking it, and the stone tiles went flying as he charged forward.

It was then that the red light from Hinto started to shine brighter, spreading to his dreaded eyes, and it looked like his entire body was in flames. He moved his swords once, no longer having them on the side as before, no longer blocking his head and body and instead just by his side.

"SCREW IT, JUST DIE!" Ignoring all his feelings, Peter knew he had to depend on this attack, if they couldn't kill it now, with everyone giving it everything they had, then what else could he do.

At the right time, the head tail sprung out, and spun, it had even stretched as it strangely grew from Peter's head outwards. The point was covered in a strange dark black substance as Peter used all the strength he could muster up.

Hinto smiled, taking a step forward and moving both of his swords in an X shape. The two could now be seen having crossed paths. The camera was showing the two of them having traded places but was unable to see what had occurred.

Until, falling from the sky, was Peter's head tail, hitting the ground, blood everywhere pouring from the end. At the same time, a large deep cross had been made on Peter's chest, blood was oozing out of him… what little he had in his body anyway.

"PETER!!!!" Lucia screamed from the sidelines.

******

# Chapter 1911 The World Battle (Part 5)

The camera had zoomed in on the weird head tail like object, and the viewers were in complete shock. To them It looked like they were winning the fight, the Wolf duo team had the upper edge, even the cuts on the celestial's arm were still present.

Which made them wonder, how had the tables had turned just like that, and when they couldn't even see what had occurred. Blood soaked the end of the head tail, and soon it started to disappear into nothing but dust, as the black flames had consumed it, burning it until it was completely gone.

"What is going on!"

"Are they going to be okay? They can still fight, right? I mean his hand was cut off before and they could still fight!"

The viewers were worried and on top of that, they had heard someone scream on the camera.

"PETER!!!"

Turning quickly, they could see that there was a female in white robes, the traditional outfit of the Graylash family, she had a spear in her hand and tears were falling from her face.

So far she had stayed out of the fight, because if Zinon and others couldn't really help, then what use would she be, but it was taking every fiber in her body to not run out there and be right by Peter's side right now.

'I have to stay here, I can't… I can't run out there. If I do, then I will just become a target and put Peter in more danger, but please Peter, don't die!" Lucia thought as she closed her eyes, squinting and falling to her knees due to how helpless she felt.

Chirs could feel some of the blood falling onto his back. There strangely didn't seem to be a lot, but that's when they were reminded that Peter was an undead in the first place. Blood in his body didn't really matter.

"Peter, are you okay… can you still fight?" Chris asked.

There was no visible wound on top of Peter's head, that was because it had already somewhat seared and healed up. In the first place, the head tail was just an extension of Peter's powers when activating his celestial form, and he was still full of power.

His body was still lit up, in a red aura, and his arms were encased in black and beaming with energy as well.

"Don't worry, he didn't aim for the head." Peter mumbled, as he grinded his teeth… annoyed at what had happened so far.

,m The truth was, Chris was surprised that he hadn't been hit in the attack at all. For some reason Hinto had only aimed for Peter.

'Does he see him more as a threat than me? But I thought that he was after me?' Chris thought.

"What are you doing, let's go in again!" Peter said, slamming his fists together.

"But your tail thing, it isn't growing back!" Chris asked.

"Does that matter, you think I only know how to fight with that. If he cuts off my head tail, I'll use my arms, if he cuts off those, I'll use my legs, and if he cuts off all my limbs, I'll just have to use my head, even if my eyeballs are the only thing left… I'll kill this guy!" Peter shouted.

Chris started to run around the place, there was still support coming from Laxmus and Zinon, seeing the tense and rough situation, but now it looked like those attacks weren't hitting either. As fast as Zinon lighting attacks were, Hinto would lift his sword at the right time completely blocking the attack as his flames just engulfed whatever there was of the lightning and it was the same with the red aura as well.

Right now, the only attack that had gone through was Peter's; it was the only attack that had hurt him so far. Chris knew this as well, which was why he wasn't against Peter's idea, there was nothing else that had worked.

'I have to play my part as well, without the reach of the head tail and the flexibility, I will just have to go faster!' Chris thought as he was going to muster every bit of strength.

"Chris… whatever happens just keep moving, it will be our only chance, just keep moving towards him in and out, and attack no matter what happens, there will be a chance!" Peter claimed.

The claws of Chris dug in deeper into the ground, the truth was this form took a lot of energy and he was tired, but he had to fight it, he needed to dig deep, otherwise everyone here would be dead, including him.

'I'm not tired, I still have plenty of energy, I'm the strongest there is!' Chris thought to himself as he boosted forward, straight towards Hinto.

It was faster than he had gone before, this rise in strength Chris could feel it, once again during a tough battle he was improving, his Qi was growing and he was using a combination of everything that was in his body.

Peter's fist started to glow in a yellow light, as Chris dodged slightly to the side and went to swipe with his paw, but Hinto had lifted his sword deflecting the claw, and at the same time, towards Peter's fist, he went past and cut a line directly down the side.

The sword went deep and Peter's arm had been sliced sideways.

"Remember what I said!" Peter shouted.

As soon as Chris found footing, he went forward again, charging in from a different side, trying to help; he used his claws but they would constantly get blocked by a blade.

This time though, Peter had managed to get a hit, punching Hinto on his right shoulder, but as soon as he touched the skin, there was no weight behind the punch… he could tell that there was no impact.

Once again, Hinto had diffused the energy of the attack, moving to the side, and slicing the sword down, Peter's other arm was out of order.

Chris, not really knowing what was going on, continued with Peter's command and went in again, at a lightning fast speed, and had success himself as he had hit Hinto's legs from underneath causing his body to spin in the air.

Peter then leapt, and kicked back into the ground, the whole area caved in and the buildings closest started to fall as their foundations were broken.

While dropping down, with his hands not working like they used to before, he only had the choice of using another leg. As he got close, a sword could be seen and it had completely been sliced off.

Peter landed on one leg, and fell to the floor, both his arms were gone, the muscles at least in the other one making it impossible for him to pick himself off of the ground or at least hard to.

The viewers that were watching this, had stopped typing, as they placed their hands on their mouths, or covered their eyes. The horrid condition that Peter was currently in was unbearable to watch, but most of all, it was the fact that he wasn't crawling away, and instead was using every working muscle in his body to move towards Hinto.

Hinto, with the sword in his hand, lifted it, ready to finish Peter off.

"NO!!!" Lucia screamed and could't take it anymore. If Peter was to die, then she knew that they were all going to die in this place. She grabbed her spear and started to thrust it forward shooting out red sparks of lightning.

Zinon did the same, and surprisingly they weren't the only ones. All of those that had been watching the fight, started to come out from their homes. They began to use all of their powers, their abilities, anything they could… and fired it towards where Peter and Hinto were, anything to stop them from killing the brave man that had stuck up for them.

"I'm sorry Peter, but I can't follow your order anymore!'' Chris said as he used his teeth to pick up Peter off the ground and head away.

Now Hinto was just shaking his head, as all of these attacks were coming towards him.

"If you all didn't get involved, then you all wouldn't have to die."

Chris had appeared by the others' side, including Lucia, and she quickly had grabbed his body from his mouth. She looked at Peter, tears flowing out.

"Peter… you have done so much, you have done enough already… please let's just enjoy our final moments together," Lucia said. "Please I… I want to tell you something… I'm not sure if you feel the same way, but I have to tell you… I love you!"

Several loud bangs were heard as the abilities had hit Hinto in the centre. There were hundreds of people, and with the help of Zinon and Laxmus the attacks were no small feat.

"Love.." Peter smiled. "That's a word I don't really understand, but what I do know is, you've given up too easily… I won't give up."

As Peter said those words, the amulet, the demon tier amulet that had the celestial marking around Lucia's neck, started to glow.

****

# Chapter 1912 The World Battle (Part 6 Final)

The amulet that had been received from Quinn was a blessing to Lucia. It had given her powers and strength to fight in situations where she wouldn't have been able to fight. It allowed her to use blood aura, even though she herself wasn't a vampire.

At the same time, the blood clone was able to get her out of multiple different situations. There was a thing as well, the more blood that was split around her and the more time spent using it, the more powerful the amulet would become.

However, other than using the blood aura, she never really knew how to draw out more power. It was almost as if she could feel there was more power in the amulet but had no clue how to get it out of there.

It made her wonder if she was the right person to have it, if perhaps it would have worked better with a vampire, but this was an heirloom from her family, and Quinn said she deserved it.

Yet, for the first time ever, it felt like she was activating the Amulet, but on a whole other level. It started to glow, and energy was being drawn out of not just her, but also the amulet, and it was going to none other than the person she was holding onto.

All of the blood from the battle, all of the power the amulet had contained until now, was flowing into Peter. The marking on Peter, and the marking on the amulet started to light up as energy was being drawn between the two of them.

Blood aura started to form out from Peter, where his limbs would be. They began to harden and form a shape, turning into a solid red colour. They were clearly not part of Peter's original body but now he could stand, and he had his arms back again.

He stood up from where he was, breaking away from Lucia.

"I don't know what you did, but you've given me the chance to kick that guy's arse once again." Peter exclaimed with a wide grin on his face.

"Wolf boy, we're attacking again, and this really is the last chance we have." Peter exclaimed.

The viewers watching, seeing Peter stand again, thought it was some type of miracle. They had heard the confession on camera by the female, and they were starting to believe it was the miracle of love.

Meanwhile, Zinon, who was close by, had a thought in his head.

,m 'We have to do something, we all have to do something, the attacks from everyone has bought us some time, but that won't be enough!'

Chris was already moving, and had allowed for Peter to jump on once again. Just before they set off toward Hinto, Lucia had a few final words.

"Don't die."

Peter didn't say anything as he went off, back toward where Hinto was, the constant barrage of attacks from everyone were continuing, but Hinto's whole body was now lighting up in a black flame. As the attacks got close, they just disintegrated before even being able to touch him.

"You idiots, this fire is no ordinary fire. Do you think your attacks, your energy, can even harm me? Hinto claimed.

It was true, the attacks weren't working at all and it was due to the amount of celestial energy Hinto had. Just because a celestial had large amounts of celestial energy didn't mean they were a fighter, and strong creatures, beasts, and beings could harm celestials even without the use of celestial energy if they were strong enough.

However, the amount of celestial energy could be used as a type of barrier. It was a reason why some gods, although not fighters, found it hard to even be hurt by mere beings, and it was this case right now.

The only thing was, there was a being that had celestial energy, right here in front of him, and he had just gained a bit of a boost from a particular item. Unbeknownst to him, Peter had more celestial energy than he usually would have.

"Peter, I'm going to try something and it's all up to you to create an opening but, let's finish him off here!" Chris stated.

The two were running at full force, and for the first time rather than just standing still, Hinto ran forward. The attacks from the public stopped, everyone watching online held their breath and weren't blinking to see this final moment.

In front of Hinto's path, a big beam of red aura was shot out, right in front of Hinto. For some reason he had stopped, even with the flames on his body, as if he was afraid that it was going to hurt him.

At that moment, turning into a lightning bolt, Zinon had zapped himself up and directly behind Hinto.

'Everything… the timing is for this moment.'

Zinon had the lightning bolt in his hand and stabbed it right into Hinto's back, but to do that, his hands had to go through the flames. He had covered his hands with lightning but that didn't seem to matter. Still, he didn't care as the lightning bolt had successfully pierced the back of his body.

'Even if this slows him down for a second it will be okay.'

Straight after, Zinon had turned into a lightning bolt going back to where Lucia was. That's when she could see that the black flames were covering his hands, and they were spreading quickly.

"What is happening?" Lucia asked.

"Chop them off!" Zinon ordeed. "Before it's too late, chop them off."

Grabbing a beast weapon from the ground, she squinted as she listened to the order and just as the flames were about to reach his elbow, she swung the sword down, chopping off his arms right by the elbow.

Zinon gathered his lightning powers, trying to spark the ends to sear them off, so he wouldn't bleed to death, as he saw both his arms burn away into nothing but dust.

'I hope it was worth it, you two.'

Just then, in the middle of running toward Hinto, Chris started to transform back into his human state. It flung Peter forward slightly and in the middle of transforming back, Chris used all the strength and muscles in his hand to grab Peter and chuck him forward.

It propelled him even further, and before Hinto could lift his blades that were down by his side, Peter had slammed an energized red punch right into Hinto's face for the first time. It was a solid hit, and blood came right out from Hinto's mouth as his head was flung back.

Right after Peter had thrown a punch, Chirs then dug both his claws into his body, and lifted him up in the air. Blood was dripping from his wounds onto the ground.

Bending his knees, Peter was preparing for one last attack, all of the energy in his body was accumulating in his fist, his whole arm was shaking, the ground around them was shaking with power, and once again there was a new rise in power that he could feel in him as his hand started to glow red and the aura flowed around the area.

——

'I don't know what you're doing Peter, but whatever it is, right now, I know you need it a lot more than me.' Quinn thought.

[Celestial energy has been transferred]

Chris held him there, so there was a target for Peter to hit onto. Blasting off from his legs, all of the energy in his fist was going right towards Hinto's head. A loud churning sound was heard as the ground sunk in the entire area a good meter deep.

It almost felt as if the piece of land they were on, had sunken below sea level and that's what had happened, as the water went onto parts of the land for a few seconds, before rising back up to what it was.

Hinto put his swords in an X shape, trying to block the attack, the flames covered his sword, but the second Peter's fist touched the flames, it did nothing and then both of the blades broke as the fist continued hitting Hinto in the head, destroying it in an instant and turning it into nothing, allowing for his body to fall on the ground.

Peter collapsed and Chirs collapsed, falling to the floor, and Hinto's body disintegrated into nothing but particles. As Peter laid there on the ground, there was a thought in his head.

'Quinn… I could feel it, you helped me didn't you… but are you okay?' Peter thought.

*****

# Chapter 1913 An Undead Heart

During the entire fight, Aj was doing splendid work, and at the same time, the video feed was being sent to his editing team, who were able to slow down the frames and cut parts of the video into smaller clips. The edited version was now being shared and shown to others around.

At the moment, Aj's careful camera work continued as he zoomed in on the body of the celestial in the air, and before it even touched the ground, the body looked to have broken down into several particles and had completely disappeared, surprising everyone.

It was a clear sign that the fight was over, the intruder that had attacked was dealt with, and they were no longer in immediate danger.

Slowly, Aj jumped down from the building, and he wasn't alone as people slowly started to come out of their homes and hiding places one by one.

"Everyone...it looks like the fight is over..the Graylash planet is now safe, and it's all because of them! Because of these people right here in front of us!" Aj shouted.

The crowd around responded to this. They could tell that the nightmare was over. They had never dealt with something so frightening as this. None of them was ever born during the Dalki war and had only heard about it.

This battle had frightened them to their toes. And the fact that the powers and abilities of the general public had even begun to weaken due to the peaceful period after the Dalki War only made the situation worse. Only those that wished to continue to fight or become Travellers had honed their abilities and powers.

It was the first time in a long period that humans were to draw upon their powers like that. It was a battle for their survival on the Graylash planets, which have been deemed as a safe haven for centuries.

"Man, do you see the state of that square? It's completely cracked."

"Yeah, and look at that sword attack from before. Did anyone look at the clip? I think it sliced houses for miles on end in half."

Due to the massive force that they were fighting against each other with, it was next to impossible for them to really know the level of each of the attacks because they would either miss, collide against each other or be dealt with on their own body.

It was safe to say that both Peter and Chris were exhausted. Peter, who usually had an unlimited amount of stamina, couldn't move his body as he lay there slowly, just twitching his fingers. As for Chris, he had never felt this sore from over-exerting his body in a very, very long time.

Sure he had suffered from pain when fighting against Quinn, but this was pain from using his werewolf form, among other things, to the very limit. While on the ground, Chris tilted his head towards Peter and looked back at the fight.

'This person, they said they were celestial. That's what Quinn was talking about, right?' Chris thought, thinking back to Quinn's explanation of where he had been and another world out there. As to why he was being targeted, he didn't know.

That was because Quinn hadn't told Chris about him being classified as a Godslayer.

'In a way...if I assess my performance in this fight, I believe I fought better compared to when I was up against Quinn. In terms of skill, this Hinto was far better.

'Maybe it's because all he was using was his swords, but he was a true master. I couldn't even land a full-strength hit on him, but even when I did, it felt like my attack was only able to get through a little, and a lot of my momentum was dispersing fast.'

Thinking about it more, Chris wondered if Peter was also using the energy. If he was, then what was the difference between the two? Because without a doubt, if he and Peter were to fight, Chris knew that he would be the winner.

In either form, he truly believed that Peter was strong, but compared to the two of them, with both their bodies having incredible regeneration, Chris's fighting prowess was just more deadly.

In the end, Chris could only imagine it was the strange energy he felt Peter use at the end which could make the real difference, but he had no idea where that had come from.

'If he had that kind of energy, he should have used it from the beginning.'

'It happened when he talked with Lucia? Was it her, is it the power of love?' Chris thought, soon pulling a face. 'No way, it can't be something that corny.'

In the end, both Chris and Peter started to regain their energy a bit. They slowly got off the ground and could see that the others were staying far away. Families were hugging each other with tears of Joy.

Laxmus had been flying in the sky so far and eventually landed right in front of Peter.

"Hey, you didn't do so much for a bad job for your first fight," Peter said. "It seems you're quite smart."

"Yeah, apart from the fact that he nearly destroyed a whole street of houses." A voice said.

Looking up from the creator that they had made, they could see that Zinon and Lucia were on edge. The two of them started to slide down into the crater to see how the others were doing.

Slowly standing up and squinting their eyes when they opened them up again, they could see Zinon close and something shocked the both of them.

"Your...your arms! Are they going to grow back?" Peter asked.

From the elbow down, the ends had been sealed and were slightly black, so they weren't bleeding, but it was obvious what had happened.

Zinon shook his head.

"I'm afraid I am not a monster like you two. If my arms were still present, then maybe I could use some Qi, or go to a doctor healer or something, and have them reattached, but they completely disappeared in those black flames."

These words showed Chris how dangerous the black flames were for him. He had also seen what Zinon did at the end. The latter had risked his life to slow down Hinto. Even if it had only helped delay the latter by a fraction of a second, it was quite possible that was what had saved their lives, allowing for them to win the fight.

"When we are done with what we need to do, if there is ever a time where you need help, then please let me know. We owe you a lot." Chris said.

The fight had drawn all of them closer as they took down a common enemy. Lucia glanced at Peter. He still had his blood hardened for his limbs.

It was unsure how long this would last, but one thing was for sure, he would need some food. Without it, maybe anytime soon, he would start going on an eating rampage, and that's what he needed for his limbs to come back as well.

Or at least for them to heal back the way they were, unlike Zinon, Peter's limbs were still in the square somewhere. As the group turned around, ready to leave the place, they could see several people standing on the outside of the crater.

"There we have it folks, all of the people in here were the ones responsible for defeating the being who called itself a Celestial!" Aj reported. "Even our very own Graylash leader has been severely injured while protecting us. Everyone, we must burn this image of our heroes in our mind."

Everyone around started to cheer as they shouted words of thanks, cheering at the top of their lungs for the people in front of them. At that moment and time, they didn't care if they were vampires, humans, part of the Graylash or Pure faction. They just wanted to show their gratitude then and there.

"Peter," Lucia whispered. "I think you should get out of here. Aren't you hungry?" Lucia whispered.

It was then that Lucas spotted this, and he was also one of the vampires that had seen the two talking before and the confession of love. A deep smile appeared on his face as he opened up his mouth.

"Kiss! The two of you love each other, and we all know it already! Why are you holding back? Kiss already!" Lucas shouted.

Lucia's face went bright red, as she didn't know what to do or say, but that's when a chant began.

"Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!" The chants continued as she closed her eyes but soon felt something on her face, a strange feeling of warmth on her cheek. Opening her eyes, she saw that it was Peter's blood-hardened hand.

"I don't know what the hell I'm doing," Peter said. "But, I'm going to do it anyway because I think I want to."

Leaning forward, Peter pressed his lips against Lucia's. And a cheering roar louder than when the battle concluded erupted from the crowd.

# Chapter 1914 The Spread Of Death

The news reports were spread around the world of AJ's footage discussing multiple things, and the headlines seemed to be changing every fifteen minutes as the topics moved from one to the other.

Will the Graylash leader Zinon retire?

Who are the heroes that fought against the mystery beast?

Who is Zombie boy?

Who is Zombie boy's mystery lover?

There was a lot of praise from those online about what Peter had done, and even more so, the clip of the two kissing, towards the end, was one of the most viewed videos, but perhaps it was because of what the person who had been deemed 'Zombie boy' had said or done after the kiss that made it become a hit.

After giving the kiss, Peter pulled away and held Lucia by the side of her arms.

"Peter… Lucia said in a soft voice as she looked into his eyes. "Do you feel the same way?"

Peter stayed there in silence, not saying a word and eventually let go, and jumped out of the area. Where to, who knew, but his reaction had caused multiple questions to be asked. Whether or not the Zombie boy was just shy, or maybe he had no feelings whatsoever.

Either way, it was something that people were interested in following, and it was one of the most requested follow ups for AJ and his team.

However, the most important topic that was to come out of the filming was this... Is humanity in danger once more?

The topic was about the threat that had attacked them, it was something they had never seen before and the being had called themselves a celestial. The opinions of what these were varied from one group to another. An alien race, a humanoid beast, an experiment from one of the groups… but they were all far off the mark, and if they really knew, it would be almost impossible for humans to comprehend and it would cause deep fear in them.

The stir had even caused popular news channels to create a hosting section. In a studio, there was a sofa at the back, where the host sat in his suit, and there were three more people dressed in regular everyday clothing who had come in.

One of them was a teacher, another worked for the Green party, and one of them was a member of Pure as well.

"Today, we invite our guests to talk about the new beings called the celestials. We have decided to get those coming from different groups to talk about how they feel about what we should do next on the matter?" the host asked, looking toward the teacher.

"I think the best thing to do is to find out what their goal is. If we can avoid a fight, it will always be best. Maybe we had done something to anger them in the first place." The teacher replied.

"Although I do agree with my fellow guest, I also think what is important is that all groups come together to fight this force if necessary." The man from the Green party replied. "Look at the clip that you saw. Zinon, the man who they are calling zombie boy and the others, including everyone in the city, had come together to beat the enemy.

"I think that it's important, if the attack continues, that we should put all our forces together."

The host was nodding along as he heard these words, but there was a scoff from his other side.

"Of course, you would say something like that." The man from Pure replied. "Don't you think the timing is a little too convenient? Pure had just had an attack, our base destroyed by one of our own, Chris.

"Yet there he is. On the video fighting against this new enemy!? If you ask me, all of this seems like a set-up. An imaginary enemy that was made just to distract you from finding out the truth. That damned Chris and all of them should be hanged for hurting the people!"

The discussion that was being broadcasted about the event had become heated, and it begged the question, was anywhere at this point and time being attacked by the celestials? If so, they would need to come up with a plan soon.

——

Unbeknownst to the rest of the world though, at the time the news hadn't just been spread to them, but it had been spread to the rest of the celestials as well. There were stations set up that allowed those to watch the current fights going on between celestials and God Slayers.

However, still if one was to get out of that space, they would be back to the real celestial space where time was far slower. This was why the news of what had happened to Hinto, had already been heard by everyone so far.

"This place is getting stranger and stranger by the day," Yongbu said. "After you said all those things about him, I thought Hinto had no chance to lose."

"I thought the same thing!" Xox replied. "Who knew that there would be those on earth that were close to the level of a God Slayer, and on top of that for a dedicated follower as strong as that to help out in the fight!"

"Which brings me to the question, why wasnt that one classified as a God Slayer. I would say it was because of him that the match was won. If it was only the God Slayer against Hinto I think it was clear who the winner would be." Yongbu replied.

"Exactly!" the ball of energy had risen with excitement. "The question you asked though, there is an answer for it. God Slayers are those that are strong enough to be classed as one with their own strength.

"A dedicated follower can be classed as at the God Slayer level. Although, we wouldn't typically call them one. However, if they are only that strong due to the energy that they have borrowed from a celestial, then it doesn't really count.

"Because in the end, kill the celestial, and all the dedicated followers perish after. What is strange is how such a person who isn't classified as a God Slayer could hold so much celestial energy like that."

The fight was aggravating for Xox, and what was worrying not just him but all of the celestials even more was that two of the fighters that had been taken out. Depending on how all the other situations went, there was a chance that the whole of the celestial space would feel very different once again.

It was clear that the celestials didn't like it, this pressure that was in the air, and they just wanted things to return back to normal, which was why all of them were somewhat routing for the celestials to get rid of the annoying God Slayers.

"I wonder what Mundus thinks of this?" Yongbu asked.

"A small hiccup." A voice from behind replied, when turning around they could see Mundus standing right behind them, which caused their energy forms to shrivel in size as they were both frightened.

Right there and then, they wanted to run off, but if they did, they knew it would be disrespectful, and they perhaps would be put in the reincarnation cycle next. However, even though they had no heart in this space, they were racing when looking at Mundus.

Although the two hadn't told each other, both of them feared that Mundus perhaps had found out about their involvement with the celestial in question that was causing part of this mess.

"I will explain to you, and I hope you can pass this on if anyone asks," Mundas stated. "The ancient ones are always thinking ahead. If Hinto failed it just means they have something planned for after that.

"There was a reason why these people were selected. I believe the strongest fighting celestials weren't chosen so we could gauge how big the problem is. As for Hinto himself, I believe it's so Immortui can get more involved.

"You know the ancient ones and him have a history and maybe sending Hinto was a way for them to communicate, and now with him gone. Maybe Immortui will make bigger strides to get rid of this problem." Mundus stated and continued to walk past.

# Chapter 1915 Writing A Book

Due to recent events, the small group that was responsible for taking out the new being that was known as a celestial, were unable to go around any of the Graylash planets without being recognised.

Peter had somewhat of a solution since he could transform his own looks and change Chris's appearance as well, but then what would they do with Laxmus. Which was why Zinon had offered for them to come with him for the time being.

They were heading towards the base of the Graylash, which was more so just a large piece of land that was floating through space. They thought they would also get their answer as to where the ship was seen heading in their section.

However, the group weren't alone as there were a few extra guests.

Currently sitting at a table on the medium-sized vessel, Lucia had her hands on the top of her head.

"Remind me why these three were invited here again?" Lucia asked.

The man sitting next to her had a grin on his face, and a tablet in hand, typing away everything that was happening so far. It wasn't an ordinary man. In fact, it was the incredible reporter that was known as Aj.

"One of the biggest topics that is going on right now is between you and Zombie boy!" Aj stated. "I won't film anything you two don't want to see, I'm just writing the observation I have, and besides, every time I try to talk to him, I'm scared I might get…hit."

Aj's eyes darted to the corner of the room where Peter had his arms folded and was paying attention. After eating food and collecting his limbs for him, he was back to the way he was.

During this journey, Aj was so amazed that he continued to ask non-stop questions about Peter, how his body worked, what that surge of energy was. In truth, Peter just ignored the reporter, not saying anything but then there was a certain question asked that rubbed him the wrong way, how did he feel about Lucia, that was the first time he had caught a reaction and words out of Peter, but they had sent a shiver down Aj's spine.

"If you keep asking questions, I'll punch you through the wall."

After those words, Aj stopped and decided to move his questions to Luica, who at first was open to answering some of them, but when it came to stuff with the celestials and more, she kept her mouth shut.

She was smart enough to know what panic this would cause the world.

"Don't forget that it was because of Aj that you guys were able to get out of there peacefully," Vanessa added.

As for the other two guests that had hopped onto the ship, as silently as they could, following Aj it was the vampire pair, Vanessa and Lucas. Since they had been a great help to Aj, and had given him the scoop of a lifetime, he had asked the two to come work for him as assistants, and the two of them were more than willing to.

They had always wanted a sense of adventure, but not quite one that would put their own lives on the front line, so this was perfect and they too were interested in this mysterious group.

"Yes," Lucas added. "Because of Aj reporting that he had seen you guys on the north side, all of those reporters that were waiting for you at the docking station rushed off, and we could sneak onto here with ease. So I think a few questions wouldn't hurt too much."

"You guys do have to understand a few things though," Zinon said, sitting at the metal table, and clashing his hands against the bottom making a clang sound. For Zinon, he hadn't gotten his arms back, instead he had made do with two bionic ones. They were somewhat common items that people could buy these days, and a procedure that could be done with ease.

At the moment, he just got the standard of the shelf stuff, but his best bet was to go to Green city after and see Logan himself to get the best of the best.

"This matter with the celestials is off limits. I don't mind you guys talking about your theories and such, but there is a line. From now on, I don't want any live broadcastings of what happens if you are to follow.

"On top of that, everything has to go through us before it gets out there to the public, and if anything extremely sensitive such as the location of them or you decide to secretly post something regarding the others online. The whole Graylash faction will be mobilised to get rid of you.

"And not even with your wealth could you hire Travellers to stop that."

Aj gulped. His integrity as a reporter really didn't want his videos to be censored or edited by others, but what choice did he have, which was why he just decided to nod.

Now that was over, Zinon's question went over to the others, and he looked at Chris, since he was the easier to talk to out of the two.

"I'll let you guys borrow a ship, and I'll give you the coordinates, but after that, what do you two plan on doing? Are you still going to look for Zero?" Zinon asked.

Aj's ears were burning up, but from the looks of things, this wasn't something he could report on. Still, right now he was happy that he was just present in the room.

'Zero, the leader of Pure. I guess it would make sense that Chris is after him, after all why would he attack his own base? Something must've happened and now he's travelling with one of the people that disrupted the Chained wedding. It's clear that there are many pieces to this, but as to what they were and how everything came together I don't know.'

"I know you are focused on this task, but that thing attacked you for a reason." Zinon reiterated. "Don't you think that they might be out there attacking others as well?"

"I have no doubt," Chris replied instantly. "But you also have to realise Zinon, that the human race has been put through a lot recently. We have grown in leaps and strides when it comes to strength. These guys thought it would be easy taking us out, but they were wrong."

Chris had said these words with such conviction and in his mind he had one person, Quinn. After facing him, he was finding it hard to imagine that anyone could beat him, god or not. In his head, he replayed if Hinto and Quinn were to fight who would win.

Although Quinn was less skilled, Chris had learned to not underestimate him because not only did he have a wide range of abilities and was versatile. He also improved the most when it came to it being in the middle of a fight.

"We have to continue," Peter spoke. "Because it's to help Quinn. We need to get as much of his plate as possible for him. That man has done enough for the world, so let's do this and let the damn person rest."

"Quinn?" Vanessa replied. "Are you guys talking about the great hero Quinn? Is that who you are doing this all for?"

She found it strange that they were trying to help a dead person.

"Even in that fight, he helped me," Peter stated, which raised more eyebrows.

"I don't think we have to worry about him," Chris said. "If any celestial comes for him, they would be the unlucky ones."

Things were slowly coming into Aj's mind as he was figuring things out. Out of nowhere, who could have come to such an event and disrupt the whole world? Once again, who were these strong people, world leaders like Zinon, able to help and work under, even to change the views of the Great Chris to betray the Pure Faction?

When thinking about it all, it was so simple, and at that moment, there was a ping on Aj's system. He opened up his screen, and one of his informants had delivered him some news. At the vampire crops base in Mars, vampires were claiming that Quinn had returned.

"Everyone!" Aj called out at that moment. "I know you said you didn't want me to film. You don't want me to tell the whole world of what is happening, at least not yet anyway, which is why I have a proposal.

"After this is all over… when you guys are done doing what you have done. I wish to listen to all your stories, listen to everything you have done, everything you have been through and record it.

"Maybe I can't make it into a documentary of some sorts, but perhaps a book, a book that can be passed on so the entire world continues to know of all your feats and everything you ever did!"

The others hearing this, they thought the idea of a book sounded pretty interesting.

# Chapter 1916 One Person On My Mind

When Zinon returned to the main Graylash planet, there was quite a reception from the old men, and the longtime members of the Graylash household. They had seen the videos as well and were deeply concerned for him.

However, with a big smile on his face, he made sure to not let anyone worry about him.

"I still have plenty of life left in me, and don't worry, I won't pass until I find out the truth," Zinon said.

This caused concern on some of the elders' faces for a few reasons, some of them just simply believed that Owen Graylash had died naturally and he hadn't been murdered. Only a few knew that Zinon claimed that he was searching for the truth.

Eventually, the whole group headed to the palace, including Lucia. She had wanted to stop by her household, but she wanted to stay with the others for a little while longer, at least before they left.

The group were walking through the palace and were heading to Zinon's room. Surely reporters wouldn't be allowed in such an area, but they had done so and Zinon had even given permission for AJ to film.

At the end of the day, his job was a reporter so he needed to give him a carrot once in a while. Otherwise, maybe he would just be tempted to spill the beans. In truth, Zinon felt like one day AJ would spill everything, but in a way, Zinon wanted the world to know about everything.

It was the people in the first place that had caused these numbers of problems, and it was the others above them that wished to control them.

"I know I could have just sent you guys the coordinates, but in truth I wanted to talk to you on the journey here about what happened. I thought there was a chance that it could have a relation to Owen.

"Either way, I also thought it was best I give you the information personally, as these days we don't know what could happen." Zinon explained.

The group had reached the courtyard, it was a beautiful garden with plants, and flowing water. At the very top floor it was impressive how they had such a thing inside of the palace. Something had caught Zinon's eye though.

"Can you guys wait for a second." Zinon stated as he walked towards the centre of the garden to the large statue that was in the middle.

He looked at his robotic arm and started to move his fingers in and out towards his palm. For a second, sparks started to gather from his shoulder and they began to swirl around the entirety of his bionic arm.

Then looking at the statue, he threw out his fist at a fast speed, bashing into it, causing it to crumble to pieces and fall onto the grass.

"Leader, what have you done!" An old elder shouted from the side as he saw this.

"That was the great Genbu statue, the one that had helped our beloved Owen."

"No." Zinon stated. "That damn Turtle now works for someone else, there is no need to have a statue of him here."

Not saying anything else, Zinon continued toward his room. The others understood, Erin now had Genbu and most likely, she was the one that played a part in killing Owen, at least, that was Zinon's theory.

The Elders had rushed to the broken pieces of the statue, picking them up off the ground.

"Stop, if anyone dares to put that statue back together, then I will make sure I never see them here again. There is a reason for everything I'm doing." Zinon continued, and the elders had dropped the pieces of statue there and then.

AJ was smirking at this, because everything had been caught on camera, and he thought in the meantime, while he couldn't live stream for a while, putting out bits and pieces like this would do them well.

After entering the room, everything was relatively quick, a ship had been prepared for Chris, Peter, and the other three who surprisingly, would be joining them, with the coordinates in hand.

"I wish you guys good luck on your journey, and if there is anything you need help with, stop by or send us a message. I will do my best to help you out, as long as it's no more dangerous fighting." Zinon chuckled.

Before turning around, everyone's eyes were on a certain couple. Lucia had approached Peter to say her goodbyes, her head was down and she was twiddling her thumbs nervously, while Peter just stood there staring at the wall on the other side.

It was hard to tell what his emotions were in all of this, especially by the reaction on his face.

"Peter, stay safe, you know I care about you a lot, right, and about before. If you really don't feel the same way, you can just forget everything you don't have to force yourself." Lucia stated.

She had survived without Peter before, so she was pretty sure she could continue to survive without him now as well. It was just, in the middle of everything, she never thought she would find a person she cared about so much, someone she wanted to look after, and it was the first time for her.

So she was hoping that the feelings would be responded back.

"Lucia." Peter started off his sentence. "For a long time, there has been only one person on my mind. Someone I care about, I think about all the time, and I wish they were always by my side. I would do anything they asked, and anything they wished."

Lucia, was starting to blush hearing these words , finally she was hearing what she had wanted, and it was all coming out so fast. Never in her life did she think she would hear Peter speak these words about her.

"I would even risk my life for Quinn."

Hearing that name, everyone's faces dropped in that moment, and Lucia felt like she had been stabbed in the heart.

'All of those words… They were for Quinn. I guess Peter really has only one person on his mind.' Lucia thought. "I understand, good luck, and I hope we can continue to meet."

The groups had split up and they were now flying through space once again. While in the ship though, Chris was curious about what he had just heard.

"Why… did you bother to tell Lucia all that, all that stuff about Quinn," Chris asked.

Both Vanessa, Lucas and AJ were curious as well.

"Because that is how I used to feel, but now there are two people in my mind from time to time," Peter replied.

"What!" Chris shouted back. "Then why didn't you say that to her? You made her completely misunderstand you."

"I was going to, but she had already said goodbye. The conversation ended, no need to continue, and it's not important."

Peter was certainly an oddball for them all, but that's what made him so interesting to follow as well. Any women that decided to stay with him, their life certainly would be a hard one they imagined, or perhaps a very easy one based on his loyalty to Quinn.

The group had eventually entered the new solar system of planets and there were large chunks of asteroids that were floating around some of the planets. They looked somewhat like moons.

Eventually, they had landed on the closest planet, and decided to stretch themselves for a bit.

"So, do you have any idea how you are going to locate this Zero person?" Vanessa asked. "There are so many planets, and some of them are gigantic it could take years to find them without a plan."

"Energy," Chris answered. "Zero uses a large amount of Qi when he fights, and I am used to what his Qi feels like. Out here, these planets were said to be dangerous, so if he's fighting, I can-"

At that moment, staring off into the far distance, a large explosion was heard. They looked into the sky, and like a moon another planet could be seen in the distance not too far from theirs.

A giant cloud, like a nuclear bomb had gone off, could be seen, and from here they eventually felt the wind and at the same time, the wave of energy that hit them.

"That's Zero… he's fighting on that planet!" Chris grinded his teeth and began to transform.

# Chapter 1917 Marpo Cruise Vs The Celestial World

In a solar system far, far away from Earth, on a planet that was once inhabitable, the celestial known as Tumoon had been sent there. The task that was set up by Mundas, the celestials believed that it to be an easy job.

Although not all of them had fought against God Slayers before, they had created a reputation for themselves as one of the most fight-centric gods with great strength and power. Unlike some that would just worry about their Celestial points or let things flow naturally, these Celestials were different.

They tended to rule the planets with an iron fist. Forcing the people to complete whatever their condition was. This style would often cause uprisings, those that grew in strength would try to overtake their oppressors, but the gods were still powerful and strong enough to deal with them.

It meant that the celestials always found their strength beyond those around them and would even begin to become complacent on new tasks and against new enemies. For Tumoon, since he had never fought against a God Slayer before, Mundas had sent him against a relatively easier opponent.

"The Godslayer that you have been sent after has done little to disrupt our plans. In fact, they have hardly acted at all, but they have left the area of Immortui's control. But this all does not mean we can just let them go. We need to teach these Earthlings a lesson and make sure they know their place."

According to Mundas, this was going to be a relatively easy task, and when arriving in the strange office-like building with glass surrounding everywhere with the human in front of him, Tummon thought the same as well.

So why, after everything that he had done, after all of the battles he had fought, why was he the one lying on the ground, with his entire body detached from his head. Slowly, his body began to disintegrate into the blowing air, turning into particles too small for the eye to see.

"This place…is too dangerous," Tumoon muttered before a large black foot stomped on his head, bursting it into dust and finishing the celestial off.

"That was strange." Pine, the Dalki said.

The room they were in was completely destroyed, all the glass panels around them were shattered, and there were several large holes through the building. Despite the material it had been made of, the building was actually meant to be resistant to attacks like these.

"Yes, you're right. He was harder and easier than I thought. The energy around him was interesting as well, I would have loved to have studied that." The red-eyed man said. "It was a being that didn't seem to be a human beast or even an alien, as if it was from some completely different place. It's a shame that Pine has turned his body into nothing but dust. Otherwise, I would have loved to have studied it."

"I didn't turn him to dust," Pine replied. "I thought you would want to do something like that, which is why I chose not to hurt him as much. If there is anyone you should be having a go at, it's the new H."

Everyone had turned their heads to a dark corner of the room, where huffing and panting could be heard. From the outline, the figure looked larger than an average Dalki, but it was the eyes that screamed signs of madness in them. Filled with anger and hatred, they stared back at them.

"You are far stronger than I thought." The human claimed. "This will do well, this will do very well."

——

Inside the celestial space, there was a word that another celestial had perished. There were rumours flying around that it felt like the God Slayers were becoming too big of a threat and that anyone who was being sent out was sent to their death because even Tumoon, who supposedly had the easiest task at hand, was defeated and turned to dust.

Mundas sat down on what looked like a chair that was made of the same type of energy as everyone else. It was attached to the floor and glowing. He seemed to be in deep thought as he reassessed the current situation while tapping his fingertips on the arm of the chair.

"Those who witnessed Tummon's fight, report to me what you saw. I also want to get in contact with the Celestials in the area and ask if they sensed any strange energy readings or if any strange happenings have been going on for a while around them."

After everyone who had witnessed the fight gathered in front of him and began to talk about it, Mundus had a grasp on what happened during the fight, but he still didn't quite understand. That was until he talked to those that worked in the nearby or the same solar system that the planet was in.

Soon, he learned the history of these people, the history of those that owned the Marpo Cruise line. Then on top of that, one of the celestials who was close by also revealed that he had sensed the energy reading of the fight while it happened. This had given him all the information he needed to know exactly what went wrong.

"The force behind Marpo Cruise seems to be extremely powerful, on the level where they could affect the whole universe wherever they went. What I find weird is that They have accumulated this much power and are just running a cruise line. That makes no sense.

"Wealth, money, resources, once these things are obtained, if one is not satisfied, they would never gather this much power. The only reason why someone would gather an army like this is to conquer. One thing is clear though, they have at least three people within their ranks who stand at the Godslayer level when it comes to strength.

"Maybe they have more, but we wouldn't know unless we run an investigation. For now, letting others know about this would just make them anxious. We need to focus on the current problem at hand and keep an eye on what these people are exactly trying to do.

"Perhaps, the two will take out each other, or one will take out the other, making them weak. Then we can get rid of all our problems in one." Mundas said as he stood up, and the chair underneath him vanished.

He wasn't going to report to the Ancient Ones that he had failed his task, not until the task actually failed. And there were still plenty of ways he could resolve the problems and get the upper hand.

——

Back on the planet where Tumoon had perished, everyone was getting over what had just happened. Both the human and the red-eyed man were walking down the hallway as they returned to the docking area where all the giant cruise ships were.

"Will this incident hamper our plans?" the red-eyed man asked. "It could be someone who we have angered. Perhaps they will be sending more."

"Let them send more, I think H on his own could have dealt with two of them, and Pine is equally as strong." The human replied. "On top of that, we have a whole army which we haven't revealed yet."

"We proceed with the plan. The Marpo Cruise will be suspended for business, and we are to proceed with our attack."

The red-eyed man had a large smile on his face when he heard this. Finally, after all this time, they would be going back to where it all started for them. However, there were too many enemies, too many to choose from.

"I will proceed with the opening of the chambers. I will be there with him so there will not be a problem. This will increase our strength two-folds, even more than before. Without fail, it will be impossible for us to lose."

"In the past, I would have said to be careful with those words, you could jinx us by saying something like this, but I agree." The man replied. "Which is why with our return, I will make a statement. Our first target will be the elimination of the Blade family."

****

# Chapter 1918 Sil The Great

The Blade ship was large and over the course of a 1000 years, there were now 1000 of those that had the Blade ability as it was passed down to their family members and more. On top of that, the Blade community had become more than just those from the Blades, it had more so become a faction.

Honestly, during the 1000 years, just like in the past due to their strong ability, the Blades were feared and felt like they were unmatched in terms of power. They hadn't directly got involved with the ongoing dispute between the Pure faction and the Green's but that was mainly because Logan had told them not to, due to the nature of the humans during that time.

Which was why, even though it was the first time the Blades had ever had an intruder be able to come aboard their ship, no one was scared and was ready to take them on. However, possibly the strongest Blade in existence was frightened.

"Step back!" Sil shouted immediately to everyone as he recognized the energy in front of him, the energy of a celestial.

The one that had claimed to be called Kipo, was the celestial that had been tasked with taking on Sil. The one known as Kipo had a human-like body, there was currently no clothes or armour on himself and only his smooth skin could be seen.

It was solid white in colour, with a few black patterns over his arms and legs making them somewhat look like tribal tattoos that had been placed on his skin. His eyes were also a solid black which made them stand out due to the contrast against his skin.

It was hard to tell from just looking at the figure if they were strong or not, and although Sil could sense celestial energy from this one, how much it was hard to say.

"Sil, are you really worried?" Borden asked, surprised by his actions. "I mean, you haven't been with us for a while, but with all of us we can take this one on."

"We should listen to Sil." Vorden said, as there was an uneasy feeling he could sense from the person in front of him. "If Sil is worried, he must know something, so everyone should be cautious."

Sil had every right to be worried. Although he had beaten celestials before, after the last one, he had come to the conclusion that not all of them were weak. Taking out Athos took him and Quinn together.

Right now, Quinn wasn't here, and it was the first time that a celestial had come to him. If they knew about him, knew who he was, and what he did, he couldn't imagine anyone they would send would be weak.

'I can't get the image that I saw out of my head. Logan was right, it was a bad idea to look into the future, but what if this is the future I saw. Maybe I would have never come back, and everyone here would be dead… I can't risk it… I can't risk these guys getting hurt.'

Placing his hand on the ground, a large portal had been made, and soon the celestial, Sil, Vorden, along with those that were in his mind, and finally Borden had sunk through. The next second they saw themselves rising and had appeared somewhere completely new.

There were trees, large meadows of grass but at the same time patches of what just looked like a dull land of rock. When looking up as well, there wasn't much of a sky, and you could see space pretty clearly.

"Where are we?" Vorden asked.

"Somewhere it doesn't matter if we go all out." Sil replied as he had opened his book changing his abilities and getting ready for combat.

Currently, they were on one of Mars' moons. It had a total span of 3000 miles, making it far smaller than a planet. The good thing was, the moon had been used as a practice run for terraforming which was why there were plants and insects but no other life, no one lived here which was perfect.

"Alright, well I guess it's just going to have to be us three that take on this guy huh." Broden said with a smile, as he had transformed his body into more of a Dalki, as the scales appeared more vividly on his face.

"Actually, I don't think I'm going to be able to fight in this one." Vorden said. "It might be best if I stay out of it. I don't have any useful abilities at the moment, none strong enough to take out this guy, and besides I know I would just get in your way."

Truth was, it was an accident on Sil's behalf bringing Vorden, but if it was just one person it should be enough for him to protect.

"Are you done?" Kipo asked. "I was kind enough for you to let you change our fighting area. If this is more comfortable for you, then it means it is more comfortable for me as well."

For some reason this celestial seemed to have manners, but that was just making Sil worry even more, as it meant it had great confidence.

"My only task was to take you out. So let's begin shall we."

——

Of course, there was a couple that were following the fight closely, as they had been following all of the fights.

"The celestials keep losing, do you think it will be the same with this fight?" Yongbu asked. "I mean, this is the God Slayer that has been giving everyone the most trouble, the most worry, and perhaps the one that even started all of this mess to begin with."

Although Yongbu didn't say anything, he had also met this one in person, and he seemed to have a lot of tricks up his sleeve. All of his dedicated followers had perished, and fairly easily, as well.

"You should know Kipo." Xox replied. "Although before we talked about Hinto being one of the most dangerous celestials, he certainly isn't the strongest. There are many well known fighting celestials in this space that have a name, and Kipo is one of the strongest ones."

Even Yongbu had heard of Kipo's name, and that was impressive for the celestial space with how many celestials there were, but he still had focused too much on his own planets to know why he was so menacing.

"You have to remember what you just said. Of course Mundus knows that this God Slayer is dangerous. After seeing him fight against Athos, no one would send a weakling after him and Kipo is not a weakling by any means." Xox explained. "Many might not know this because it has been so long, but there are two things that everyone should know about Kipo. One is that he wasn't a born celestial.

"Similar to Athos, he wasn't a born celestial but had become one. This in itself means that he had been through a lot. As for his tale of how he became one, I do not know, but as for the second fact, although this might not be impressive to many, Kipo has never had to go through the reincarnation cycle.

"He has lived for a very, very long time, never having to experience death once. Usually, celestials are foolish and get carried away due to their powers to be reborn. Some even choose to go into it.

"However, you have to understand that Kipo was there during the white war."

Hearing this, Yongbu finally understood, what he meant, why it was impressive that Kipo had never reincarnated. The white war was the only war to ever have occurred in the celestial space in the past.

"Without a doubt, out of all of those that had been sent to hunt the God Slayers, Kipo is one of the strongest among them, and might very well be one of the strongest fighting celestials as well. Unlike the others."

# Chapter 1919 Untouchable

When starting a fight against someone of a certain caliber, there was always something that had to go through Sil’s mind, and it was what set of abilities he was to use. At first there were always standard abilities that he would use to fight against his opponents, safe bets such as the lightning power that the Graylash family used.

Of course, one of the strongest things he could do was make clones of himself and fight that way, but that took up a lot of MC cells, which was why he had to test the water. Thinking this, Sil had formed lightning around both of his arms, it sparked and condensed, forming two light blue tornados on his hands, but eventually that had condensed down even further into pure blue solid lightning bolts.

It looked somewhat similar to when Zinon used his soul weapon, only these were pulsating with power, and a shine could be seen over the entire area, lighting up nearly everything around them.

“Oh, no wonder the others were quite scared of you.” Kipo said. “I can tell that you have a lot of power, and this is just the first attack, but you should be careful to go all out, especially against someone like me.”

Kipo started to walk forward; it was the first time he had moved since being teleported to the area, but he didn’t run nor had he sprung any type of attack.

“Just give me the word Sil. I’ll do my best to follow your lead.” Borden stated, meanwhile Vorden had already run quite the distance away and was currently hiding behind one of the large rocks on the planet, not that he thought it would do much.

Throwing both lightning bolts, a loud bang was heard, thunder had been created just like a real lightning strike, and faster than most eyes could see, both of the bolts had been flung straight across, hitting Kipo directly.

However, after the loud bangs, and the flash of light there didn’t seem to be anything else. Kipo continued to walk forward, not a scorch mark on his body, and not having slowed down a single bit.

“What happened, did the attack miss?” Borden asked.

“No, it hit perfectly, don’t act yet Borden, not until we know what is up with this guy, let’s just stay back and let me attack from a distance.” Sil ordered

Sil was sure his attack had hit, but for some reason it had done nothing. It had touched the celestial’s body and had done nothing. While still using his lightning powers, Sil had created giant lightning whips and hammered them down over his head.

Lifting his arms up, Kipo had grabbed onto them, and was now holding them in place, in his hands like they were nothing. Changing tactics, Sil had created a portal, and teleported himself right above where Kipo was.

A fist of flames had been created aiming straight for Kipo’s head, but of course, Sil wasn’t just going to use a small amount of flames. An entire mountain of fire had erupted behind his arms, propelling his fist forward like a rocket.

At the same time, the edge of his knuckles had been condensed with flames to the point where they were no longer red and it was almost a white bright shining color. As the fist slammed into Kipo, the ground erupted around chucking up stones, and the nearby green area was burning to pieces, riling up just due to the intense heat.

Once again though, Kipo had raised his arm up, and had blocked the punch. He was just as fast as Sil, but that wasn’t the problem, it was the fact that the flames were doing nothing, the celestial didn’t look to have any strain on his face as he blocked the attack, or take on the intense heat that would have been able to melt nearly anything.

‘Is it his skin? Is it just a tough hide that is resistant to heat? But the lightning didn’t work either, maybe it’s an ability instead.’ Sil thought.

Since the attack wasn’t working, Sil had quickly teleported away before the celestial could do anything. Lightning hadn’t worked and neither had fire, two of the big four powers of the past, surely out of the large arsenal of powers he had, something would work against the celestial.

A tornado of sharp, deadly cuts was thrown out toward him, but he continued to walk forward. The deadliest acid had formed into a snake that gobbled up his entire body, and yet still, there wasn’t a mark on Kipo’s body.

Drowning Kipo in water by having his head stuck in it for a few minutes as he went around, and still there was no reaction forma he celestial instead, as it just continued to walk toward him. Sil had continued to go through a number of different abilities, using all his strength as he conjured the strongest attacks he could think of, and yet, not a single one had worked, and still Sil couldn’t discover what powers the person had in front of him.

‘Nothing is working, how can this be, even when fighting against Athos, these attacks would work.’ Sil thought. ‘I have to keep trying. I have to figure out what this person can do, otherwise it’s going to be the end of the Blade family.’

Vorden, who was watching everything by the side, was impressed, impressed at how strong Sil had gotten. The whole area the two were in, it had completely been destroyed and crumbled to the ground and such powerful attacks had been made Vorden was sure that the moon had been pushed out of its original position.

Sil was more powerful than ever, he had fought multiple times and knew how to use his powers well, better than anyone but maybe Sil still had a lot to learn when it came to things such as figuring out his enemies. Maybe during his time fighting on his own, he just had gone against many that he didn’t need to use his head so much.

The problem was, what was the answer to this fight? Because even Vorden didn’t know.

‘Even when I use my future sight ability, all I can see is this damned celestial continue to walk forward at every single one of my attacks.’ Sil thought, and it was starting to cause him a lot of concern.

“That’s it, I’ve had enough, I can’t just stand here and wait all day!” Borden shouted, as he charged in for the first time. Large amounts of the land had cracks beneath his feet as Borden drew all his strength into one hit.

A punch had been thrown toward Kipo’s head and it had been dodged, but the impact of the punch had destroyed nearly a kilometer of trees behind what was left of the trees after the continuation of Sil’s attack.

However, Borden had used his tail to whack the feet of Kipo unexpectedly causing him to trip, and while falling to the floor, Borden grabbed both of his hands and hammered down Kipo into the ground.

A grunt was heard as he crashed deeper into the moon breaking off more chunks that went so far that they started to float off into space. However, Borden’s hand had been grabbed, and soon his whole body was lifted as he was the one that was slammed back into the ground as well, and a kick had followed as he was stomped over and over again.

“Stop that!!” Sil shouted as he charged over as fast as he could using his speed, then gathering his Qi, and using a strength ability, Sil had hit Kipo right in the gut, sending him off into the distance and into the sky.

He was sure that Kipo wasn’t dead, and he would be back any second now. Getting off the ground, Borden wiped away the green blood from his mouth.

“That guy can definitely punch well,” Borden said.

“Yeah, but thanks to you I think I’ve figured out a way to beat this guy. This celestial, he must be resistant to elemental attacks. His skin, it just absorbs everything but when you hit him, it was the first time he had reacted.

“If that’s the case, then it’s time to go straight to the next plan,” Sil stated, as he started to arm himself, and each one of them pulled out their items, including Sil, with his trusty and special Trident.

“If it’s a physical fight, then I’m not lacking in that department either.” Sil smiled.
