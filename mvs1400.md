# Chapter 1400 - Final Message
With the live stream concluded, there was a lot of talk about from the netizens. The public couldn't stop talking about the new V that had appeared. Some were already comparing them with the old big four and the head generals.

Eventually, conversations started to spring up. If there were ever a war to begin between the two races, would the humans be able to win. Conversations about how long the V's even existed were starting to come into play.

However, some were more rational; if V's had existed for a long time and were this strong, then at any point and time, especially before humans had discovered they had abilities, they could have ruled over the humans, yet they had not.

Perhaps, it was because like Quinn, all V's were originally human at some point, and this was a mutation. Some people even saw it as a type of ability. Especially since their appearance, it has certainly made them seem more human on the outside.

Regardless of all these facts, it had caused a stir within the Earthborn group, especially among those who were part of the Board. They had decided to call a meeting, including Supreme Commander Sach, to discuss the new information they had gathered.

This wasn't the only thing that others were talking about. After discovering Helen's death, stories of her accomplishments and the tales of her kindness towards her people started to spread online. People were learning just how great of a person she was and how big of a loss to the human race this was.

On the Cursed Faction ship, two people in particular felt worse as more news started to spread. One of them was Layla, who had yet to leave her room ever since discovering what had occurred after she was taken away.

'She… she stayed behind when she didn't need to… she was so brave. She knew she was going to die if she stayed behind, and she still told us all to leave. Why… do people who are around me keep dying.' Layla started to sob once again with her hands covering her face.

It wasn't the first time she felt like this. When Erin was taken away, when Cia had died, when her mother had died, and now Helen. Each time, Layla had been somewhat close, but she was too weak to do anything, and this time too, she was too weak to help.

'If only I had succeeded in learning the Soul weapon, or learned to use Qi better, then maybe I could have done something…' These thoughts plagued her head. Every time she thought she had improved, more people were fading from her side.

'If Quinn were there instead of us…he probably would have been able to save her.'

At the same time, another person who blamed Helen's death on himself just as much as the others was Sam. In the end, he had decided only to send three people to help out the Daisy faction.

'Why didn't I send more. Maybe more people would have been able to stop the enemy. Maybe then Helen wouldn't have had to stay behind. Or I should have asked all of them to move as soon as the Dalki appeared.

'I should have been the one to order them to head back to the other planets.'

The thing was, Sam knew that would have been a bad call at the time as well. Dealing with an influx of people while all the Shelters were under attack - if he had chosen this option from the get-go, it was highly likely that they could have lost two shelters that day.

'Someone destroyed the teleporters after nearly everyone made it through, was that Helen as well. Did she destroy the teleporters to save the lives of the others?' He wondered.

——

Taking a deep breath and sitting down in the chair, Quinn had directed that no one disturb him for the time being. It was time for him to watch the video. He had been putting it off because it felt strange to him.

He had just seen Helen's dead body not too long ago, and now he would be hearing her voice and her words as if she was speaking from the other side. Still, he felt like she had left him this video for a reason, so he should watch it.

Playing the video, a large hologram displayed in front of him, and Helen appeared, sitting in the very seat on which Quinn was at this moment.

She had a bright smile on her face and looked in good condition, a great contrast to what he had seen her just moments ago.

"I hate that I'm recording one of these… but I guess as a leader, I need to lead by example, right? I can't tell all the others to make one and then not make one myself." Helen said. Her voice showed her nervousness, a side that Quinn hadn't seen from her.

"Anyways, when making this video, I needed to decide who would be best to see it. I have spoken to my sisters many times before, and they know how I feel, so I started to think… if I didn't get the chance to talk to the person, if there was someone I wanted to talk to one more time before I leave, who would that be?

"In the end, I came to my answer, and that is you, Quinn Talen. When I first saw you, I remember thinking of you as a young and naive man, but you had this determination, this look in your eyes to change things, and I was attracted to that because it was the same for me.

"I have an inkling for meeting these types of people, and for the first time, I thought I had met someone who had more ambition than me. You might not have realised this, Quinn, so I wanted to tell you.

"You might have more ambition than anyone I have ever met before. The reason why others and maybe you yourself don't realise this is because, for once, unlike other people, your ambition isn't selfish. This selfless desire attracted me towards you, and I thought, what would it be like if I spent the rest of my life with this person.

"I could imagine you as a great person who, if you truly loved me, would have done anything for me. You would have got up every morning to see me smile because that's just the type of person you are, and that's when I realised… your eyes didn't look at me in that way.

"At least, not yet. I'm sorry, Quinn, I'm sorry that I hesitated when I found out what you were. I started to think my initial attraction to you was something else, that maybe you had tricked me. Because for me as well, I had never felt these feelings of true love or love at first sight, I thought it was a myth. However, it was only later that I realised these feelings were real.

"I wish that I could have seen the world that you will create. I would have loved to travel on different planets with you, exploring new worlds and different views together. It would have been great, but I guess if you're watching this video, I will never experience that."

Helen paused there for a second, and Quinn could see a tear roll down her eye.

"I'm not like you, Quinn. I'm not a selfless person. I wanted you for myself, but in my aims to improve myself and be a person you would approve of, I decided not to be selfish. If this video arrives in your hands, I want you to enjoy those views; I want you to spend the rest of your life making someone else smile and experience these new feelings with others.

"And if you ever did fall for me, or realise you're feeling too late…then forget about me, Quinn Talen. This is my selfish request. Forget about me, and carry on with your selfless ambition."

The video ended there, and just like earlier, when he saw Helen, he didn't know how to feel.

"You…really are a selfish person. I remember when you just kissed me out of the blue…but you aren't a bad person Helen. Maybe I did realise too late…"

After thinking things over for a while, Quinn decided to do something and called Bonny.

"Bonny, get ready to film something. I'm sure they will be watching. I want to make sure this is something that the Dalki will see, my message to them!" Quinn said.

# Chapter 1401 - Young Anger
As soon as Bony and Void got the call that Quinn wanted to announce something, every cell in their body was shaking with excitement. It was rare for Quinn to call on them, and the last time he did, they had witnessed something special.

Shortly after, like last time, Bonny and Void had announced to everyone that there would be a special broadcast to take place. This had caused a slight problem that had put the whole world on standby.

The announcement had been made that Quinn wanted to speak to the entire world, yet he didn't give any date or time. Actually, it was because Quinn himself was conflicted on when exactly he would need to call him. There were various things that needed to be ready before he could act, and he had no clue how long those things would take. In the meantime, the two of them just had to stay put in the Shelter until Quinn called them.

Of course, with this pent-up excitement, the reporters couldn't just sit around doing nothing, and the only people there besides Quinn were the two sisters and the leaders.

They had already done their fair share of talking to them, and the sisters weren't exactly in the best moods to talk either.

Because of this, at the moment, Void and Bonny were outside of the Shelter, strolling around, trying to see if they could spot one of the leaders to talk to.

They moved fast, so it was hard to keep track of them, and they weren't even sure if they would be able to track them down.

"Do you really think this is a good idea? Those leaders, as Quinn described, are a little scary." Void mentioned.

It wasn't Quinn who had updated Void and Bonny on who those strange people were, but instead, it was Sam. He thought since the world had now learned about the existence of these powerful vampires, it would be nice for Bonny to make a detailed report at some point.

Of course, he couldn't go into too much detail because he was unaware of how much information the vampires would be happy to share, but the good thing was, Sam had the King of vampires on his side. If he overstepped his boundaries a little, who would be the one to tell him off.

He just told the basics, that the vampires were made up of a council who made the decisions for them. These were the council members—some of the strongest vampires that ruled over the others.

"You know what the situation will be like," Bonny replied. "I'm sure you read some of those comments online. If we are going to make a report about them, we need to calm those comments too, and the best way to do that is to gather more information about them.

"Who knows, maybe you will see one of them healing an injured bird or something."

"Or maybe we will see them feasting on a human body." Void replied.

Eventually, after some time of roaming around, they spotted one of the leaders near the edge of the Shelter. This one looked to be one of the younger leaders and strangely had a cane in his hands. It looked odd because the leader seemed to have no problem walking.

At the same time, the young gentleman seemed to have a strange circular device in his hand. It wasn't anything they had witnessed before. There were engravings carved into the device and a crystal placed in the top.

The two reporters hadn't gotten close just yet; they were cautious and just watched the person for a while walking around until eventually, he started to lift the rubble effortlessly and chucked it over to the sides as if he didn't care about the place as a whole.

In the end, after clearing the rubble, the ground resurfaced, and the leader then placed the strange device on the floor.

"So now I'm just meant to stand here and protect this thing until the others are ready? this is so annoying, just like you insects!" The leader said aloud. As for who the leader was, it was none other than the first leader, Nicu.

"Do you think he spotted us?" Void asked as the two of them were hidden behind a pile of rubble.

"Are all humans this thick?" Nicu asked. "I can hear you; I can smell you. I knew you were there from the beginning. Just ask me what you want and leave."

The two reporters looked at each other, thinking whether they should go out and ask Nicu a few questions. After all, he hadn't hurt them till now, so he won't hurt them after the questions, right? Still, he did seem to be an aggressive leader; perhaps it would have been better to talk to one of the other leaders.

Then the thought occurred that maybe others might turn out even worse. Trying not to shy away, Bonny started walking forward, and Void turned on the camera, chasing right after her. He wasn't the best when it came to making decisions, but he would soon immediately follow Bonny if she were to go.

"I wanted to ask some questions for the report we are preparing on the leaders," Bonny said, carefully walking through all the rubble of the damaged structures. Eventually, she had reached the cleared space that Nicu had created.

"I see, so it looks like they have already made you somewhat aware of us," Nicu replied smugly. "Well, as he stated, I am the leader of the first family, Nicu Cain."

Since Nicu was being so polite, Bonny felt like she had no choice but to bow down, and Void soon followed.

"I wanted to ask you a few questions. Who is Quinn Talen to you, the vampire leaders? And earlier, you addressed him as 'your majesty', do you mind revealing how this came to be?" Bonny asked.

Hearing this question, Void thought that maybe Bonny was prying in too much. If the Cursed faction wanted to give this information, they would have already told them about it. Nevertheless, it was evident that she was being too meddlesome because the question seemed to annoy Nicu.

'I need to know. I'm sure Quinn is on our side, but are the rest of these council members on our side as well?' Bonny thought.

"Yes…Quinn Talen is an outsider. Unlike us, he was a human who was turned." When speaking, there was a clear disliking in Nicu's voice which was worrying the other two. This was what they were afraid of. "However…"

Nicu started to think back when Quinn had forcefully taken Arthur's weapon from him. In that instant, Quinn stated something that had touched him a little. He asked for him to be more like his sister rather than his father.

"The council has voted, and I follow the rules. Although I might not agree with where he has come from, he is rightfully our King. So I will follow his commands."

It was a satisfying answer based on their actions so far, it really did seem like they followed Quinn, and it seemed like even if they didn't like him, these leaders were for some reason, loyal to him. Rather than push for questions about the vampire's origins, and more about Quinn like she wanted to, she decided to ask about something else.

"The strange device that you just placed down. What is it?" Bonny asked.

"This? I guess I can inform you." Nicu replied. "All of the leaders have been given a device similar to this. The devices are to be spread out around the Shelter. Then when everyone is ready, we will inform Quinn. For now, I have to stay here to make sure the device stays intact."

Now looking at the device closer, it was definitely something Bonny had never encountered before. She wondered if it had anything to do with the announcement that Quinn would have liked to have made; it was at that moment that the receiver on Bonny started to vibrate.

"Are you ready?" Quinn asked. "The preparations are complete. It's time for us to send our message to the Dalki."

*****

# Chapter 1402 - The Movement
While Quinn had moved to the Beast planet solar system, the vampire settlement was still busy even without their leaders. A few days had passed since the leaders had been summoned, but the rest were assigned important tasks.

For now, the ones giving orders were the respective knights of each castle, as for who was giving them orders… it was none other than the new Royal knight, who was also busy.

Fex hadn't been summoned along with the others; instead, he was busy trying to coordinate all the information and tasks that had been left to him.

"Arghh, man, I'm really not suited for this stuff," Fex grunted as he sat down in a seat inside the Royal castle and gave out a big huff of air. Although many of the vampires in the settlement hadn't watched the broadcast, Fex had done.

The reason for the other vampires missing out on such a thing wasn't because they were disinterested. Everyone was a big fan of the new vampire king. They would have loved to see him. But it was due to the previous leaders. They didn't want the vampires to know anything about the regular human world.

Which meant they had no clue who Bonny or Void was or how to access their Livestream.

'Man, that was quite a cool moment he displayed, but it sucks about Helen. I thought the two of them suited each other more than the other one.' Fex thought.

Still, watching the Livestream only made Fex more frustrated, wishing that he would have been called as well, but he knew he had important tasks to do. Turning his head to the side, he looked at the person who stood there.

By his side, there was another vampire. One that he had only recently gotten familiar with.

It was a female vampire. She was young in terms of vampire age but was far older than Fex. She had short hair and a blindfold that was constantly covering her eyes. It appeared she was visually impaired, something that was extremely uncommon among vampires.

Due to their healing aspects, vampires could heal nearly any condition that came upon them. Still, there were times when vampires were just born with certain disabilities compared to others, just like humans. And for her, it was her eyesight.

'Well, at least the girl isn't bald like another certain vampire.' Fex thought and chuckled to himself quietly while looking around to see if he was nearby.

'Sir, I have just received an update from the Fourth family and the Ninth family; it looks like preparations are finally complete.' The girl spoke, but she didn't do it aloud; she had said using her ability to send a message directly to his head.

This was the power of the Eighth family, The Snacker family. Although, Bryce had disbanded the family after they had somewhat supported the second family. Quinn had decided to bring the family back slowly.

He thought their ability was important for the vampires. A way to communicate with each other without relying on technology was a handy thing; they realized its importance even more than before because the Dalki technology was more advanced than theirs.

This was why currently working under Fex, was a girl named Saya Snacker.

"Where are they able to find Nest Crystals?" Fex asked.

It took a while for Saya to reply, which Fex just assumed was her trying to communicate to the others. Surprisingly, Saya's ability was quite strong despite her not being a vampire trained to take the hier position. Fex sometimes wondered if it was due to her visual impairment. Perhaps her condition made her focus more on using her ability.

"Not yet, they will continue to investigate for the time being, but they are already sending over the Crystals needed," Saya reported.

This was good news. Fex was waiting for these specific type of bat crystals that they would use to create the special rings that allowed vampires to stay out in the sunlight.

There was still another problem though, the rings that were created from these crystals only blocked the sunlight for a few hours. It was a temporary solution, and for the time being, the vampires would have to stay indoors until Quinn came up with another solution.

In all honesty, Fex thought they should have waited longer before Quinn did what he was planning to do, but something had clearly happened that Fex was unaware of, which had angered Quinn, causing him to speed up the process.

A few more days had passed, and the rings had been made. They were then handed to each of the vampires, and a report was sent to them all, getting ready for what was about to happen next. Fex had also gathered the people during that time, as he had something of his own planned.

At the same time, Vampire Knights were sent to different corners of the settlement, and strange circular devices were placed all over the settlement.

Now, there was only one more thing to do. Fex walked down with the Vampire Knights from each of his families by his side. They had entered the tunnels located beneath the castles. Accompanying behind them were a large number of crystals taken from the Royal storage room.

Finally getting through the tunnels and having one of Muka's newly appointed vampire knights, they unlocked a combination to a particular room.

'I never knew this place was down here.' Fex mused, looking at what was happening in front of him. He knew some tunnels led to the tomb area and each of the castles. There they had multiple cellars.

This was because he had been held prisoner in these tunnels at one point. Still, in the centre, under the pooling area, he was unaware that there was another large space. When they entered, Fex could see a large circle on the ground. It wasn't a technological device. It just looked like a painting on the floor.

Someone had drawn several patterns and shapes in the circle, and characters he had no way of interpretation.

"What is all this?" Fex asked.

His sister, being the vampire knight of the thirteenth family, was currently with him at the time.

"You know why we are here, Fex." Silver replied. "This is the transportation device, although if you're asking what exactly is that, I am not sure. You would have to ask one of the Originals about it. It was just created so we could move the vampire settlement whenever we wished."

Fex stopped his questions there. He would rather not ask one of those originals for help. It seemed like whenever one of them was awakened, there was trouble, and that included the apparent good ones like Richard Eno.

"Saya, report to Quinn, tell him we and everyone are ready," Fex ordered.

After turning on the device, it would take a while to charge, and Fex needed to get his plan in motion as well.

-

After reaching this news, Quinn stood on top of the base. He looked far out and could see the leaders already in their positions with their hands raised. In front of him, Bonny and Void were now standing on top of the base as well. Behind them were Peach and Ivy. They had a casket that contained Helen's body inside.

When the two of them were ready, they gave Quinn the thumbs up.

[Summon]

It was then that all the leaders that had spread out around the Shelter, just like before, had appeared right by Quinn's side like some magic. Even the leaders couldn't get used to this. They were being forced to move against their will, but quickly they stood on either side of Quinn while he remained in the middle.

The red light on the camera could be seen rolling.

Standing there, Quinn looked directly into the camera.

"I have a message for everyone out there. The Earthborn Group, the Graylash group, Members of the Cursed faction, and all of those that are still on Earth. Lastly, I have an important message for you as well, the Dalki."

When saying the name Dalki, Quinn's eyes started to glow red with anger, and at that moment, they would receive his message loud and clear, including Graham, who was watching the broadcast, waiting to see what this message exactly held.

*****

# Chapter 1403 - The New Settlement
Once again, Quinn was making another impression on everyone. He didn't realize that he had also influenced the fighting that was going on the other planets.

During the time between the announcement was made and now, something special had occurred. After the Dalki had learned that Humans had reclaimed the Daisy faction planet from them, they decided to be somewhat patient.

This signified that most of the attacks that they had planned to orchestrate on the other planets were postponed. Those still on the planets were no longer pushing forward.

Although, Sach and Owen thought this wasn't good news either. The Dalki might have just been waiting for something themselves. They were always cautious but, at the same time, still not strong enough to go on the attack either.

Their fears were slightly true. The Dalki were focusing on increasing their forces at the moment. Before, they were on a time scale. Knowing their lives would come to an end at some point. But now, having one of the dragons, their situation had somewhat changed. So when Graham heard that Quinn had wanted to make an announcement, he decided to put things on hold.

For the last week, it felt like the treaty that was agreed upon between the Dalki and the humans had returned, and now, the person who had caused it all was about to address everyone again.

This was how much power Quinn had gained in that time. Just a simple announcement from him had managed to calm down the war.

On top of the base, everyone could see not just Quinn on the camera, but the leaders were standing behind him also. They stood straight and still, but what was gaining all the viewers' attention was Quinn's eyes.

They were burning after he had said the words Dalki. They could feel the anger in them even through the screen.

"The Dalki have taken many of our lives, our loved ones, and we are still in the middle of this damned war." Quinn clenched his fists "Even now, they have taken people close to me, members of the Cursed faction.

"It was because of them during the first war that I lost my parents, and then friends and others continued to die around me, and now the Dalki continue to do so.

"I'm sure many of you feel the same, and the truth is at the moment, we are losing this war. We have been pushed back to the point where we can't even leave our shelters safely. Is this the type of life we imagined? Even if we were to survive living like this, how long? How long would we last? Is this really a life worth living? For me, it's not. If we sit and do nothing, then eventually, the Dalki will win. All we would be doing is delaying what we know is coming.

"When speaking to you all last time, I talked about what we were. I admitted to you all that there were many members of the Cursed faction who were different to you. You gave them the name of V. It took a while but eventually, some of you accepted us. You accepted us through our actions, which was why I decided to show you. That these people beside me, their actions speak louder than words.

"Right now, the people who stand behind me are the leaders of the V. I won't lie; we know that there are some V that are working with the Dalki, but the ones behind me are different.

"The Humans, and the vampires, next to me, we both have a common goal. The vampires had chosen not to interfere in human affairs for a long period of time, but now there is something that threatens both of our species, and that is why they have decided to come out of the shadows, and this time, they, along with me, will help fight the Dalki."

When Quinn was speaking, the scene felt and sounded familiar to them. This was because, to the world, they had witnessed something similar happen before. It was when the first set of Originals had appeared. Those with abilities.

When the Dalki was invading the Earth, it was at its toughest times. Those with power had stepped forward, offering to help and teach others, fighting back the Dalki invasion. Once again, it looked like history was repeating itself with the so-called vampires.

"I know some of you will be frightened by these people by my side. I was at one point, but I, Quinn Talen, guarantee you that they will not harm you, and using their powers, using my power, we will get rid of the Dalki for good.

"Now that my message to the people is concluded, I will spare a few words for you, Dalki. I hope you are watching and listening to everything I say."

This time, even Sam was nervous about what would happen or what Quinn's words would entail for the rest of the world. Unlike in the past, Quinn hadn't asked Sam for advice on what to say. This time Quinn was acting on his own.

It was clear, Quinn was angry, and although the speech seemed somewhat soft in its approach. He wasn't asking the humans to work together with the vampires. He was particularly telling them what he would do.

Quinn turned to Muka and nodded her way. In her hands, she had a larger, circular device that looked similar to the small ones that Bonny and Void had seen in Nicu's hands; only this one was about three times the size.

Turning the dials around a few times, Muka then pressed on top of the crystal in the centre. At that moment, several lights positioned in different places could be seen in the shelter. Bonny and Void turned around and immediately told their drones to go up in the air to catch what was happening.

Just as they thought, the strange, almost bluish light they could see was coming from the smaller devices. The energy coming from them was so strong and bright they almost pierced the clouds. Then, the light from each of them started to spread out as if trying to consume the whole place.

Eventually, the bright light did just that, and soon, the light from each device overlapped each other, and the entire shelter was covered, including where the others were standing on the base. The feeling that everyone felt at that moment was similar to when they would go through the teleporters; as for where exactly they would end up, that could have been anyone's guess.

When the light finally faded, Bonny and Void found themselves in a strange room. Looking underneath their feet, they could see that they were now standing on a weird red carpet, and towards the very back, there was a throne.

"Film everything! Are you getting all this? I think we have just been transported to where all the leaders are from." Bonny whispered over to Void.

What was most impressive out of everything, though, was those that were in the room at the moment. All of the vampire knights had appeared, including Fex. They stood at the edge of the throne room in which others had teleported.

All were standing at an equal distance apart, lined up on either side. This clearly wasn't what Quinn had expected, and he looked towards Fex, who just smiled at him before lifting his hand and clicking his fingers.

'You want to make an impression right, well then you need one fitting for a King.' Fex thought.

At that moment, all of the knights in the room bowed down before going on one knee.

"We welcome back the family leaders and his majesty!" They declared in unison.

For a second, Quinn felt a little embarrassed at what had just happened due to its sudden unexpectedness, wondering just what Fex had made them do, but he had to quickly forget about that as he walked forward, regaining his composure.

Everything was still live, and his job was not yet finished.

"Come on… we're not done yet. There's still a lot I want to say to them." Quinn said, making sure Bonny and Void followed.

*****

# Chapter 1404 - No Fear, A Challenge
Everyone followed Quinn as he walked out, but he wasn't heading down the stairs or anywhere else; he was, in fact, walking towards his balcony, a space where the king would usually make a speech.

Upon reaching the balcony, Quinn looked down and could see all of the vampires had left their inner castles. They were now standing in the pooling area, all looking up at Quinn as if they were expecting him to make a grand speech.

Seeing them all there, Quinn found it strange. This was something he had never ordered; he just wanted them to be ready for the move, so he could only guess that it was something that Fex had arranged.

His hunch was right, and Fex had made sure to make everything more flashy than Quinn would have preferred.

The drones could be seen still in the air, which Void was surprised about. He thought that only they had been transported and figured they would be left behind. Still, he focused on the people below and filmed all of the architecture around them. They could see strange towers in places and the walls built with thick black material.

The castles, the walls, it looked like something they had never seen before, yet at the same time somewhat familiar. For instance, the Dalki fortresses that would be built had some striking similarities to these castles.

Before Quinn could even greet the people, all the vampires bowed down once again, and at the same time,

"We welcome your arrival, your majesty!" They shouted in sync.

Seeing this, Fex had the biggest smile on his face.

'It was a lot of work, and it took days practising this with everyone, but I think I have done a good job as a Royal Knight.'

Silver and the other vampire knights who hadn't followed were still in the throne room; upon hearing it, she just shook her head.

She felt like what Fex had done was a waste of time, but he insisted this was important for Quinn's plan.

It was then that Void noticed something with his camera in the distance, the sun that was out, and the fields they were on. The place looked oddly familiar.

"Bonny, I don't think we were the ones that were transported. I think that they transported this whole place to where the Daisy Shelter was."

They couldn't have been more right; even Ivy and Peach had been transported along with Helen's casket, which had been left in the throne room for now. They had looked at Quinn briefly before he moved to the balcony, and he gave them a nod indicating that it would be okay.

Seeing everything, those online were stunned in amazement; they had yet to figure out that the planet they were currently on was still the Daisy planet!

"Look at all those buildings; why does it look like something out of a period movie or something."

"There are so many of them. I thought there would be a few hundreds of V's, but their numbers are in the 1000s. Are they all as strong as the ones that we just saw?"

"I don't think so. He called them leaders. I'm guessing that guys are something special. Still, even the V's that we have seen so far are quite a bit stronger than normal humans."

"Let's not forget what they exactly eat as well; they feed on human blood. They see us as food. The only reason why they have probably decided to join the war now is so they can protect their precious food."

Honestly, Quinn didn't care what people thought of the place or the settlement; he was getting tired of always being cautious about how others felt. He was constantly pushing for good, trying to think hard about doing the right thing, and pleasing everyone.

During his time of rising to the top, meeting Paul, Nathan, Oscar, and even Vincent, he had learned it was impossible to please everyone. No matter how he did something, what way he did it, there would be those who were upset. So he needed to just care about the people he wanted to help, and this was the best course of action.

Before continuing on his message to the Dalki, he opened up his system screen and took a look; the title was being applied.

'It looks like it still works, this is excellent, and I have plenty of reputation points to use.'

Quinn then turned back to the camera, making sure Bonny had faced it towards him.

"You Dalki successfully took over this planet before, but you will never succeed again."

At that moment, using the system, certain areas of the settlement started to change. He moved his hands outwards, and the camera view switched to the drones above the settlement. The scene slowly changed, and a Great Wall began to form, bordering around the settlement, similar to what the Shelter had before.

Since the vampires were confident in dealing with whatever came their way, they never bothered to build walls around the Shelter. They did, however, have walls surrounding their inner areas near the castles.

Now, however, Quinn was making sure to build a high wall from the strong black substance around the entire Shelter. It was rising in milliseconds as if someone was using an earth ability, but this was clearly not an earth ability.

Once the wall was completed, Quinn then proceeded to add more things as towers similar to those staying outside the castle started to rise. Just by the tower walls.

This wall now protected the whole settlement, and lastly, gargoyle statues were placed on the outside of these walls. To make sure, any enemy who tried to attack would have a tough time. Bonny seeing everything, was left speechless.

They had never seen a power or an ability like this before; even the strongest earth ability users at most could build a large building or castle where they stood, but Quinn, from where he was, was able to create more, and they were complete structures that were definitely there for more than just show.

"This is the new Vampire settlement. Here shall Helen forever rests in peace.

"I invite you, the Dalki, Graham or whoever you are, to come here and try taking over this planet again. Try your best because I promise you, you will never succeed. If anyone attempts to take over this place, I will stop them.

"As long as I breathe, this place shall be protected. That's my invitation out to you… pathetic rats." Quinn held his head high as if looking down upon the whole race of Dalki!

Then placing his hand on the camera and clenching his fist, he destroyed it on the spot.

Void was at a loss for words, especially since his very, very expensive camera was suddenly turned into scraps. But with the Livestream ended at that point, Quinn had sent his message to the one person for whom it really mattered.

And, Graham had received it loud and clear.

"You think I'm scared? We will see, Quinn… we will see!"

# Chapter 1405 - Power Is Everything!
These days all the talk seemed to be about Quinn and the Cursed faction, and it was rightly so. They had been bombarded with all sorts of different news and with nothing else to do; of course, they would talk about it. For some, it was a big distraction from the current dire situations. Many of those who could fight had nothing better to do but write and surf online, while others were defending and fighting the Dalki.

Then some looked up to Quinn and his actions; many of them agreed with what he said about them already losing the war. They could feel it. Humans weren't stupid, but it was just a lot of them had refused to believe that such a thing was going to happen to them; in simple words, they were in denial.

Human lives are short, and it felt difficult for many people to digest the fact that the whole existence of their species might end in this generation. However, this caused a reaction from the two largest groups because they asked for their opinion on the matter.

On the planet which the Graylash group had practically made their home, a meeting was held. The reason they had chosen to settle on the said planet was due to the weather. Usually, the Graylash would travel on their large island-size ship. Still, they had decided to anchor it on the current planet and for the time being, stay there permanently.

It was filled with clouds and would more often than not rain and strike lightning every day. The type of weather others would have hated, making it one of the worst planets to live on. For them though, it was the best for the Graylash family. The best position for them to use their powers and defend from a Dalki attack.

The meeting took place in the Graylash chambers; it was an open area, where the sky above them was visible through a clear glass. All they could see through the glass on a day like this was a cloudy sky.

On the surface, where whatever light they had, shone on a round table, and here the top Graylash members were having a meeting; Grim, Hermes, Owen, and the respective group leaders within the Graylash family were present.

They had been talking for a while about other matters, but Owen knew this wasn't the reason he had been called and wanted them to get to the point.

"The people are asking every day about what our leader thinks of the Cursed faction." Hermes reported while standing straight, "They all know that you and Quinn have a close relationship. However, they want to know if you support Quinn, his Cursed faction, or do you support the V's that he has brought with himself."

While the other Graylash group leaders looked to be concerned about what was happening at the moment, Owen did not have any trace of worry and had a calm look on his face. As for Grim, he was happy to go along with his grandson's decision.

"Is that really what the people are asking?" Owen replied. "Aren't, in essence, all of those things linked. I said before, and my answer will be the same. All these people have doubted Quinn in the past, but when has the Cursed faction leader done us wrong?

"I'm sure the concerns that the people have, are the same ones that he has, but he has decided to act like he deemed fit because he believed it was the best course of action. We can't draw a conclusion based on the knowledge we currently have because we don't hold all of the pieces of the puzzle. Speaking rashly would be a silly thing to do, which is what everyone in the world is doing at the moment.

"The only person that knows all the ins and outs and has the picture of the full puzzle is Quinn. So what the people should be asking is whether or not I trust the V, and for goodness sake, let's just call them vampires. We treat the name like it's a curse if we say it. The question should be, do you trust Quinn? To which my answer is yes.

"Remember, there is a good chance that I wouldn't be here today if it weren't for him, my grandfather as well for that matter. I'm sure at the time, many thought what he was doing was wrong, but he chose to listen to himself, and because of that, the two of us were able to defeat Dalki and save everyone in this room.

"So now, I ask all of you a question, and you can ask the same to anyone else who is concerned about this matter: Do you trust me? Do you believe in my decision?"

"Of course, we believe in you, sir!" One of the leaders answered straight away. Just how Owen felt indebted to Quinn, nearly all of the Graylash faction now felt indebted to Owen as well. It was just hard for them to digest how much influence Quinn's actions had on everything.

"I'm telling you, what we should be worried about is how others will act. I can keep an eye on the Graylash faction, but I can't keep my eye on all the others."

——

Similar to how the Graylash faction was having a meeting after a very long time, those on the Board had also called for a meeting.

The Board was the one that was in control of the military. Practically what was left of the government rule, they were the ones who had decided to appoint the big four into their position of power, with their wealth and support obtained from the past.

They were the ten most powerful families, not in power but in influence and history. Nearly all these families lived on earth and chose to stay away from all the fighting that was currently taking place.

They decided to meet in one of the most expensive cities, Lotok City. It was a city filled with technology and sky-high buildings, surrounded by a reinforced wall as big as the skyscrapers themselves. On the walls were mechs that had yet even to reach the military's hands, and they were defending this city.

In one of the buildings was where neight old-looking people had decided to meet. The eight of them sat down in oversized brown chairs with a guard by their side who adorned top-class beast gear. It wasn't at the demon tier level, but the people and the gear were strong enough to deal with anyone they would meet in this city.

Two of the seats were empty, and the old group of people looked towards them.

"I'm assuming the Green family has refused to come again." One of them said.

"Of course, have you not heard they are part of the Cursed faction, which is the very same faction that is causing us all these problems. He is just a child in the first place!" Another was filled with anger.

"Yes, but his family did help support all the systems we use today and helped us rise to the position we are currently in. He is one of us, and we should respect that fact, but if he doesn't turn up, we will continue without him." Another replied.

The doors to the room opened again, and the others were expecting to see a member of the Green family or possibly the last person. That's when a man who seemed to be in his fifties and had a large orange-black beard on his face stepped in the hall.

Everyone instantly recognized him and had a smile on their faces, but suddenly they noticed something weird. This person was sweating at the moment and looked quite nervous.

"People, it seems we have a problem." He said.

The guard who was by his side stepped forward into view. He had no top on, and his body was riddled with scars.

"We have been wanting to talk to all of you for a while; it's a shame that we had to meet this way finally," He smiled.

It was Chris.

# Chapter 1406 - Pure The Puppet
All of those who were part of the Board at all times would have someone stand by thier side. This was their guard. Sometimes they wouldn't look too obvious as those who were members of the Board weren't made public. Only other board members knew of each other.

High ranking officials and the seats knew of them, but to the public, they had no clue there were such powerful families behind the scenes of things.

This was why if they were ever to meet with anyone, they would bring along a guard who would stand by their side at all times. These were some of the best Travellers that cared about one thing more than anything else: money and power.

Although with strong abilities, one could rise into a certain position and obtain great wealth, that wealth wasn't enough for some. Those that were truly wealthy were the ones that were able to fill their pockets, creating an advantage out of any type of situation, and those were the members of the Board.

These guards would often change at times. So it wasn't uncommon for them to see a guard that they couldn't recognise.

But everyone in that room knew something was wrong when they saw that guard. They had no idea who this topless person was, who looked to be wearing next to no beast gear and only had a couple of weapons on his back. Yet, they could tell, by one of their members' reactions, something was wrong.

Still not aware of the situation, one of the gentlemen, who looked older than all the others, had decided to act. He had a hunched back, and one of his eyes seemed to be wounded from some fight. He raised his hand, giving a type of signal.

In an instant, the guard by his side charged forward and headed for Chris. This Traveller had a pair of daggers that started to glow green. His ability was one that was focused on speed, making him one of the fastest Travellers in existence.

Yet, when he took a few steps, they all saw that suddenly, the Traveller fell to the floor, and surprisingly, the large man did nothing.

"I came here to talk to you, but if you really want to fight, then I can do that as well." Chris smiled at them all and allowed the bearded Board member to tell them to take a seat. Seeing the smile, they knew it had to be this stranger that had injured the guard.

In all of their years of meeting up, they had never had such an incident take place before. Their meetings were held in secret, others didn't even know what the board members looked like, and for the first time, an outsider had attended a meeting, and it seemed like a strong one at that.

"Don't be afraid; it looks like you guys are going to have a heart attack any second now just looking at me," Chris said. "It would waste a lot of time if any of you were to die. All I want you guys to do is listen to my words."

The men looked at each other, some thinking about sending their guards all at once towards the man, but they felt like it was useless; no, they knew it was useless, there was not an ounce of doubt.

"Good, I go by the Name Agent 1, and I am here today as a representative of Pure." Chris declared.

All of their eyes widened as a sudden foreboding feeling overcame them as if their fate was coming towards an end and that whoever their successors or family members were would have to attempt to lead the future generation.

"We at Pure have a few conditions. We are willing to spare your lives and many of those close to you on earth. In return, we wish for you to… let's say, do our bidding in the meantime.

"While you guys are free to live your life as you have been doing, we would just have a few suggestions we would heavily insist on you making."

It was clear to them that Pure wanted to take control over the earth. But in doing so, they didn't wish to announce it to the public. They wanted to be like a puppet master, pulling the strings behind the scene.

The older gentleman, with the hunched back, started to laugh.

"Do you think we care about death?" The man said. "I have lived a long life; if you were to take me down, my family has hundreds more that can replace us. The Board is far more powerful than the people that you see here today. Your threats mean nothing."

Hearing this, the other members started to regain their confidence because he was right. Their Board was more than just a gore of people; it was everything they had built up—the system behind the system.

"He's right; this is ridiculous. We are at war right now, and Pure is threatening us. With your so-called power, why don't you help us take care of the Dalki!" Another gentleman shouted.

Chris laughed at this comment.

"Because we believe that this world is still a world not worth saving," Chris smiled, "Help you fight the Dalki and weaken our power, for what? So the world continues to operate the way it has always been? Do you even have any idea what our goal is?

"If a group is willing to take you out, then we will happily stand aside; the only thing we didn't foresee was a different problem, but don't get the wrong idea, there's a reason why you are still alive today. We thought it was easier to use you rather than get rid of you, but I guess you have to learn that you are not at the top like you think you are."

The old man knew it was a threat, but he looked unafraid. He had clearly been through a lot in life.

"Very well, kill me then." The man said.

"That was the response I was expecting from someone like you, but don't worry, I won't kill you," Chris shrugged, and placing his hand against his ear, he turned on his earpiece.

"Team 6, you're in charge of looking over the Watson family, correct? You may proceed." Chris ordered.

Chris didn't have to let the old man hear, but he wanted to, and he could tell there was a change in expression on the old man's face after hearing his family name.

"The Watson family, in the east, you guys used to own all the supermarket chains dominating the markets around the entire world. That's how you built up your wealth, but that isn't why you were invited onto the Board.

"It was due to a small invention that your researchers had come up with that is now used among everyone in the world, the food pill. A simple Pill would give everyone the nutrients and daily calories it needed.

"It was a perfect tool for the war scenario we were in and helped lower costs and production in other areas. Because of this, you became one of the most influential families in the world and became part of the Board."

It was at that moment while Chris was giving his little speech, a phone by the old man's side started to ring. His hands were shaky as he went to pick it up. For some reason, he felt nervous.

After listening to the phone call, and the information on the other end, the man dropped it on the floor, he was so shocked.

"You…how…?" Were the only words the man uttered.

"I'm sure you all will find out what exactly happened to the Watson family soon, and if you don't wish for the same fate to befall on your families, I suggest you follow our proposal. In the first place, we are here to talk about the V, we both want the same thing in this case, so it would be in your best interest to listen." Chris said.

Now, the other board members were more inclined to listen.

# Chapter 1407 - The Vampire Soldiers
At the moment, it was a weird situation for the Cursed faction group. Their members were stuck in the middle of a controversy putting them in an awkward position.

Still, most of them believed in their leader Quinn and the other leaders. The leaders had protected them and got them this far, and not once did they blame Quinn or the Cursed faction members even after Helen's death. Most of the naysayers had already left after they had revealed themselves as vampires.

Those who were alive knew how much they had struggled and how powerful the enemy was. However, their strange situation actually came due to Quinn's recent actions regarding the V. The settlement had been moved to the Daisy planet. As of now, there had been no activity on this planet regarding the Dalki.

A similar situation was on the other two Cursed faction planets as well. Still, the Dalki had control of the many beast planets that the Cursed faction used to own, but before creating a plan to stay in position or try to reclaim these planets, Quinn wanted to solve a few other concerns.

The Cursed faction was currently being led by Sam, while Quinn was busy leading the vampires in the settlement. Still, in truth, Quinn should be in overall control of both. He was currently in the Royal room sitting by a desk that looked out of a window on the settlement.

It was daytime, so many vampires had decided to stay inside, with a few heading out. The daylight was something that the vampires would have to get used to.

'At some point, I want the vampire settlement and members of the Cursed faction to unite; If we are going to use their power and fight together, it would be best for them to know people with whom they will be fighting; side-by-side with.' Quinn thought. 'The question is, how am I meant to do that. If I do things too hastily, it will cause problems, and I'm not really sure how much time we have.'

Training had already started for the vampires to get used to resisting the temptation of human blood. What Quinn didn't want more than anything was for the vampires to act out on the battlefield.

Quinn needed to convince the whole world that the vampires were on their side, but right now, it was easy for their image to be ruined, which was why Quinn was taking things slowly.

'I'm confident in the Vampire settlement defending itself if the Dalki attack, but can't I wait here forever.' Quinn thought. 'I have the other half of the dragon the Dalki want, and as long as I have it, at some point soon, they will need to come for me.'

As Quinn was thinking about ways to slowly introduce the vampires into the members of the cursed faction, there was a sudden knock on the room's door.

"Come in," Quinn responded.

To his surprise, of all the people that he was expecting to enter, it was Ashley - the current leader of the vampire soldiers.

"Your majesty, I wanted to speak to you about a few things. Do you have the time to spare?" Ashley requested.

"Please, don't call me your majesty." Quinn offered a seat to the soldier, who was even older than himself. In the past, Quinn may not recived such a high amount of respect from the person in front of him, but recent events had led to Quinn turning the tables. "I have enough of that from the vampires; besides, you're older than me, and you were close to Paul. Feel free to speak your mind."

Ashley looked a bit hesitant before asking, which made Quinn wonder if the request would be a hard one. Still, thankfully Quinn's current calm appearance had settled Ashley a little bit.

"Since your return, the soldiers have gotten a bit anxious." Ashley started to explain. "It has been a long time since we have been away from our families after we first came to the vampire settlement.

"They wish to know of their families whereabouts, their conditions, and lastly, they want to know if they can meet them again. Paul said that he had made a request… and that you were looking for ways to turn us back into humans."

It was true it had been around two years since the soldiers had last seen their families. And interestingly, they had come to Quinn at this moment. Perhaps this was a way that he could slowly introduce vampires from the settlement into the world.

"I will grant your request," Quinn said. "I think it would be good for you to see your family, but I believe there is a risk if we send you guys out at the moment. I'll contact Sach. Nearly most of your family members are with the Earthborn group, and I think it might be good to send one of the family leaders along with you as well.

"Maybe this could be the icebreaker that the world needs to see. As for your other request, I promise I will continue to look into it. As you know, things have been a little…"

"I understand your-"Before Ashley could finish what he was about to say, Quinn gave him a look, telling him not to say the next set of words from his mouth. "Yes, Quinn. Honestly, if you said no, we would understand, but for some of the soldiers, it has been a really hard time, and of course, we know the turning process is hard, or might not even be possible, after all, if it were you would have been turned back yourself by now, right?" Ashley smiled.

Hearing these words, Quinn's face remained the same, and he stared off into space for a few seconds.

"Quinn?" Ashley called after waiting a few minutes.

"Sorry, you may leave. I will talk to a few people; you can tell your group the good news." Quinn replied, but Ashley could still tell something was off, but he didn't pry further and left Quinn with his own thoughts.

'If I do find a way for vampires to turn back to a human…will I change myself back?' Quinn used to think about this a lot, but lately, he wasn't sure. Was living the life of a vampire wrong? When getting the vampire system initially, there were all sorts of downsides, but as Quinn grew stronger, he had gotten rid of most of the negative side-effects of being a vampire.

He no longer lusted too much for blood; with the ring, he could stay in the sunlight for as long as he wanted, and he was even more productive due to not needing as much sleep as a human. To give up all of this… was there any reason for him to?

——

A little while later, Quinn decided to call on two people working together more closely than they ever had done before - Vincent and Logan.

Since Logan had obtained all the knowledge of Richard Eno, he and Vincent operated closely on projects and shared information.

More teleporters had been set up in the vampire settlement, allowing travel between the Cursed ship and the vampire settlement, but for now, unless Sam allowed it, only a few were allowed to travel between. Logan still had to use the spray while here to make others think he was a vampire.

Although this was fine for a temporary solution, it wasn't like they could give all these to the Cursed faction members. A spray bottle and expect them to spray themselves every three hours without fail.

According to Fex, such a thing went horribly wrong for them before. Quinn had called the two of them because he had to ask them several things, and one of them was Paul's request.

Since Paul's death, Quinn had been thinking more about it lately. Wondering if he had completed the request before, sent the humans back, including Paul, perhaps the latter would have lived, or at least got to spend some time with his daughter, which was impossible to do now.

The three of them sat down. There were plenty of fancy chairs in Quinn's royal room and a lot of space as well. It was actually uncomfortable for Quinn. At the end of the day, he will still return to the tenth castle since that felt better, and truthfully he was missing his small room on the Cursed ship, where he would usually stay.

Still, Sam said it was a bad time for him to return at the moment, and Quinn knew that as well.

"I'm sorry, Quinn," Vincent said. "We tried to combine our knowledge, and we don't have a definite answer for you but only possibilities. Although I was able to do it for myself, that was due to my ability, and it came with a huge sacrifice."

"I understand," Quinn said. "Feel free to tell me these possibilities."

"Before we explain," Vincent said with a great look of concern on his face. "There is a good chance that if you wish to get rid of any of the vampires, that the solution might also get rid of them all. I don't mean in terms of killing them, but I believe there is a chance that all of the vampires would be turned back to being human."

*****

# Chapter 1408 - The Vampire God
Vincent's answer came as a big surprise to Quinn. In the first place, the Vampire Lord had a theory about how to turn a vampire back to a human, only he wasn't quite sure if he could do it himself.

One of the possible ways Quinn had theorised, was by using a combination of the second and third stage of Qi he had recently learned. He got the idea from the time when the infection had nearly spread to Chris, Quinn's Qi teacher, before he had found out that he was actually a high ranking member of Pure.

However, rather than becoming infected and transforming into a vampire, like what had happened to Leo, instead Chris had been able to isolate and then remove the infection from his body. Now that the Vampire Lord was more proficient in Qi usage, he realised that the Pure agent must have used a combination between the second stage and third stage to do this.

At the time, Chris had even expressed that perhaps there might be a way for him to completely remove this energy from Quinn.

However, without testing it out, it was uncertain whether this would work and if it did what consequences such an action might have. One of the major biological differences between humans and vampires was that the latter group eventually formed something known as a blood crystal.

This crystal was what created the red like aura energy around a vampire's body. Although removing the red energy could weaken them, Quinn suspected that as long as the blood crystal remained inside the body, the red energy would eventually return, similarly to how a body would replenish blood even if some of it got drained.

One of the possible risks that had prevented him from experimenting on this hypothesis was that removing all the energy inside a vampire, might potentially kill it. What if the crystal was something so vitally important to a vampire like their heart or brain? Or similar to beasts, even they couldn't live without their crystals.

Even if he had been willing to try it out, the third stage of Qi was something Quinn had only recently come to control, so he wasn't the best at it yet. The Vampire King would much rather have someone like Leo perform this, since his ability would help him in using the energy. Of course, asking his Vampire Knight to experiment on something like that, would just burden the Blind Swordsman's conscience if things were to go wrong.

Nevertheless, Quinn did intend to test it out eventually, though he would do so by either creating a vampire clone, or more preferably if they could capture one of the Masked. It would be a perfect opportunity for him to.

Still, due to the risks he was looking for another option, that could very well be the only option at the moment.

"I don't quite understand." Quinn honestly replied. "How would the solution turn all of the vampires back, wouldn't it be a case by case thing?"

Both Logan and Vincent looked at each other, it was clear the two of them had been talking a lot, but the real reason why they looked at each other was to figure out who was the best person to explain things to Quinn.

"Well we did a few tests, and with the knowledge that Richard left behind there are still elements that are beyond our control." Logan started to explain. "I'll try to put it in simpler terms. Contrary to what we thought, becoming a vampire has less to do with a human catching some type of 'disease' or 'infection'… it's actually more like some magic curse.

"Over the years, Richard had done a lot of experiments with vampires. I have them all on file, and it's what allowed me and Vincent to narrow down the likely possibilities. However, no matter what Richard had tried he had never been able to get completely rid of the cause of what was turning those into vampires.

"The only thing that seemed to have worked somewhat were abilities, one being Vincent's ability, and the other being the second family's ability. In the latter case, it only seemed to work within a certain timeframe. Not just that but the ability user had to be extremely powerful.

"If they were to use their ability to just rewind the cells in the body that had just changed, if they didn't rewind every aspect of the change in the body, then the body would just start to change back, filling up the foreign energy.

"Due to the properties of the red aura energy and looking into vampires' history, the most likely answer is magic."

"Or a power from a God." Vincent chimed in. "Logan told me how vampires originally came to be, and we met Bliss before, so we know that 'gods' actually exist, even if they seem to differ from common conception.

"However, there seems to be another plane, separate to the one we are currently on. Almost like another universe." Vincent started to explain and one could see the sparkle in his eyes. He was excited. "According to some, it is the place where souls go after their dead, and in this place there are many Gods that feed on these dead souls. While there are also other Gods, who seem to feed off the energy of living souls. One of them recorded down is the Goddess known as Bliss."

Hearing this made Quinn hate Bliss even more. It turned out that she wasn't exactly doing things just because she wanted to save human lives. If what Vincent said was true, people being born in a way were feeding her.

"I was trying to put together what Laxmus said that day. He was an Original, and he was also one of the ones originally turned when Richard opened the portal to this other Universe. I believe that the reason why Laxmus looked different and was stronger than others was because a God had granted him more powers expecting him to do his bidding by sending more of the dead souls to this other place.

"In the past, these types of Gods have given humans and creatures power hoping that they could send more sacrifices to their lands. Granting Richard and the others this infectious power, seems to have come from him, knowing he possibly was going to create this mess. Since this power originated from him, there is one assumption we can make.

"If you were to kill the God that started all of this, then his power would also fade in all of the vampires out there today. That appears to be the most promising solution we can offer you, although it's not guaranteed and we have no proof."

Quinn sat there for a while, whenever things started to get into God talk and souls it started to hurt his head a little. The world was already a strange place with space travel, beasts and vampires. To top it off his ancestor was apparently some dragon.

"Assuming you're right, how would we even go about it? I mean how do we even get to this other plane?" Quinn asked, not that he thought it would be something he would be doing anytime soon. They needed the vampire's powers, and the last thing he needed was everyone losing their powers.

Still, it was a worrying thought that perhaps, there was a God planning to use them in some way to kill everyone, just a small worry of the many Quinn already had.

"That's the problem, we currently have no idea. It seems like Richard had kept that information hidden. It's not available. I can only guess that he didn't want anyone committing the same mistake he did. After all, if we were to open another link, it might lead to the creation of more Originals, if not something even worse." Logan replied.

"Still, there seems to be one person out there that would know how to go about it. Someone that worked close to Richard, Bliss. Although finding her, might prove to be a problem on its own."

Quinn couldn't agree more, but then thinking about it, he thought that maybe there was another person who was far easier to find and more willing to help them. Someone who should have information about Bliss, the Gods and probably other things.

'How would I speak to him though…is there really a way?' Quinn started to think. 'Wait, what about the system. Vincent was in the system before, and Ray's consciousness from the tablet is still inside. Could there perhaps be a way for Shiro to move him from the tablet, over to my system? Maybe then I can freely speak to him. As long as the tablet stays intact, the world should still retain all abilities.'

"I want to 'test' something." Quinn said with a smile.

*****

# Chapter 1409 - Another Voice
It was a little strange for Quinn to no longer have Vincent in his head. He would often talk to the latter and ask him for guidance on things. With what Quinn had to go through, it was always good for him to get a second opinion from someone else, and he would hate to say it, but he kind of…missed it.

After explaining what he was planning to do, the others thought Quinn was a little crazy for wanting to go through that again. After all, his interactions with the ancient spirit inside the tablet had been minimal. Maybe Vincent was a calm and quiet person, but what about this Ray figure?

Either way, Quinn believed it was necessary to talk to him for a few reasons, for instance, the worry of Laxmus, his powers, and Bliss. Also, he had a promise to keep to Paul's men, and he would do well to keep it; it was the least he could do after Paul had sacrificed his life.

'Worst case, if things don't work out, or this person is annoying, I can get Shiro to just transfer him over to the tablet.'

Soon a call was made for Shiro to use the teleporter and head to the vampire settlement. The one who would be meeting him was Logan since the latter was the only one who could create the special potion to disguise others' smells.

After some time, Quinn decided to walk a little around the settlement. The main reason for this was, he wanted to see how the vampires were dealing with things. He had a recognizable face, so Quinn wore a mask that would cover the bottom half of his face while he walked around.

At the moment, it was nighttime on the Daisy planet, and the vampires mainly were outside. He had noticed a change in the vampire's regular actions. Before, it felt like a city that would be alive and vibrant twenty-four hours of the day, but now they are living more like humans. Staying in during the day and coming out at night, despite the rings that had been given to them.

'I guess this planet is sunnier than the others. It has a good environment for the plants to grow.' Quinn mused. 'At least it wasn't the desert planet, where the sunlight can go on for several days. This planet has a similar day-cycle to earth.'

While strolling around, Quinn found out that most of the vampires were fine with their situation. They didn't have many complaints, but it was perhaps due to them not having to do anything yet. The vampires had made themselves comfortable here because, to them, this settlement was their home.

Neither had they been told to fight nor were they disturbed by the Humans.

'While trying to help the humans… I'll be disrupting the vampires' lifestyle…' Quinn thought while looking at everyone.

Still, what else could he do? They had to stop the Dalki now.

Suddenly, a thought dawned upon him.

'The Dalki should know the weakness of the vampires. If they time their attack, they could attack during the day. If that were to happen, most of the vampire rings would only last two to four hours. If they know about the rings, they could even target the vampire rings. I'll have to think of something fast if they are going to move that quickly.'

While walking around, Quinn was looking for something else, perhaps a spot where he could place the giant tablet. Behind the Royale castle, Quinn thought of adjusting it slightly, so there was a large space like a type of garden.

The tablet was far too big to be hidden away or stored in a room; in fact, it was almost the size of the castle.

'I can't keep it in my shadow forever. There is a chance that I could even die, especially if I'm going to be fighting more often. If that were to happen, won't all the items in my dimensional space just appear? If they destroy the tablet, then its abilities would also stop working, right that's what Ray said.'

Thinking about this, Quinn chuckled to himself a bit. In a way, he had Pure's answers to solve their problem with him, and he also had the Dragon, which the Dalki wanted. Then he also had the Absolute Blood Control the vampires wouldn't want to give up.

Three things that three different groups wanted were all in his possession. After thinking about it a lot and having no better place to put the tablet, Quinn opened up his System and slightly altered the settlement.

The settlement would rumble whenever he did this, and the vampires would know their King was up to something. However, as it quickly died down, so did their excitement. For them, they hadn't seen anything new being built.

Quickly moving to the large one, the space was a bit plain. The ground was filled with dark soil, and there was no grass like the rest of the planet.

'I think this would also be a good place for Helen. I'll be sure to fill it with a field of flowers for her.'

Before Quinn was to place the tablet down, he hesitated for a second.

'Can I trust the vampires? If they were to find out what this was. After I have left this place, what happens if this was destroyed.'

Quinn had to think about what was more likely to happen in the end. Would he fall to the Dalki or some external force, or would the settlement fall and change hands.

'Perhaps I could make up something to stop the vampires from attacking this.' Quinn smiled and placed his hand on the ground.

Shadow rose from above, and out in the sky, a large tablet appeared. All the vampires turned around pointing, as they looked at what was taking place. For a second, some of them were afraid. They hadn't had the best experience when seeing shadows in the past.

When they saw what it was though, their hearts settled, and soon, they could see the whole tablet in the sky and Quinn also next to it.

"I need to make sure this is deep in the ground!" Quinn claimed as he fell through his own shadow portal, and with both his hands and his incredible strength, he pushed himself forward, trying his best to push the giant stone tablet into the ground.

One foot, two feet… several feet later, Quinn felt satisfied now that the whole tablet was left sturdy in place, and just in time, it looked like Shiro, Vincent, and Logan had arrived.

——

All of them stood in front of the tablet. All of those who somewhat knew about the System. Some people knew a lot about Quinn, but hardly any of those knew about the System he had with him.

"I'm not sure this will work this time," Shiro said, a little shaky. "But I'll give it my best."

"Of course, the only thing we can do is try." Quinn smiled back.

A few minutes before others had arrived, Quinn tried to communicate with the tablet as he had done in the past, but there was no luck. Which meant this was most likely the only way.

'Who knows, maybe I can finally complete that other quest as well.' Quinn thought as he closed his eyes and held onto Shiro's hand. Something he had done a few times already.

Shiro, then walked slowly up to the tablet, step by step, and finally placed his hand on it. Both Logan and Vincent stood by the sides, even they were nervous about what would happen.

Although Shiro didn't want to say it, he believed that as long as he could find the consciousness in the tablet, there was a good chance he could move it into the System. Inside Quinn's head, there were almost two spaces, and that was where he had found Vincent before.

A few seconds later, the tablet started to light up. Since it was the middle of the night, it was impossible for the other leaders and the vampires not to notice the scene. It looked magical, but some of the leaders worried, what on earth was Quinn doing now?

The tablet's light started to fade, and Shiro had a big smile on his face.

"Did it work?" Quinn wondered.

'What the f*ck is going on?!' A loud voice rang through his head. 'Where the hell am I? What did you do, you idiot?!'

It looked like the job was done, but now, Quinn had a few things to explain.

*****

# Chapter 1410 - System Helper
The transfer had been a success, and once again, Quinn had a voice in his head, only this time it was vastly different from the one before. For one, while Vincent had remained mostly silent, Ray seemed to be quite talkative.

'Can't you be calm for a second?!' Quinn muttered, holding his head and covering his ears, even though he knew this wouldn't be any help in this situation.

The other two by the side watched Quinn's strange actions and smiled because they realized that it had been a success. In fact, one could even see Vincent chuckling a bit.

'Well, I remember there were times when you thought I was annoying, but it seems like you have your own problems now.' Vincent thought. 'You never realize what you have until it's missing.'

Quinn was still wiggling his head about, and he was finding it hard to focus. He was even somewhat regretting his earlier decision. If something like this were to occur during a fight, it would be troublesome.

"Just quit it. Otherwise, I'll put you back in the Tablet!" Quinn almost shouted.

At that moment, three leaders had seemingly appeared out of nowhere - Muka, Jin, and Sunny. They had great concern about what was going on at the Royal Castle and were afraid that an attack had transpired.

"Your majesty, do you need help?" Muka asked. "Has something infected your mind? Is it Laxmus?"

"Perhaps, he left something that infected our King?" Jin guessed.

"If that's the case, we have to save him!" Sunny shouted.

The three looked like they were about to act, but Vincent stepped in front of the three with his hands spread out before they could.

"I assure you the King is fine; please, there is nothing to worry about. If he needs you, Quinn would definitely summon you."

The others looked at Quinn, who was currently rubbing his head. They weren't so convinced, and in the first place, they didn't exactly trust Vincent as much as Quinn did. This person was a leader who had suddenly turned on the whole settlement and appeared to be loyal at the time.

They figured that if something came up, that perhaps he might do the same again.

Noticing their presence, Quinn gave them the thumbs up, indicating them not to worry about the situation.

Although this didn't settle their worries, they were reassured that Quinn had the power to summon them whenever needed, and eventually, they decided to leave.

——

Heading back into the castle, away from the eyes of the others, Quinn had eventually told Ray everything that had occurred, and most importantly, why they had decided to bring Ray into the System in the first place.

The annoying thing was that Quinn had to relay everything Ray was saying to the others, since they could not hear the latter through the System.

"Ugh, pathetic, you don't even know how to use telepathy; what kind of ancestor are you?" Ray asked.

"Look, times have changed; I don't know if it's because of the Tablet or what was set up, but we are only able to carry one ability. I know you said in your time, you had multiple abilities, but that's just not possible in today's day and age!" Quinn responded in annoyance.

Talking to someone who hadn't been alive for perhaps a thousand years was tiring, and of course, Ray would have non-stop questions about everything. Eventually, Ray caught up on everything that had happened so far and the world.

Logan had even explained how Richard was, in fact, Lenny. Which Ray found a bit strange because he actually knew Lenny during his time, but when he saw him on the Blade island, the latter didn't look the same.

According to their information, as Lenny evolved as a vampire, his appearance continued to change, which was why Ray could not recognize him.

"It was a risky thing you did. Who knows if removing me from the Tablet would have disrupted the abilities you currently have. Although it seems like my powers have been left in the Tablet. I can tell even though I am here in this…of all things a system."

Ray was finding the situation a difficult one, especially for him.

"So you are curious about these gods and the other side, huh? Well, I will be honest with you, such things never fascinated me, and they were quite fearful of someone like me during my time.

"The gods that I have encountered varied in strength with what they could do and couldn't do. If they take a human form or reside in a human, it is almost impossible to tell who is one or not. However, your plan does have a chance of succeeding.

"If that doesn't work, then I would say, another way is that you could even possibly force the God to remove his power from them. If he was able to give this Laxmus power as you claim, then surely he could take it away, without the need to kill him; however, I warn you of one thing.

"Bliss told me once that gods can never die. Perhaps killing him will make him lose his power temporarily, and they go into a cycle of reincarnation. The time until they are born could vary, but eventually, they will come back again. And how do you think that God would feel once he returned."

As Ray said everything, Quinn relayed it to the others, while Vincent and Logan seemed to be jotting it down in their heads.

"We have learned a little bit more about the gods, but we still have one problem, how do we go to the other side?" Logan asked.

"The answer to that would be Bliss," Ray replied. "However, after what you told me about Laxmus and the crystal…I would avoid her… I don't know what her real agenda is, neither am I sure if she is on your side or not."

'What do you mean?' Quinn asked. Of course, she might have been annoying, but surely she was on their side and wanted to save the humans.

'Because I was the one that gave that Shadow Crystal to her.' Ray replied. 'That shadow crystal was from my time. Before I decided to pass on, I had given that Crystal to her. I knew it held great power, and I thought there was something that she could do with it.

'Now tell me, how did Laxmus end up getting that power in the first place? I can only guess that it was due to her, and then the crystal returned and was in the hands of your old vampire king? She is the only person alive that would know what power that crystal held. So it could be only her, which raises the question: why had she done such a thing?'

Thinking about what Ray had said, with Bliss having the power to see the future. Did she know that it would return in Laxmus's hands? If that was the case, then maybe she was also trying to help the other gods.

Now Quinn didn't know who to trust.

'Just trust yourself.' Ray said. 'That is how I lived, and I believe that is how you should live as well.'

"So, what do you plan to do?" Vincent asked. "Do you plan to put Ray back into the Tablet? It doesn't seem to have disturbed your System."

'I think I'll leave this on you. You already did your part, so do you wish to rest back in the Tablet?' Quinn asked.

It didn't take long for Ray to respond.

'No, take me with you. I did so much to save this place, and it is in danger once again. I wish to see the outcome of it all. Besides, I think there might be a way I can help you.'

They had made the decision, and once again, Quinn had one more helper that would be in his System, but he was wondering just what Ray could provide him that Vincent could not?

——

Time slowly passed by, and Quinn had gotten the 'okay' from Sach to send over the vampire soldiers to see their family members. He also made the suggestion for it to be filmed. This way, the public could slowly get used to this, as they will slowly introduce more vampires into the world ecosystem, but it did come with a warning.

The board had called for a meeting with Sach, and they wanted to discuss something with him promptly. He didn't know the details but would update Quinn as soon as possible.

'It looks like the Dalki are still waiting for something. I imagined they might have acted by now. Well, if they won't act, then we will just have to act ourselves sooner.' Quinn thought as he looked at the number of subclasses they had at their disposal.

Perhaps, one of the leaders could be sent with these, rather than the vampires, to take over one of the Dalki planets. The only problem was that upon poking the sleeping beasts, it might cause a great reaction.

…

The training between the vampires continued, and Quinn had to plan his next move when a small ship could be seen returning to the vampire settlement. It landed at the Royal Castle since it had permission.

It had decided to land in the garden, especially since this was one of Quinn's most treasured guests. As the ramp settled on the ground, the person came out, and upon exiting, his wings started to flap.

"I thought I would never come back to this place; well, I guess technically it's a new place." Alex smiled. They had finally developed the blood gauntlet, and Alex was here to deliver it to Quinn personally.

*****

# Chapter 1411 - Special Blood
A while ago Vincent had made the suggestion that Quinn should make a Blood gauntlet. For one, Blood weapons were in some cases just as strong or even stronger than beast weapons depending on the grade of crystal they were created with. Although they did have one downside, for them to use their full potential they needed to be activated with blood. However, as long as it was fresh it worked with all kinds of blood and Dalki blood in particular also gave them an extra boost.

Since Quinn would be fighting against the Dalki, it seemed to be the perfect type of weapon that could be used as a replacement for his old gauntlet that he had to give up due to his system's penalty. His left hand had felt quite bare for a while now.

At the same time, this wouldn't be a weapon created from just an ordinary Blood crystal, but from none other than Jim Eno, the creator of Dalki.

'I don't know why, but the thought of having a weapon made from Jim Eno, the person who caused all this mess and killing those Dalki with them, pleases me in some way.' Quinn thought, as he headed outside to meet up with the two.

'That sounds quite dark, but I like it.' Ray commented. 'Ga, ga, ga, ga.'

After having just got Vincent out of his head, Quinn had to remind himself to suppress his thoughts a bit more, otherwise a certain someone would be able to hear him. Even then there was one thing that he couldn't get used to, and that was Ray's laugh.

'Who laughs like that, ga, ga, ga?' Quinn wondered, yet he got no answer this time.

Regardless, he had come outside to meet someone and the Vampire King could see that Alex had already arrived, though it was via ship rather than over the teleporter. Not only that but the people that had come with him seemed to be soldiers, who were too afraid to leave the ship.

"Don't mind them." Alex said as he greeted Quinn. "They're just afraid of this place, but I can't really blame them since they're from the Earthborn group. Anyway, look at you, I saw the broadcast about you becoming King and everything! Do I need to start calling you Your Majesty as well now?" Alex started to pat his back a few times, and then wondered if that was really okay, or if he had committed some type of grave offence.

He had to remember that his very existence was taboo to the vampires, but he was sure that Quinn wouldn't enforce that rule.

'Right?' Alex gulped for a second.

Although the two weren't perhaps as close as others with Quinn, Alex still saw the Cursed faction leader as someone who had changed his life in more ways than one, and when the two of them spoke they had no filter with each other.

Alex had only been away for a while because he had been helping out Andrew, who had been tasked with helping the Earthborn group create some weapons, but he was finally back in his rightful place, by Quinn's side making him the best weapons possible.

"Yeah…I guess a lot did happen." Quinn replied, as he looked behind him and onto the ship. The vampire could feel it almost instantly and it was the first time he could ever sense a blood weapon before he had touched it.

"I see you're just as excited as I am, well I have a nice surprise for you." Alex's wings quickly flapped about, lifting him into the air. He whizzed straight back to the ship, and had brought back what was clearly a gauntlet placed underneath a cloth.

This time there was only one weapon, adn Quinn wondered why there was any need to bother with the cloth trick he usually would do, because he already knew what it was.

While watching Alez return with ease, stopping quickly and landing, Quinn could see that It was clear that not once had Alex stopped practice with his wings, making him a lot better at flying. The Blood fairy seemed to be faster and more agile than any of the winged transformations Quinn had ever seen before. Watching him like this, Quinn mused that if Alex ever decided to become a fighter instead of a forger, he probably would be able to launch devastating aerial attacks.

However, that would be truly a waste of his talents.

Once again, Alex carefully lifted the cloth pulling it quickly off in one smooth motion revealing the single gauntlet underneath. It wasn't a pair like it would be before, which made Quinn believe that perhaps it could even be stronger.

"This is probably one of the best looking gauntlets I have ever created. It took some time, but that was mainly because the Blood crystal you gave me was far denser compared to the others. There was so much energy overflowing and I wanted to use it properly." Alex explained while Quinn stared at all its details.

Usually, the blood weapons tended to be red in colour, or if Alex added his fairy blood to the mix it would be red as well. Something Quinn had requested to be done with every single weapon Alex made.

Strangely, this weapon was mainly black in colour instead. The hand placement was so fine and looked light and thin. If Quinn were to wear it, it would be hard to tell that it was a weapon and not a glove.

Then the rest of the gauntlet design was interesting to say the least. From the wrist, there were two overlapping spiralling parts. It looked like two snakes or dragons intertwining as it moved up the forearm part, and then towards the elbow it would split off, bending inward looking like two giant ram horns.

Where the gauntlets split slightly on the forearm, there was a strange red glow to it, and even now a strange red mist could be seen coming from it.

"The red mist appeared after I dropped a few drops of human blood on it." Alex explained seeing Quinn trying to run his fingers through it, but it did nothing. "I was trying to test out what it could do of course.

"I know some of the Blood weapons had active skills, similar to that of the beast weapons, this one is a little strange but I think you will be able to put it to good use. When touching a human, and I guess a Dalki, it can actually drain the blood from them.

"There is no need to pour blood from the weapon itself or stab someone with it, and I also noticed that it feels like you can take the energy that is drained by adding it to yourself. Your skills, use your Blood energy, I guess you could see this gauntlet as a reserve of some type.

"You could carry on using your Blood skills without having to stress yourself!" Alex continued to explain happily, only to realise that Quinn's face showed a disappointed look.

This was because the active, or passive skill on the gauntlet didn't sound so great when he had a Blood armour set that acted as an unlimited supply of blood to use whenever he wished.

If all it could do was store blood, then it was no better than his Blood bank, which was also not needed when he had the Blood armour on him…

However, Quinn tried to put on a smile, he knew Alex had worked hard on this. How could the forger have ever predicted that someone had created something to that effect and his leader had come into its possession.

"Thank you, Alex," Quinn said, deciding to try on the gauntlet anyway. After all, at least it looked cool and would surely give him additional stats when powered, and when not.

'That is quite cool looking.' Ray said. 'Still, when I was around I had my own Dragon armour that was far more impressive than that. I wonder if it's still around, or what has happened to it? Where did I even put it?'

'Dragon armour?' Quinn questioned. It was a weird name, the only beast he had seen that looked like a dragon was the Demon tier beast, and wondered why it would be called that.

'Yes, it was the armour I used. I can guarantee that if you were to find it, you would have no problem dealing with any of them. Even a Demon tier beast could be slayed with a single swing of my Dragon Sword.'

It was then that Quinn couldn't help but laugh. Despite his current strength, he would never even dream of killing a Demon tier beast that easily. To him it just seemed that his ancestor was a big liar who was trying to impress his descendant. Even if he wasn't lying, he seemed to exaggerate a whole lot.

Regardless, Quinn placed the gauntlet on himself not expecting much, and used his Inspect skill.

'…how is this possible? This isn't what Alex said AT ALL!!! …can this gauntlet really do this… Well, I can't blame him for not realising it. Alex, you seem to have crafted something even greater then the Demon tier Amulet!!!'

[Active skill]

[Equivalent upgrade]

[…]

*****

# Chapter 1412 - The Blood Gauntlet
When using his Inspect skill, a clear picture of what the Blood gauntlet could actually do was revealed. It made Quinn wonder why Alex hadn't discovered its effects from his little test, but that's when Quinn could see in detail the exact reason why, and it was all in the description of the active skill itself.

[Passive skill]

[Blood drain: Whenever the gauntlet comes into contact with blood that is accepted by the gauntlet. It will begin to drain the opponent's blood, storing it in the gauntlet. The user may use the stored blood as he wishes.]

[3/10,000]

The first part was exactly as Alex had described. A nice thing to have, depending on the amount of blood that could be stored, it would allow Quinn to use Blood skills with no worry. The number underneath seemed to be the stored blood amount, but Quinn wasn't sure how much blood was equal to points to fit up the gauntlet.

Still, with the King's Blood armour, it seemed like a useless skill, that was until he read the second part of the gauntlet's abilities.

[Active skill]

[Equivalent upgrade]

[This skill can only be activated once the gauntlet's blood storage has been filled to its maximum.In exchange for the giantlets blood, the user is able to upgrade one piece of equipment up to the next tier. This is able to work on armour, blood weapons and beast weapons.]

[Attention: After every usage, the required blood amount will increase.]

Out of all the things Quinn had gotten before this seems to be one of the best items. In the past he had received an upgrade crystal, which had allowed him to upgrade an item up one rank. However there had still been a limit, so the best he had been able to do was to increase an Emperor tier item into a Demi-god tier one.

On the other hand, the Inspect skill didn't state that the Blood gauntlet had any such limits at all.

'This…I could upgrade my other gauntlet to the Demon tier! The unbreakable sword, and even blood weapons! There would be no need to hunt for Demon tier beasts.' Quinn thought excitedly.

However, before he got too excited, he started to wonder what possible downsides this might have. The first thing that came to mind was that an upgraded weapon might not be as powerful as an officially Demon tier made weapon. His reason for thinking this was due to the unique active skills that Demon tier weapons seemed to possess.

They tended to mimic the beasts they came from, and weaker beasts didn't usually have strong or special abilities, so perhaps the Equivalent upgrade would 'just' manifest itself in the form of a boost to the overall stats or power. Of course, every little bit counted, and he already knew what armour set would make for a perfect testing target.

'But why three? What could the three out of ten thousand mean?' Quinn wondered.

"Alex, say how much blood did you try to put into the gauntlet? And how much did you drain when you tried to use it?" Quinn asked the forger.

"I actually performed a few different tests." Alex happily answered. "So first I just used blood we had in storage on the weapon. If placed on the surface of the gauntlet it will absorb it but even after I emptied the whole bag it didn't seem to have done anything special, so I could only assume it was stored in the gauntlet.

"It's actually quite shocking seeing that the other blood weapons that I forged activated with far less. Well, I thought it might be a bit more special seeing as it was clearly a tier above the rest. As such, I asked around for a couple of 'volunteers'.

"After touching them with the gauntlet, they both reported a tingling feeling that was making them quite uncomfortable. I became a little worried what would happen if I continued, so I stopped after testing it on the two. Unfortunately, I never found out another effect after that."

Listening to Alex, Quinn thought he had figured out what it was, it was similar to how he gained stats.

"To summarise, you used the blood of three different types of people, correct?" Quinn wanted to make sure and the Blood fairy nodded in confirmation.

Although blood could be stored in the gauntlet and used as a power source, the number to use the active skill was different. Which meant to use the active skill of the blood gauntlet he would have to gather the blood of 10,000 different people, and this would increase each time he used the active skill.

'Well, there goes my idea of using the King's Blood amour to make up all of the blood to use the Equivalent upgrade skill. I guess it would have been asking for too much if things would really be that easy. Should I just ask for another blood donation?

'There are more than ten thousand people in the Cursed faction. There should be over a hundred thousand on all of the planets, and we should probably have more than ten thousand in storage. If I want to upgrade something first it will be the gauntlet.'

"Alex, you have created something truly amazing, thank you. I don't even think you know what you have created." Quinn praised him with a smile.

Of course, this made the Blood fairy curious and so the Vampire Lord explained what he had learned about the Blood gauntlet. After much discussion even Alex couldn't believe it. This item bypassed all the rules of a forger! It would just upgrade the weapon there and then, it was similar to an ability than anything else. Speaking, Alex had a condition for helping him create such a weapon, when he used the skill, he would love to watch how it would work.

The only thing the two could think of, was who the crystal had come from. Due to it coming from Jim, it must have had some type of influence on the Blood weapon.

"It looks like I'll need to contact Sam and get some work done, what about the other things I asked for?" Quinn asked.

"Ah, those, well that's why I came here, I thought maybe I could talk to some of the leaders to get something more personal for them. Honestly, that Blood gauntlet took a long time. Knowing how great it actually is, makes all those hours I spent on it truly worth it though!"

Quinn thought it wasn't such a bad idea, and decided that it should be fine for Alex to meet with the leaders, as long as one of the Royal knights were there. They already knew he did things differently, and they wouldn't dare harm Alex just because he was a Blood fairy.

Just as Quinn was about to make a call though, he could tell that his own mask was vibrating. It was a bit strange that he still used a mask to talk to others rather than a standard receiver or ear piece, but he was just used to it by now, and placed it on his face.

"Sach I wasn't expecting you to call me so soon." Quinn greeted the other.

"Neither did I." Sach replied, in a quite serious tone. Thinking back to what he had said not too long ago, Quinn would guess that this possibly had something to do with the Board.

"It's about the Board, they want me to invite you to something…" Sach nervously said.

——

At the same time, on one of the Graylash planets they had received a request for a ship from the Earthborn group to land. Naturally, Owen had granted it permission. It was only one ship, and they needed to work together. He was also curious to find out what could be so urgent at a time like this that it had to be discussed in person, when all groups were busy dealing with the Dalki.

When the ship landed, one of the old Head Generals, and now only a general could be seen coming off from the ship. It was quite the high ranking personal in the Earthborn group which came as a supers, and even the five around him were colonels who had their own squads.

Being escorted, they eventually reached down, and the general gave a polite sublet, before handing him an official letter with a seal.

"All this way, to personally deliver a letter? Are we still living in the past? I feel like this could have just been a call." Owen stated with an awkward smile.

"This is for your eyes only, sir." The general replied. "We couldn't risk such a thing getting out there, especially in case the Dalki might be able to listen in on us."

Owen accepted the letter, and could see a seal on the top. A seal he hadn't seen in a long time. Grim, who was by his side, also remembered it well, because it was a seal that he had seen when the Graylash family had been asked to become one of the Big Four, and be a part of the leaders table.

"So they have chosen to get involved, they are ridiculous." Grim complained out loud, looking at the General who seemed to be quite nervous. Grim turned his head as if he didn't care about the matter while his grandson opened it to read its contents.

"Oh…An invitation, and I can already guess who else got one of these. Well this certainly is interesting, very interesting indeed." Owen smiled.

*****

# Chapter 1413 - A Debut
The Earthborn members were busy, particularly the generals, but they weren't busy fighting against the Dalki or preparing their next move. Like others such as Sach and Samantha were; instead, they were busy dealing with the special letters.

Each of these letters had a seal on them. Particular members of the Earthborn group that occupied the voting seats knew what the seal was. However, some who received this letter, in particular, knew nothing about it all. The seal which belonged to the Board.

But this didn't lead them to misunderstand the seriousness of the matter because high-ranking generals and colonels were the ones delivering the invitation. They thought someone as high-up as the Supreme commander had to be behind these letters.

Many had received invitations, all hand-delivered letters. No matter where they were, the letters reached them without any hiccups. As for those that were invited, there seemed to be a general pattern behind it.

First were the powerful members of the Earthborn Group, Sach, Samantha, and a few of the generals who were handing out the letters themselves. Then some of the letters were handed to Travellers on Earth. Names that didn't stand out in the world. They were known as the Unranked.

These were a group of people that didn't join any guild and decided to become solo Travellers. It was because of this that their reputation didn't reach great heights like the factions. Of course, they would never dare to start a fight with a faction that had so much backing and many powerful people, but there were rumours that some of these Unranked travellers could be just as strong as the big four.

——

At the same time, Mona was on one of the Earthborn planets. It wasn't the one that Sach and Samantha were based at. She was on a planet named Lynan that had a rocky surface, making it hard to smooth out certain areas. Still, it also was ideal for setting up traps for the Dalki, which was why the Earthborn group had decided to keep this planet compared to the others.

The sky was a mix of violet and orange, while at night, it would shine a beautiful indigo color. The days were short here, half the length of that on earth, and the surface was cold. The shelter situated here was different from the others.

While a shelter would normally be one base where multiple people lived, this one instead was split into five parts. Constantly ships would be used to travel to each section, or in case of emergencies, tunnels were linking all the bases with each other.

This had to be done due to the strange terrain of rocks.

After leaving the vampire solar system, Mona had returned to the Cursed faction but soon had proceeded to the Earth faction instead. She had planned to try and regroup as much of the Bree family as possible.

She was slowly regaining her group's power, especially now that she had a little gift from Quinn. She was slightly afraid though, because if she were to do such a thing under Sach's nose, even if it weren't him, perhaps others around would report this, and an investigation would be carried forward.

They would attempt to shut her down before she could become as big as she once was.

As for why she had decided to go to planet Lynan, it was due to Nathan staying here. Nathan originally was part of the military, but when the group restructured itself under Oscar's command, he was given command of a part of the military to help the Cursed faction. Another part of the military was also handed to the Graylash faction as a sign of good faith.

It always left Nathan in a tricky situation since he didn't know where his true loyalty lay, whether in the Earthborn group or the Cursed faction, but it looked like both of them treated him like he was a part of them.

Just then, Nathan was heading to a large building that acted as a tavern. There was a [Closed] sign outside hanging. This place was at one of the separate five pieces of the shelter, and was also where Mona and the rest of her members she had gathered were staying. And upon her personal request, Nathan hadn't reported anything to the Earthborn group about what Mona was doing here.

Standing outside, one could hear the noise of laughter coming from inside of the tavern. Nathan looked around to see if anyone was spying or had followed him, and a few moments later, he pushed the tavern's door open. As soon as he entered, Nathan heard a big crash, and he could see a piece of wood get chucked up, skimming right past his face.

The sound of cheering continued, and regaining his composure, Nathan witnessed a sight that he had seen a few times but just couldn't get used to it.

"Come on, show him what you got, Rogarth!" A man shouted.

A monkey-like beast with a tail of a snake was in battle, being controlled by one of the members of the Bree family. He stood by his beast's side and had armour on himself that seemed to have seen better days.

The monkey quickly went in for the attack, leaping up in the air, and at the same time, it shot out green venom from its tail towards its opponent. Just then, the man also appeared by their opponent's side and was ready to attack its legs with a hammer.

It lifted its leg at the right time and slammed its foot down on the hammer while dodging the venom to grab the monkey by the neck. As for what the opponent was, it was none other than a Dalki.

"Mona!" Nathan called out, walking forward and still nervous about the Dalki in the place. This was the scene he couldn't get used to, a Dalki that was under control using a Demon-tier weapon. It was also why they had to be so secretive.

Mona didn't have a shadow where she could hide the Dalki anytime she wished, and if others were to see it, then she and her people would be in serious trouble. It would just frighten the public; before she gets the chance to explain, they might even assume that she was a V.

Since now the public knew some could also resist blood, there was no sure way to test who was a V and who was not.

"Sorry, I was just getting some training in," Mona said.

"I see…" Nathan glanced at the Dalki by her side.

Mona wanted to practice with the Bree members, making them stronger when facing the Dalki, and what better way than to make them actually go up against them. At the same time, she was practising her own control when using the Dalki as well.

It was then, Nathan pulled out an invitation and handed it to her.

"I'm sure you know who this is from," Nathan said.

Looking at the seal, she knew straight away who it had come from. Then opening up the letter and reading it, she couldn't help but laugh out loud.

"Do you know what's in this letter?" She asked.

Nathan nodded, and he knew that this perhaps would be her reaction.

"What are they thinking? Is this a threat they are trying to pull? Are they trying to doom the entire human race by doing this at a time like this? I can't understand what they are thinking…Well, at least it looks there might be a chance that you get to make a debut to the whole world.

"What do you think? Do you think the world would be happy to see your comeback, or perhaps they would be surprised about your return?"

Nathan hadn't noticed, but there was a figure sitting in the back at the far end of the tavern. He had a helmet on, and while Nathan was handing over the letter, the figure stood up. His body was quite large, and he carried with him what looked like a box, held to his side.

That's when Nathan noticed him, and when looking inside the figure's helmet, he found out there was no head but a blue floating spirit.

'Is this a beast, but it looks human; who is this?' Nathan couldn't help but wonder.

# Chapter 1414 - The Contents Of The Letter
The Cursed faction was in an awkward situation currently, more uncomfortable than they ever had been. The Cursed ship was no longer floating in space and instead had descended on a clay-like planet named Scimal.

This was the planet that the members of the Daisy faction had taken refuge on, when the Dalki had taken over. It was located at the back behind the Shelter, and most of the crew was no longer on board. Land just always seemed to feel better to humans despite how long they had been in space. Which was why most of the Cursed faction were in the Shelter but ready to be called at any point and time.

On the Cursed ship itself, though, there was something big going on. Quinn had returned, and it was a joyous event now that their leader was returning to the Cursed ship after a long time. Or at least it should have been a joyous event.

Many people wanted to talk to Quinn, ask what had happened to him, and see how he was doing. The problem was that he wasn't returning alone. In the command centre, where the Cursed leaders would regularly hold meetings, it had been cleared.

There was no reason for personnel to be there in the first place since the ship wasn't operating, not that it needed operators in the first place since all of it was automatic. Still, the main reason why it was empty was that a grand meeting was to take place. Possibly the biggest gathering the Cursed faction had ever held.

There would be no cameras in the room today, but it was an event that would have easily shocked the entire world.

The room was silent; on one side, there were all of the Cursed leaders and some of Quinn's closest friends. Nate, Dennis, Layla, Leo, Megan, Sil, Peter, Logan, Borden, Raten, Vorden, Linda, and Sam. Other than them, the two sisters Ivy and Peach, were invited as well. Since their sister's death, they had taken over her role, and those in the Shelter listened to them far better than members of the Cursed faction.

On the other side, there were the vampire leaders, new and old. The only one that wasn't present was Fex, who was still at the vampire settlement, placed in charge of the knights while the others were away.

It was extremely awkward, to say the least, as the two sides just looked at each other. The Cursed faction leaders were strange, to begin with; they had mixtures of different level tier beasts, along with a human that had a Dalki arm, a Dalki itself, and a bunch of vampires and subclasses.

It was a strange sight for the leaders to see, and they were wondering just how this strange group had come to be.

"It feels wrong to have vampires on the other side," Nicu whispered with his arms crossed.

"What is that meant to mean?" Nate frowned, taking it as a type of insult. "You do know that most of us on this ship have been humans longer than vampires. It's not like we are betraying you."

"He's right, Nicu," Sunny interrupted. "And in the first place, it's not the other side, remember our king wishes us to bring the two sides together."

"Temporarily bring the two sides together." The second leader, Katori Cha, commented.

"And what does that exactly mean?" Vorden asked, "That once the Dalki are done with that, you will see us as enemies as well?"

"No," Jake added, supporting his fellow leader. "But how could you expect us higher beings to mix in with you lot? Even now, you need our help."

"You think?" Sil smirked, "I'm pretty sure there are some humans that you have never met before that are even stronger than you. We are both helping each other, and I'm happy to test this out."

Raten gave his brother a hit on the arm. It looked like the time they had been spending together had improved his talking.

"And beasts, which we would be happy to test!" Raten backed up his brother, already forming his hand into a blade.

Hearing all of this, Sam just couldn't stop shaking his head, but what else did he expect a meeting between the two sides to go like? This was exactly why the introduction of two sides needed to go slowly. He could only imagine if the vampires were introduced during the old rule.

"Enough!" Quinn shouted, stopping the argument and stopping the two sides from what looked like a clash about to happen. "Look, we all have our reasons, and I plan to still be around when the Dalki are defeated.

"So you guys, don't think I won't be king once this whole thing is over, and just like with any culture, we should learn to respect and understand the other cultures. Besides, the vampires have a right to be cautious of us, because in a way they're right…" Quinn chucked an envelope out onto the table.

The seal on it had already been broken, so it was clear Quinn had read its contents.

"This is the whole reason why I've called both of you. In a way, I kind of wanted to emulate what they wanted to do."

The whole group stared at the letter; they had no idea about its importance but could tell from Quinn's words that he had given some hint at the same time.

"They also notified me about this; I knew you would get one," Logan said as he started to type away and brought up the letter on display for everyone to read.

It took a while for everyone to take in Logan's information. It was about what the board members were exactly planning and how he had been invited. They were simply at a loss for words.

Next, Quinn displayed his letter to the others, and they could see that it was slightly different.

"From what we can gather, the invitation Logan received was sent out to several people. It looks like they have invited many strong people to this event, and they have also requested something big of Logan." Sam explained.

"Then from Quinn's letter, as you can see, they wish for him to bring along all of the leaders who have had a public appearance on camera." Sam continued.

"What is wrong with humans?" Jake replied. "We decided to come along, we extend our hand to help them in this war, and then they want us to gather and fight with them. What is the point of this?"

"It won't be an official fight," Logan says. "I believe they want to test your strength against the strongest humans. The battle will take place using VR machines. I can record all of your data so it will be 99 percent equal to as if you were fighting in real life." Logan explained.

"I understand," Lee said. "But how is a fight meant to bring the humans and the vampires closer together? If we defeat them-"

"Which we will." Nicu interrupted.

"If we completely defeat them, then won't they be more afraid of us?" Lee finished his sentence.

The others agreed with this, and so did those on the Cursed ship.

"I didn't want to say anything, but there are quite a few invitations that got sent out to those on the Cursed ship. Leo and Sil as well. They don't want this to be taking sides, but they want it to appear that everyone is just showing their power. But why at a time like this, I don't know. The Dalki could attack at any second."

"The worst thing is, they're blackmailing us." Quinn finally said. "I read the letters that they sent to me and the others, and it's clear. These people, these members of the board, have said that if a person or group chooses to refuse this invitation, they will no longer support them.

"According to Logan, each one of these ten families holds great power. We currently get food pills for the Cursed faction from them. One of the families has 90 percent of the Galthrium supply that we use to build and repair our ships. Even Alex needs Glathrium to make our top tier beast weapons.

"I thought at first we would just force them if it were to come to it, or maybe we could be self-sufficient, but according to Logan, they have their ways to stop it, so no one does trade with us. If we truly wanted to force their hand, then it would mean going to war with the board, which would be causing another civil war.

"If that was to happen, then the Dalki will have won this war. So it looks like we have no choice but to accept this invite, but I do want to say one thing. To the vampire leaders, I don't want you to hold back in this fight. Show them the power of the vampires…"

*****

# Chapter 1415 - The Location
At the end of the meeting, no matter what complaints the others had, the result was still the same. The cursed faction had no choice but to agree. It felt strange even in their position; they needed cooperation with others to make things truly work.

If one person held all these resources or power, they could take advantage of that, just like how the Board was now coming together and was doing the same thing.

At this moment, Quinn was strolling through the Cursed ship, a place he hadn't been in for a while, and to his surprise. The ship looked vastly different from what he had remembered. Maybe this was because the whole place was empty as the members weren't inside.

While walking, he didn't encounter anyone. The only things he heard were his echoing footsteps, and once in a while, loud bangs were coming from a nearby place.

'Why are you sulking?' Ray asked, seeing that Quinn had been in a strange mood ever since the meeting had concluded. 'Look, I haven't known you for long, but it's clear, even your footsteps are conveying your sadness when they should be echoing your strength.'

It seemed like both Ray and Vincent had different approaches when talking to Quinn, and he much preferred Vincent's.

'I can hear your thoughts, you know, and it's not like Vincent is dead; if you really want to talk to him, then be my guest, but just because I'm old and from a different time doesn't mean I can't put forth my thoughts.'

'Do you know how long I lived for?'

'Thousands of years, you've bragged quite a few times.' Quinn replied.

'I know, but I don't think you truly know how long that is. It wasn't just that I was alive thousands of years ago, Quinn. I lived for thousands of years as well. During that time, I have watched the humans, helped them in different situations from time to time, but sometimes, I even sat back and watched to see what they would do and how they would act when left to their own devices.

'I tell you this right now Quinn, humans think that they learn from their mistakes, but the truth is, they just end up repeating them again and again. In fact, I wouldn't say just the humans. This applies to everyone, the gods, even me. Sometimes I thought the outcome might be different, but it was always the same.'

Quinn thought about it for a while, eventually decided it was best for him to get it off his chest after all.

'As you said, things feel like they keep on…repeating. I thought that when I had the strength on par with the Supreme Commander or the Vampire King, they would listen and understand, maybe even unite against the Dalki.

'I thought that maybe I could succeed in swaying the decisions of others using my position, but now look at what's going on. Even with all this power I possess, others can still influence the Cursed faction. Risking the lives of those whom I care about. It boils my blood thinking about it, and I thought I might never have to experience something like this again.' Quinn sighed.

'That's because strength isn't just power, Quinn.' Ray explained. 'I was the strongest being in the world, and even though I was undefeated, I still failed more than once to protect those I cared about.

'There are other things that can be seen as power. Think about it, do you think these members of the Board actually have physical strength? Can any of them go head on against you? No, they have made you submit with their resources and intellect; that in itself is a strength as well.

'Still, I'm not telling you to do the same. You should use what you have to your advantage.'

After his little talk, Quinn felt a little better. It was sometimes nice to express one's thoughts and concerns, but Quinn didn't want to do it to the others. He felt like he needed to show that he had a clear head with the position that he was in.

Eventually, he went to the source of the sound of constant fighting, and Quinn had arrived in one of the training rooms. Although, it looked nothing like a training room Quinn had seen before.

It had greatly been modified. A large square inside the training room had been created, with several cameras, motion sensing scanners, and all sorts of other equipment; at the same time, Logan was monitoring all the information while Vincent was by his side learning.

The two of them seemed to be with each other a lot these days. Quinn was just happy to see that Vincent at least had someone else to talk to.

In the centre of the strange chamber they had built was vampire leader Jin. Standing around the edges as well, seemingly waiting for their turn, were the other vampires and Cursed faction leaders.

"Is that enough?" Jin asked, seemingly a little tired and de-energized because of the battle.

"Yep, that's fine," Logan said aloud as the next leader stepped into the chamber. The leaders and Cursed faction members were showing their skills more than ever. It seemed like this was a continuation of their earlier fight to show their power.

Still, there was one request that Quinn had made, and it was that the leaders didn't show their Blood weapons. He had strictly prohibited them from using the Blood Weapons unless they were in a life or death situation.

While Logan was still recording all of the leaders for the VR game, Quinn decided to step next to Sam, as he too looked like he had something on his mind.

"What's wrong?" Quinn broke the ice. Since Ray was able to somewhat clear his mind through conversation, he thought that maybe he could do the same for Sam.

"It's just this whole situation," Sam said. "It doesn't make any sense. Why now of all times, why were they so desperate to use that threat?"

"It was a card that I have never seen them pull, and I can only imagine it would work if all of the members of the Board somewhat agreed upon it, but one of them should have some sense, right? I understand that they don't like the vampires, but I also don't understand what they want to achieve by inviting them all.

"They could have requested for you not to come or prohibited the members of the Cursed faction because they definitely saw the video like everyone else, Quinn. So, why would they invite everyone there."

"You think it's a trap?" Quinn asked.

"I think it's definitely a trap, and why did you tell the vampires to go all out?" Sam asked.

"Because I also think it's a trap, but I want our enemies to think twice about whatever it is they were planning to do," Quinn replied. "What about you Leo, will you be taking part?"

Leo was staring at the current fights with interest, and ever since he had returned, he hadn't said much. He had agreed to help Quinn with whatever he needed his help with and would later try to deal with it.

But there was something on his mind constantly, and it was Erin. In a way, he actually felt like looking after the girl was far more important than his own answers. He was at a crossroads, unsure of what to do.

Still, it was clear that helping fight the Dalki was the most important thing.

"I believe they think I am still human," Leo replied. "They know I am part of the Cursed faction, but I wouldn't be so surprised if they pitted me up against one of the other leaders, which would be an interesting match.

"I don't know what their true intentions are either," Leo said, clearly having overheard them two talking from before. "But I do think that this is something we can all improve from."

Soon all of the leaders' information, how their abilities worked were all recorded into the VR machine. Also, their strength and speed, and now Logan just had to input this into the machine.

At the same time, another worker was doing the same thing for the other side, where all the others who had been invited were to meet and wait. Then when Logan would arrive, he could input the information into the game.

This was Logan Green's part of the deal, and he would also be there to make sure things were fair in the VR Game.

Just then, Sam got a ping on his watch.

"Looks like I got the location where we are meant to meet." Sam smiled. "It's on the Earth."

# Chapter 1416 - A Fool
The special event was a secret event. In the invitation itself there were certain conditions that had to be met, and if the one invited failed to meet any of them, then they would be punished. Of course, there were those that thought it was a bluff by the Board, yet the listed repercussions were simply too severe to risk not turning up.

One of these conditions was that the public was forbidden from learning that something like this would actually be happening. This included all groups, in the Cursed faction, the Graylash faction and even those in the military in the Earthborn group.

The only ones that would be privy to know about the event's existence were the ones supposed to attend. Still, there were a couple of people that had an inkling that something was going on. The two reporters that would be on top of everything. Who were currently on one of the Cursed faction planets, planet Scimal.

They were currently strolling the streets and for once they didn't have their cameras with them.

"Something is happening, I'm telling you. There's no way all leaders of the Cursed faction would simultaneously decide to go out and leave everything to Ivy and Peach!" Bonny reasoned.

"You are overthinking it!" Void insisted. "Many of those in the Shelter are part of the Daisy faction, so why shouldn't Ivy and Peach be in charge? Besides, now that Quinn has brought over those vampire leaders, it just makes sense for the Cursed faction leaders to try and get along with them, no? Also, don't you think there is a lot for them to do in the vampire settlement?"

The two of them stopped at a stall where Void had noticed a nice pair of earrings. He glanced at Bonny's ears for a few seconds, and imagined them on her, and more importantly was wondering if she liked them. It was rare for the two of them to not be out somewhere that might easily get them killed. Even rarer to be together without cameras present, so this was one of his chances.

'All she thinks about is work, work, work. When's the last time I even got a 'thank you' for keeping up with her and also risking my life? No matter where we go I always come with her! Bonny, why can't you notice me…!' Void thought, as he went to pick up the triangle shaped earrings. They appeared to have been made from some type of special crystal, granting them a certain shine in the sunlight.

"Fine, but then you explain to me why every single planet so far has refused to meet with us. Not a single one!" Bonny shouted. "I know something Is up and something big…Oh those look nice." Bonny thought about going over to them.

It was time for Void to act.

"Bonny…I…I want you to have these. Let's just enjoy today together. We can't exactly force them to give us an interview, and we can't just charge into those places. We've been working non-stop. It won't kill us to take one day off for once. This Shelter is a nice impromptu vacation, wouldn't you say? … and there's also something I've been meaning to tell…" Void's face went bright red after that.

——

The Cursed faction, along with the vampire leaders, were already on the move. All the preparations had been made but there was a slight issue. The Cursed faction had no teleporters that led to the Graylash planets or the Earthborn planets either.

It was clearly an issue that they needed to fix, especially since they would now be working closely together, but Quinn wondered now that they were practically in charge of a delegation of vampires, whether they would let him do or make it extra hard.

Left with no other choice, their group was travelling by ship, heading towards one of the Earthborn planets, and now the two groups were stuck in even closer quarters together.

Sam was standing at the dining table ready to make some sort of speech to them all but they still seemed to be bickering.

"Enough!" Sam shouted, clearly frustrated at being the one to have to settle these disputes. "Do I really have to call Quinn each and every time I want to talk to both of our groups? We can't act like this in front of others.

"If anything, the Cursed faction has to display that vampires and humans can happily coexist together. In case you've forgotten because of those traitorous vampires, everyone is still wary of you!"

Raten placed his blades away, whereas Nicu sheathed his bladed cane as well and everyone went to their position on the ship. Sitting on the side, leaning against the wall or at the small dining table in front of them.

"Let's go over this one last time, since we can't have anything go wrong." Sam stated, leading to frustrated sighs on both sides. The Cursed faction's vice leader looked up, annoyed that the one thing both had in common was their unwillingness to listen. He cleared his throat, before continuing.

"Remember, only Sil and Leo were invited out of those from the Cursed faction. Firstly, it doesn't mean that you guys are weaker than the leaders, I know you are all strong.

"Nate, they haven't seen you with the Demon tier Shield, and Layla you have improved beyond everyone. Of course the others, you are our secret weapons. Demon tier beasts, and more, but you have an important task in all of this as well.

"Now, Quinn will be leading the leaders and you two with him while the rest of us will remain on standby, and investigate. We'll do our best to try and find out just what exactly their intentions are behind these invitations. Understand?"

"Understood." The others replied in unison.

"That one, is he strong?" Nicu asked, looking at Sam.

"The others seem to listen to him, so he must be strong." Jake replied standing next to Nicu.

"Sam's strength isn't in combat." Quinn said, appearing behind the two of them. "Although nearly everyone on this ship might be stronger than him, he is a genius when it comes to coordinating things. Is it so strange to see them listen to someone weaker than them?"

To the vampires it was strange, since the leaders were always the strongest in their family. They were the ones who had received the most training and also the blood of the past leaders. There were those that would challenge them at times for their positions, so they had to be strong to defend it.

Also who would listen to them if they were weak that just didn't make any sense, and Quinn could tell by the look on their faces it didn't.

The vampires valued raw strength a lot, and Quinn could tell. It was the reason why many of them accepted his position, but after listening to Ray a bit, he noticed that there were natural leaders who people followed without being strong around him, and Sam was one of them.

"He is a respected person in our group and although we are stronger than him, I'm sure there are many of us who not only would listen to what he told us to do, but would risk our lives for him."

"Risk your lives for someone weaker than you, you humans are certainly foolish." Nicu smiled.

"Oh, well I guess I am a fool, because I am one of them that would risk his life." Quinn pointed out. "Do you really think it's a good idea to be calling your King foolish?"

With that he walked away, leaving Nicu a little red faced, as red as a pale vampire could get anyway.

———

Finally the ship had arrived, and landed. Nathan was there to greet them all. He was surprised to see that many of those from the Cursed faction were present as well and was a little worried about how this was going to go. In the first place, he shouldn't have told the others, but for them he could keep his mouth shut, but that was it.

"I'm sorry Quinn, I know you probably want to bring them with you and their leaders of the Cursed faction, but if they don't have an invitation then they can't come along." Nathan explained.

The Cursed faction members looked at each other, they thought they could have at least returned to Earth, and explored for a bit. Some were even looking forward to it.

"It's okay…just let us know what it's like on the other side." Sam said with a smile. Some of the vampires seemed pleased about this and had a smug look on their faces as they walked past and headed to the teleporter.

The teleporter they were using was an upgraded compared to the standard, it was similar to the ones the vampires used, where a code was imputed unto them that would redirect them to another teleporter, rather than have it lead to the other side directly.

"Those vampires sure act smug for a bunch of old grandpas and granny's!" Nate purposely stated out lourd.

Nathan was a bit nervous seeing them in person. The overwhelming pressure he imagined from them when seeing them on camera he could now feel in front of him.

"Please, the people are waiting on the other side." Nathan said, and with that they all went through, and the portal was closed behind them.

"Well, what are we going to do now?" Linda asked.

"You think me and Logan didn't plan for this?" Sam replied, holding up a strange device.

*****

# Chapter 1417 - A New Energy
Stepping through the teleporter, the Cursed faction and the vampire leaders found themselves back on Earth. The sky was crystal blue as it was only a little past morning. Clouds could be seen up in the air, and even the vampires seemed to have thier heads glued to the sky, taking everything in around them.

The air always just felt fresher here compared to the other places as the scent of the ocean wafted into their nostrils. The group looked around and found themselves in a military base. They were out in the open rather than placed in a room, unlike where the usual teleporters would be based. It was certainly strange, as if someone had just moved it into a middle of an open area.

What was surprising more than anything, or unsurprising, was the lack of personnel.

Right now, they were on one large strip of black ground. In the distance, they could see soldiers doing routines. However, there was no one here to guide them, no one to greet them or anything, just a large travel ship placed about hundreds of meters away on the strip.

In a way, Quinn expected this to half be the trap, and there would just be countless of travellers or Earthborn group members having surrounded them.

If not, then at least those that would be there to keep an eye on the vampires from causing a scare, but there was nothing.

"It looks like we are at a military base, and there isn't anyone around this place. Is there a reason for this?" Quinn spoke out loud. Usually, Quinn wouldn't comment so much on the area around him, but there was a specific reason why he was doing so.

It was so that a certain group that was left behind could know what was going on here.

"That's because I'm your guide," Nathan replied. "Any question you have, what you will be doing, where you will be going, I have all the information. The Board seems to have taken extra care into making sure that no one knows about this. Although I won't be participating in the event, I will be there. They chose me due to my relationship with the Cursed faction and the Earthborn group."

With that said, Nathan started to walk up ahead, and they all started to board the ship to head to their next destination. Quinn wanted to ask Nathan many questions, and he continued to comment on all the things around him, only a little quieter so Nathan wouldn't overhear.

Although Nathan had helped him out in the past, he remembered Sam's warning to not trust him for now. They weren't sure about who was on who's side. So it would be easy to treat anyone working under the Board as an enemy for now, which meant those in the Earthborn group.

"So this is where we came from… it's quite beautiful." Sunny stated, looking outside.

"Have you guys never…been to earth?" Nathan asked.

"No, we tried to cut ties with humans as much as possible after our move." Sunny replied. "However, we would hear stories of this place, and it is just as beautiful as they described it. It's a shame that not all vampires can experience this." While speaking, Sunny was constantly playing with the ring on her finger.

All of the leaders had a ring that allowed them to stay in the sunlight as long as possible, so Quinn didn't worry about this issue. After travelling over a large sea, they saw land again, and in the distance, Quinn could see something he hadn't seen for a long time.

There was a gigantic building that looked like a stadium, but from the top down, it looked like a flower sprouting. He had visited this place before during the school tournament, and now, they were back here again.

Only there was a huge difference; the whole city, including the military base, was empty. Trains, the mechs, and other things they had seen before, none of them were in operation.

"Is this the Board's doing?" Quinn asked.

"Kind of," Nathan replied. "They did ask to clear-off this area, but remember that most of the Earthborn group are actually out fighting. The Board families have their production setup elsewhere and don't actually rely on military help too much.

"They rely on independent travellers or small Guilds. This is why before we arrive there, I have a message from Supreme Commander Sach. I'm sorry, Quinn, that I could not stop something like this. When together, remember to keep up appearances."

Quinn could somewhat guess what he meant by the message. He was directing him to pretend that they didn't know each other or were friends, and this wasn't the Sach that could pull strings.

"And I have a message from myself as well. Over the last few days, I have struggled to decide whether I am a member of the Cursed faction or the Earthborn group, but I think it doesn't matter. I work for the Supreme Commander, who listens to you, Quinn.

"For now, I think it's best if you treat the Board as a separate group that just has the power to make not just the Earthborn group but the others too to do its bidding as well."

This had made Quinn happy a bit; he never had any disliking for Nathan, even when they were at school. Still, he would keep Sam's warning in mind.

The ship had gone to the large flower-like stadium, which looked slightly remodelled. Instead of seats where everyone would view a large grand event, they just had converted them into large glass boxes that one could see through; for now, though, they were all vacant.

"Where is everyone?" Sil asked.

"All participants of this event are in the canteen, which for the time being, has been converted into a dining hall. It will be a chance for everyone to introduce themselves, including members of the Board, before the event starts." Nathan explained.

"They don't want you to think of this event as just a fight, but a true introduction of both sides, behind the eyes of the public."

The ship eventually landed around the edge of a base, and all of the leaders, including Quinn himself, were on guard. In all honesty, it was the same for Nathan. After a few moments, they were walking through a long tunnel heading to the canteen area.

There was one person that Quinn could rely on, Leo. He could see anything that was coming. They walked for a long time, and eventually, the leaders, Quinn, and everyone else noticed something.

They stopped in their tracks before they had even reached the end of the tunnel that would take them to the main building area. The only ones who were still moving were Sil and Nathan until they too noticed the others.

"What's wrong?" Nathan asked and was slightly worried because the look on Quinn's face wasn't relaxed.

"We can smell…blood," Quinn replied.

After a few moments, Quinn decided to keep walking forward, and this time he stayed in front, instead of Nathan and the others, with Leo and Sil by his side. They soon entered the Main building and had gone down a flight of stairs.

"How do you know where the canteen is?" Nathan asked.

"I don't; I'm just following the smell."

They had finally reached two large double doors, and they could hear the sound of several people talking. They were sure that the smell was coming from there.

"This is where everyone has gathered. They are waiting for you inside." Nathan said.

Leo nodded his head, confirming Nathan's words. He could sense some familiar energies inside and some unfamiliar ones simultaneously, but before letting Quinn go inside, he grabbed the latter's arm.

"Quinn, we have to be cautious. No one seems to be dead inside…but I sense a white energy from one of them." Leo explained.

"A white energy… Do you mean Qi?" Quinn asked.

Leo shook his head.

"I do sense Qi, but this white energy that I sense, it was the same energy that was present in Laxmus."

*****
# Chapter 1418 - A Gift To The V
After fighting with Laxmus, Quinn talked about it a lot with Vincent and his newly found ancestor Ray. If what Leo was saying was true, perhaps this white energy meant that it belonged to a god.

'Could it be Bliss?' Quinn thought.

'I see your friend has the Dragon eyes' power if he says he can see energies. Although white is the colour of the energy emitted from the gods, it does not necessarily mean it is a god.' Ray explained. 'In the first place, it could be a dormant being that the person is unaware of, it could be a god, like you think, or perhaps like this Laxmus person you talked about, it just means they have a closer connection to the god.

'This would mean that they are able to allow others to borrow their power more freely.' Ray explained.

Now there was more than one thing for Quinn to worry about, he was already concerned about the smell of blood coming from this room, but now there was possibly a threat as significant as Laxmus.

"Quinn, are you okay?" Nathan called out to him. "The others probably know about your arrival, so it's best if we go in."

Nathan was right. Whatever the case was, Quinn had to enter that room eventually, and standing outside would do nothing. At least he knew a little about what to expect. Standing in front, Quinn pushed the door open, and the grand room was revealed.

It was hard to imagine that the room they were looking at used to be a canteen because they had done an excellent job making it look like a grand ballroom. The place reminded Quinn of when he went to meet the other generals when he was a teacher for a short time.

There was red carpet covering the whole floor. Tables filled with expensive appetisers and real food. While a golden rug led from the door they had entered, leading up to a stage ahead. Currently, there was no one present on the stage. However, the room was filled with familiar faces.

Many familiar faces that Quinn had seen before were spread around the room.

"Well, I excepted that this might be the whole point of the event, and the main star has arrived," Owen said, the first person who was there to greet Quinn. He looked the same as always with the fan covering his face, in his white robes and long hair.

He walked over quickly to Quinn and gave a respectful bow, and next to him were two others from the Graylash family. One was Grim Graylash Owen's grandfather, while the other was Hermes. Who Quinn had seen a few times but had never witnessed his strength.

Based on those in the room and those invited from the Cursed faction, Quinn had assumed that the ones invited were considered the strongest. Which was why Sil and Leo had been selected. So Hermes had to have great strength that Quinn hadn't witnessed before.

"It has been a while, Owen. You have grown a lot since the last time I saw you. In strength, I mean." Quinn praised him. "It's good to see that the rest of you are alive in this tough fight as well."

Hearing this, Owen couldn't help but laugh.

"I have grown, Quinn. In comparison to you, I feel like I have done nothing, and looking at these fine people behind you, you never cease to amaze me. I welcome you all, and I hope that we will all treat each other as friends, a friend of Quinn's is a friend of mine."

While Owen was quite respectful, some of the leaders had already locked eyes with Grim and Hermes. It was almost as if they were having a battle with just their eyes.

"Cool it," Quinn snapped at those behind him.

"Quinn, I see you have made it." Another said, walking over. This time it was the Supreme commander Sach and by his side was Samantha. His greeting was a little more formal, and they had chosen to stay quite a distance away from the others.

Sach didn't want to appear too close to Quinn, but he could still greet him. After all, Sach, Owen and Quinn were the superpowers of the world. It wouldn't look out of place to see these three together.

"He's a…" Nicu was about to say something, but Quinn quickly turned around, looking at all the leaders. It was a clear sign for none of them to say anything, but they were right. Sach was a vampire.

'I see, so Quinn has his inside people in all of this, and it seems he is well respected among the others.' Sunny noticed as she looked around.

"Sach, do you smell it?" Quinn asked.

"I do, but honestly, just like you and the others, we don't know much about this. Everything has been organised by them. I assume Logan is on standby?" Sach asked.

Logan was meant to be looking after the game system, and for him, they would give him the direct coordinates when the fight was to start. Then he could input all the information into the teleporter and travel in when needed.

Why didn't they do this with everyone, Quinn had no idea, but perhaps they still had a level of trust in Logan due to him being on the Board.

Others didn't come and greet Quinn, maybe there would have been others, but none of the other generals that would be participating in this event had chosen to. They stayed their distance away, and the vampires were following Quinn around like he was their Royal guard.

After talking a bit to Sach and Owen, Quinn headed over to another place because he could see Mona there. She was busy stuffing her face full of all the different food. So much that it didn't seem like she had even noticed Quinn and the others arriving.

Still, there was something quite noticeable about her, and it was something quite large standing by her side.

Eventually, she turned around and gave a smile while heading to her table with the large figure.

"Mona…you…you…" Quinn didn't know what to say.

By her side was Oscar. The only thing was he was suited up in full armour, and he held a box by his side, which Quinn assumed was his head. Which was why no one recognised him.

"I told everyone that this is a beast under my control," Mona whispered, leaning forward. Once again, though, the other vampires could tell that it wasn't human or a beast, but since Quinn made it clear the first time, the others didn't react, although they were left guessing trying to figure out exactly what it was.

It was a smell that they did not recognise but smelt somewhat familiar, like that of an undead.

Looking around the room, Quinn could also see others that were standing separate from the rest.

One had no weapons on his body but was in a sleeveless hoodie with his head covered. Then, one wore a strange mask with thin red splits for its eyes. The body looked quite thin and short.

Looking around more, there were people Quinn hadn't seen, but he could tell they were all strong.

"Those are the Unranked as they are known. Top Travellers that never joined any Faction." Nathan said.

At that moment, Leo came up to Quinn and whispered in his ear that it was one of them that had the strange white energy that he could sense. Because of this, Quinn thought it might be best to go over and talk to them.

He would leave the vampires on their own temporarily for a while. It didn't look like anyone was willing to approach the leaders in the first place.

Just as Quinn was about to move, he stopped. As certain members started to walk onto the stage.

Each one of them, different ages, all of them men and all wearing black suits. By their side, each of them had two guards each. These men were those that were known as the Board.

'You know if you wanted to, you could just force them all to do your bidding now.' Ray commented. 'Your strong, right? Stronger than any in the room and those protecting them. If it was me, I would go right up to their faces and ask them what game they think they are playing.'

Although Quinn actually felt like doing that and had Ray said, he had learnt from Logan that it would be mostly useless to treat them in such a way.

The ten stood there proud. In the centre was an old man with a long beard. He used a walking stick to help him stand up. It was a strange sight because he knew another old man who would use a walking stick. Yet, he was one of the strongest people he had ever met.

Yet here, a human who was old was so weak.

"I welcome all of you to come today. We thank all of you deeply for caring enough to come here. The contents of the letters are true. We have arranged this event because we believe this is important for our future. Just like in the past when they would hold the Olympics between different countries, we wish to hold an event that will bring these two new races together." The old man said.

"Even in the past, during times of war, they would unite together for this event, which is why I wish to do the same. I hope after this we will learn more from each other. As a welcome to our new guest we have a treat.

"To Quinn, and his followers."

Hearing the word 'Followers,' had greatly angered the leaders. They weren't just the king's followers.

"We have a gift for you." The Old man said.

The curtain was then drawn, and several young women could be seen standing there in view. There were fourteen of them in total. There were servants by their side, who carried out wine glasses, and held them just beneath the girls. It was a strange sight, to say the least.

"We hope that you accept our gift." The man said, and at the same time, each of them pulled out a knife and slit the palm of their hands, allowing the blood to fall into the glasses. The girls looked frightened and in pain.

Some of the women had failed to cut deep enough to fill the glass, and had picked up the knife again to cut their hands a second time. Even cutting their other hands.

And the generals and the others, seeing this scene, looked at it in discomfort. They felt disgusted that they had to do such things, and looked towards the vampires.

Standing in front of them though, was Quinn with his hands clenched.

"STOP!" Quinn shouted from down below. "Just what do you think you are doing?!"

Before they, or anyone could react, Quinn had onto the stage and went right past all of the members of the Board to the women at the very back.

"I order you all to stop!" Quinn shouted with his eyes glowing red, and in an instant, they all listened and dropped the knives.

"You better have a good explanation for this," Quinn asked.

*****

# Chapter 1419 - I'm The Villain
Seeing Quinn standing there on stage, everyone still on the floor was quite shocked. The women were frozen in place, not moving at all, and blood was still dripping down from their cuts.

Some hadn't even seen Quinn move, while the few who were able to follow his movements could tell he was incredibly fast.

The table of the Unranked had the most interesting expression. There were five of them sitting at the table in total.

"The Cursed faction's leader is certainly brave." One said.

"Or stupid is another way to look at it. The guards have now surrounded him, and I know some of those Travelers. They are no simple fighters." Another person added.

The sleeveless hooded man, who had his arms crossed, chuckled.

"For some reason, I think he isn't too afraid of them."

Since an intruder had reached the stage, the guards there to protect their Board members wasted no time going in for the attack. Once again, the fastest one was a Traveler who had two daggers, and his power focused on speed. He pulled out his daggers, lighting up slightly green.

'Last time that invisible force hit me, I don't know what it was, but that man was different and special, but I have to prove my worth; otherwise, they will never trust me again.'

This man was perhaps just as fast as Quinn if Quinn didn't use his beast gear, which was an impressive feat, but that didn't matter.

Turning towards the man, Quinn's eyes continued to glow red. This often happened when he was filled with rage, and it was clear at this moment he was.

"Down!" Quinn commanded.

The Traveler went to his knees instantly, falling to the floor.

"Stay," Quinn ordered again, and no matter what the traveler tried to do, he could no longer move. He tried his best to control his body, but it was as if the words said seconds ago were ringing through his head, and his brain was no longer in charge.

'What is going on…last time, I was hit with some strange energy, but this is…humiliating.' The Traveler gritted his teeth, but what was even worse was when he was looking at Quinn's eyes, he was afraid of what he would say next.

So far, his body had listened to every word the young man said, and if Quinn ordered him to kill himself, he felt like his body would listen. This sent shivers down his entire body, and now he knew he wanted nothing to do with this person. No amount of money was worth his life.

At the tables, the Generals had experienced a familiar scene before, with Head general Innu, although he was strong, he wasn't the best, and some were better than him, which was why they were surprised to see the same scene happening to someone with such regard.

The women, the Traveler, and the servants by their side were all suffering from Quinn's influence skill. Everyone was stunned by Quinn's display of strength, especially those witnessing it for the first time.

"I told you he would have no trouble, but this is beyond what I expected." The sleeveless man said. "He has great strength. Also, this mysterious power is quite incomprehensible."

They weren't the only ones shocked by this either. Based on the human speed they witnessed for the half of second they could, they assumed that he would have been quite strong. They had even seen many of those in the Cursed faction perform well.

Yet, Quinn was able to have so many under his control.

"His influence ability, I think it's on par with the originals… no, it might be beyond that," Jin commented.

It had been so long since Quinn had used his influence skill. He practically found it useless against those that were strong. Since they also tended to have a strong mind, and it didn't work against beasts or the Dalki.

However, his Charm stat had been fully unlocked since then, bringing it up to a 100.

"Are you going to explain what you are doing right now, creating this type of scene, or do I have to force an answer out of you?" Quinn asked, clearly still irritated.

Some Board members had gritted their teeth and looked like they were about to say something until the old man stepped out front.

"Quinn… we mean no disrespect. We know vampires consume blood, so we thought to bring the freshest blood right to your doorsteps." The old man replied.

'I hate people like this.' Ray said in Quinn's mind, and Quinn was inclined to agree.

The way he was speaking made it sound like it was meant to be a nice gesture, but clearly, it was only meant to look that way for now. Later on, this would create trouble for the vampires. Quinn didn't need to think more to understand that all this was a set-up to make it vilify the vampires' image.

"You really think like that?" Quinn smiled. "I have claimed to be a vampire for a long time, and unlike Oscar, who wished to learn more about us, not once did you ask me about the vampires.

"This room smells of blood. I bet you were hoping to catch some type of reaction, it might not be visible to the others, but you know our noses are sensitive. I can smell it all over the walls. Then if that didn't work, you had this little act prepared, hoping that direct blood might work as well.

"I wouldn't be surprised if you have this whole room recorded to see if one of the leaders reacts to it. I… am disappointed in you. You, who are meant to be at the top, act like this, but worst of all, the reason why I'm so annoyed is that you are even hurting your own kind, forcing them against their will just to do this!" Quinn yelled.

The other Travelers had yet to move; they were waiting for orders from the respective board members. At the same time, those below were enjoying the spectacle, for right now, there weren't actually many on the Board's side.

Some disliked the idea of working with the vampires, but simply put, the Board had blackmailed nearly everyone in the room in some way to get here, which was why they weren't coming out to defend the Board.

"Let's say you are right." The old man said. "However, look at it from our point of view. We have no clue what your plan is, Quinn, and at the same time, did you ask us how many of us felt when you brought the vampires to our lands?… Did you even request the Board, the Earthborn group, or asked the military if we agreed to bring them?

"We have tried to be respectful and are learning about them, and there is one more thing you are wrong about. We didn't force any of these women to take part, and they are being paid a large sum for this.

"For something as small as this, they will never have to worry about their expenses or their families again for as long as they live. We didn't force anyone, and hundreds of others would be willing to jump at an opportunity like that.

"So go on, stop them, stop them and carry on doing what you wish and forcing everyone to follow your decisions." The old man said.

Hearing this, Quinn turned over to the woman.

"I will cancel my control over you, but your blood will be wasted on these. We don't need blood and whatever they are offering you… I promise that I will do the same. A home, a place to live and protection, and no worries for the rest of your lives like the rest of the Cursed faction."

Within a blink, Quinn's eyes no longer glowed red, and everyone under the influence skill could move again. However, it didn't take long for the women to decide and continued to cut the palm of their hands, drawing it into the cup until it was full.

'Why… Why are they still cutting their hands… did they not believe what I said? Why are they following his word over mine.' Quinn couldn't understand. 'Is it because they don't see me as one of them?'

When one of the women's cups was filled, she walked over to where Quinn was, her legs shaking, and handed over the cup to him. A forced smile was on her face.

It looked like the plan was to fill each of the cups and hand it to the leaders.

"Why?" Quinn said out loud and raised his hand; simultaneously, all of the blood started to move out from the cups and went towards him, forming a large ball of blood. He was using his absolute blood control powers in front of them all.

"You want to make these vampires into villains in the time of war, but I won't let you," Quinn said. "I won't let your blood go to waste. Yes, I made all those decisions without asking you; if you want the world to hate someone, then hate me. I'll be your villain."

At that moment, Quinn opened his mouth wide, and all the blood flowed into his body.
