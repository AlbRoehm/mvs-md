# Chapter 1280 - A Familiar Person
Quinn couldn't quite believe what he was seeing. Another Demon tier beast had appeared on the island or more accurately in the sea. What's more, it seemed to be a beast he was all too familiar with.

When first coming to the island, he had run into it and it had ended up demolishing Logan's precious submarine. On their second visit, Quinn had seen Mona tame the beast, a feat so amazing that she might be the only one able to achieve such a thing, with the exception of Sil perhaps, but he clearly remembered that the Kraken had not been a Demon tier beast at the time.

The confusing part was that Mona had once claimed that she didn't think it possible for her to be able to control a Demon tier beast, due to the way her ability worked. She only had enough MC cells to control a Demi-god tier beast, with perhaps a few lower tier ones on top of that.

After learning that beasts like Muddy and Tails could evolve, it wasn't out of the realm of possibility that the Kraken beast could evolve as well, however Quinn would have thought that in that case it should have broken free from Mona's control. Fortunately, the one beside him decided to solve that mystery for him.

"Mona's role in this war had always been bigger than she could ever imagine." Eno proceeded to explain, while they all continued to watch her fight off the incoming spaceships… "I took her in to make sure she would be able to fulfill her role, the only thing she really needed was some guidance.

"People often believe to know everything there is to know about their own ability, especially one passed down in a family, but those are usually the ones who lack creativity. When it comes to abilities, it never hurts to try and think outside the box."

"For example, once a beast has been put under control using the taming ability, a link will have already been established between the tamer and the beast. No matter how strong the beast gets or how weak she would grow, there is no getting out for the beast unless the controller either wills it so… or dies."

"In most instances, it's easier to capture a higher tier beast to grow stronger than to evolve one. On the other hand, how many could claim to be able to get a Demi-god tier beast under their control in the first place. Once captured it was worth the investment to make it evolve." Eno finished his explanations.

The others hearing this, were amazed that they had an actual Demon tier beast fighting on their side. Even faced with the large number of enemies in front of them, they now felt some confidence that perhaps they weren't as doomed as they had come to believe.

Losing the teleporter had been a bitter pill to swallow, not only because it had cut off their path of retreat, but also because they could no longer expect any backup from Sil, one of their strongest members. They all knew how much of a blow this was to the team, so the realization that Eno had prepared something none of them had ever considered was very reassuring.

Unfortunately, despite Mona doing her best to get rid of as many of those ships exiting those portals, there were just far too many for her and the Kraken to deal with on their own. It didn't take long for a number of them to make it past her.

Seeing this, the others were preparing to use their abilities to knock the ships out of the sky, or block the incoming energy blasts that were able to be shot out from the ships. At the moment, the group could see two different types of ships they could make out, one larger but slower, the other faster and more mobile.

The former seemed to be dropships similar to the ones the Graylash group had used when they had gone up against the Sunshield family, unless modified they should have around two dozen people inside. The latter were obviously ones meant to attack, fast and agile with one or two pilots inside. Although Mona had concentrated on taking them out, currently a group of them was heading straight for the castle, their energy blasters ready to fire.

In total, six ships had managed to get past the Kraken, their blasters could be seen charging up, but before any of the Cursed faction could make their move, a gust of wind could be felt and the next second, a large shadow was cast over them all.

"The…the Dragon!" Layla called out. She had her bow ready but quickly put it down when she could only see its back.

The small ships fired their energy blasts, but the Demon tier beast didn't even show any signs that it had noticed being hit. It seemed indifferent to the attacks and once it was close enough it opened its maw wide to reveal an orange light from behind its fangs.

The next second a stream of fire came bursting out, engulfing two of the ships in flames. When the Dragon stopped its fire breath the small ships could no longer be seen. Normally, at least a few parts would have fallen to ground, yet it was as if it had just disappeared, not even leaving behind any ash.

The Dragon didn't stop there, using its large tail in lightning fast manner it struck three other ships down, and with a flap of it's giant wing, one of the ships was thrown off balance before it crashed into it with its giant jaw.

The six small spaceships were no match at all for the giant Demon tier beast. After getting rid of the little flying annoyances that had entered its flight space, the Dragon seemed to have calmed down, returning to its apparently favorite location. When it landed it shook the whole castle that the Cursed group were on.

"Well, it looks like as long as we have him on our side, we won't lose this fight!" Fex exclaimed, in amazement. It was nice knowing that a beast they had once run from with their lives on the line was now on their side.

As quickly as things had started to look up though, they also started to look down again.

Having learned from the mistakes of their predecessors, most ships had made the smart decision to fly around the area of the Kraken's current location. At the same time, due to the Dragon's performance, instead of flying over the island and angering the beast, the dropships had decided to land on the outer edges, allowing the people on board to safely get out. However, the forces didn't stop there, as several underwater boats that had been hiding, also came onto shore.

"They were in the sea as well!" Nate shouted, seeing as one of the ships opened, and several people were seen coming out from the ship.

From a distance, the others couldn't tell if they were human or vampires, but Quinn could use his Inspect skill and he was quite surprised about the outcome, for there were a mixture of vampires and humans among the attackers.

All of the men that had come out were wearing a black mask that covered their faces, with only slits over their eyes, so it was impossible for anyone but Quinn to tell at a glance. There seemed to be one human for every twenty or so vampires.

'How have they managed to gather this many forces? Wasn't Jim supposed to be a vampire who broke off on his own? Even if he somehow managed to take control over all the spies sent out by the vampires, would they really amount to this many?' Quinn thought.

Something wasn't adding up, and he knew the one who would know the answer. In the first place, where were their own reinforcements? Sure, the teleporter had just been destroyed, but what about all the clones that Eno had spread around the place?

"Their forces are far larger than what we had estimated. We need to proceed with the plan instead of just looking at what is happening." Sam rallied the Cursed group, trying to knock everyone out of their daze. "They are attacking from all over the island, and will slowly be coming forward. We need to stick to the plan and start it now!"

"How are we meant to proceed with the plan when there's only us?" Linda questioned him. "We need to come up with another idea, otherwise their numbers will simply overwhelm us. There has to be thousands of them while we number less than twenty, and I'm sure they have some strong ones among them."

Gritting his teeth, Sam had to admit that their plan wasn't looking too feasible right now. If only they could somehow coordinate their attacks with the Dragon… Unfortunately, if that would have been that easy, Eno wouldn't have had to work together with the Cursed faction, in hopes of Sil taking control over the Demon tier beast.

Without him, not only was it impossible but also risky. What's more, if their enemies were attacking with this many people, they surely had to have some trump card that would allow them to deal with the Demon tier beast…

So while it was in the centre of the island, they had to stop anyone from getting close.

"I might not have a way to overpower them, but I have something that should be able to slow them down." Quinn said. "Do you think that will be enough for the rest of you to proceed with the plan as you originally intended? I'm sorry that I wasn't there when you were discussing the plan earlier, but I was doing something important." Quinn said, holding onto the amulets and closing his eyes, before he mumbled.

"I'll leave this side to you then."

Taking Full Control, Quinn saw everything that the Roseus tree did, making it easy for him to lead the army of beasts where they were needed.

As for the one controlling his body at the moment, it was none other than Vincent. Opening his eyes, 'Quinn' now gave off a different vibe.

"Tell me, what I need to do." Vincent requested.

'It's that other person… again.' Layla noticed, but she wasn't the only one to have noticed something.

'This… 'person' isn't Quinn right now… but why do I get a familiar feeling from him?' Eno wondered.

*****

# Chapter 1281 - Not Your Friend
Something that Quinn had never thought about was the changes that happened each time Vincent would be in control over his body. The fluctuations in one's voice, the energy that surrounded them, the rhythm of their heartbeat and more, all would be determined by the person who was in control of a body.

The human mind was far more incredible than many might think, noticing those changes Eno could tell almost immediately that someone else had taken over Quinn's body. On top of that, the old vampire had also heard the words his 'grandson' had mumbled just before that.

Finally, when Vincent spoke, Eno was convinced that he wasn't Quinn.

"Tell me, what I need to do?" Vincent requested.

Sam and the others had already grouped up, ready to head off into their positions. They had decided to split up into four different groups covering each side of where the enemy would come from.

Linda, Wevil and Peter as one group, Sam, Nate and Layla as another, with Dennis and Fex as the third group. The fourth group would be the Blades, but judging by the fact they had yet to arrive at the top of the castle despite everything happening outside, they seemed to be busy…

'If they're still not here, it should mean that Vorden and Raten are still not done with their evolution and Borden must be staying by their side to guard them.' Sam thought, trying to think of a way to make up for the loss of the Blades.

'Wait, maybe Peter would be a good replacement, after all he has those two by his side.' But when Sam looked up, Peter was nowhere to be seen.

"Peter, where the hell is Peter?" Sam questioned, and realised that he had never come up with the rest. Now he had to come up with another idea.

Honestly he was worried that if they thinned out any of the three groups, especially with Peter gone, it would be too much for the groups to handle.

"I suggest, the three groups cover the East, West, and South sides." Sam spoke up. "At the moment, Mona is doing a great job stopping those at the North side, so we should be able to leave it be for now. Hopefully she can hold off long enough for the Blades to reinforce her."

If that wasn't the case, then Sam would have to try to act while on the ground, whichever group was doing best, they could shuffle one person to try and help.

"What about us?" Vincent asked. "What will the three of us be doing?"

"Us three, need to make sure that thing is under control and we will be staying by its side at all times." Brock answered looking down at the Dragon.

Vincent quickly understood. The enemy would have to send out their strongest members to deal with the Demon tier beast. Perhaps they would ignore the rest of the Cursed faction and head straight for the beast, which was why supposedly the three strongest members had been told to keep guard.

"I have a suggestion to make. I can help out with protecting the North side, the rest of you focus on covering your sides." Vincent spoke as he lifted his hand to open the Shadow space. Soon four Dalki could be seen appearing out in the open. The only thing was when they appeared they just stood there in place.

'Ah, right Quinn needs to control them.' Vincent thought. 'Well, he said he shares his vision with the Demon tier plant thing, so hopefully he can direct them where to go on the whole island, so I hope he can see this and come back soon.'

"Dalki!" Some of them shouted in surprise seeing the beast, even Eno looked a little bit shocked.

"I see, the boy has been really busy. What a powerful item he has at his disposal. Once again he has surpassed my expectations." Eno complimented the real Quinn, instead of the whoever was in his body.

"What about Sil?" Layla asked. "Can't Quinn travel to Alex with his shadow and get Sil?"

Sam shook his head, as he released the mistake he had made. He was so confident in the teleporters he thought something like this wouldn't have happened.

"Alex decided to head with Andrew to one of the Earthborn group planets. Apparently Andrew needed to create a few things for their group to help in the battle that was coming up, and Alex asked to go along. He has already done so much for us. I thought we could grant him this favour and help out Andrew. I don't know where he is at the moment. The only thing I can do is ask for someone in the Cursed ship to try and locate him and head back to the Cursed ship."

While Sam was delivering the news, It didn't take long for Quinn to notice the presence of the Dalki, so he switched with Vincent for a second, and gave the Dalki simple commands, to head just a little out into the north jungle, and to attack whatever came their way. Straight away the Dalki moved.

"I've sent the message, all we can do is wait, but we need to act as well." Sam said, and the rest of the groups were now moving.

Switching, control back, Vincent was in Quinn's body once again, and only the three of them now remained on the castle roof.

Vincent, was ready to act, to follow along with these two, but before he could take a step forward, Eno appeared in front of him with his blood armour and looked him directly in the eye.

"It's apparent that you're not Quinn, so tell me who you are? Why does it feel like I know you… and you better make sure I like the answer!" Eno demanded.

———

Now in Full Control of the Roseus tree, Quinn could feel all of the beasts that had been marked over the island, and in the short time he had given it a command, he realised that it had done a far better job than he realised.

Quinn had an army of beasts at his disposal.

'Thank you for all dressing the same. You've just made my job a lot easier.' Quinn thought as he gave all the beasts a simple command, to attack the people who were wearing those strange black masks.

The beasts soon were seen coming out of the jungle, and onto the sand, jumping towards the people in black masks. Instantly, they attacked using their blood powers, throwing out their red aura. Some beasts were dealt with quickly, while others were strong enough to ignore the first barrage of attacks, charging into their opponents.

"What is going on? Why are all the beasts suddenly attacking us, this has never happened before!" One of the men shouted, as he punched to slice a beast in half with his red blood aura, but soon a strange thought had come out from one of the trees wrapping around his neck.

Just like with the amulet, Quinn was able to use his energy to strengthen the Marked. Instead of using his own energy, or the one of the tree that was already pretty tapped after taking control over so many beasts, the Vampire Lord had started to drain the lower tier beasts who were close to dying. Those that were higher tiers Quinn had decided to give this extra energy he had taken. Especially with more difficult opponents.

It seemed like there were vampires and humans at all different types of levels on the island.

Sam, Nate and Layla were the first ones to reach their position on the East side. It was not too far from where the Demon tier beast was, and they were meant to stick together. That's when Nate had spotted a masked person come out from the trees towards them.

Nate and Sam both were ready to use their blood powers and Layla also had readied an arrow, but soon they saw a gorilla-like beast jump towards the masked invader. The beast grabbed the poor man's legs from underneath pulling him onto the ground, and immediately with its large hands it started to pound at the masked man over and over until he was dead.

The gorilla beast looked at the three of them, and then quickly looked away heading back into the forest.

"What the hell was that? Did that beast just help us?" Nate asked, rubbing his eyes as if to check if something was wrong with them.

Layla was the only one who had an idea of what had possibly happened, and it looked like Wevil and Linda who had witnessed the same thing already had figured it out. After all, there was one thing on the island that should be able to control beasts aside from Mona.

"Does it actually belong to us this time, but how?" Wevil asked.

"I don't know, but if I was to guess, my bet is it's something to do with Quinn." Linda shrugged.

——

After a brief conversation, Vincent, Brock and Eno jumped down from the castle, landing in the empty centre where the Demon tree, beast and tablet were.

"I see now… so the tree was incomplete before. No wonder, I could tell that it would do us no harm. It looks like I was right to keep it here." Eno mumbled to himself, as he walked past the tree, and started to head towards the dragon.

As for Vincent, he still had complicated feelings when thinking about the conversation he just had with Eno.

'Quinn… I'm sorry. I don't know what will happen after this fight, but I hope you can forgive me for telling him that. It was the only way to make him trust us…'

It was then, when Eno had taken one step too far that the Demon tier dragons beast had turned around, and looked towards the three of them. Its eyes stared at Eno, Brock and Vincent and it didn't look friendly at all.

"You three need to get out NOW! The Demon tier beast is no longer listening to me!" Somebody's voice shouted in all three of their heads at the same time.

Both Richard, and Brock didn't recognise the voice, but Vincent did. It was Ray's, and it appeared as the three of them were in for a far tougher job than they had signed up for.

# Chapter 1282 - Protect My Brothers
Using the power of the Roseus tree, Quinn was able to coordinate the marked beasts to help out the Cursed faction in holding off the enemy. However, at the end of the day, they were just beasts, whereas nearly all of the enemy forces consisted of vampires who had access to super strength, great speed and blood powers.

It also didn't help that thanks to a certain family that had been on the island for a while now the strongest beasts that the tree had been able to mark were at the King tier. Quinn could use the power of the tree to make them somewhat stronger but even that could only do so much against their foes' teamwork.

Then there were also the stronger vampires who were able to ignore the beasts in the jungle and were heading straight towards the Demon tier beast. It was the second line of defence's job to intercept them.

The group stationed at the East section consisted of Sam, Layla and Nate. Although he was the weakest of the bunch, just barely being a noble vampire, Sam stood at the front. Nate was also a strong vampire at the noble level, and despite being turned by Sam, had grown to become stronger than him. This was why Sam had decided to stay a bit at the back. As for Layla, she had scaled one of the trees and took the high ground. .

Looking carefully she noticed some of the trees moving, and quickly held up five fingers on one hand, signalling the two from below.

"You haven't learnt how to use Blood Hardening yet, have you?" Nate asked.

Sam shook his head, a little embarrassed. He had only ever learned the basics of using his blood skills. While the rest had continuously trained whenever they could, he had been left to deal with the administrative tasks for the Cursed faction, keeping it running.

It was also the reason why their teams consisted of three members, instead of two like the other groups. The first to attack was Layla, as she placed five arrows in her bow and fired them all at once.

Each one of them had been embedded with Qi. As they reached the vampires, one of them had attempted to grab onto the arrow, but it was too powerful for him to hold onto and went straight through his head killing him on the spot.

Another of the vampires managed to move in time, letting the arrow hit the tree, but seeing this, Layla tried out her new skill. Using her telekinesis powers she made the arrow spin, also adding another surge of her Qi.

'My body still can't handle the amount of Qi I have, but somehow it's easy enough to share my Qi when I use it in tandem with my telekinesis powers!' Layla's thought distracted her for a brief moment and she ended up putting in a little too much power. The whole width of the tree exploded and the arrow carried on heading towards one of the black masked men.

The masked man was lucky, due to the arrow shaft exploding with the force of Qi, the only thing that had managed to hit him was the arrow head. Still, there was one person who wouldn't miss this opportunity, and that was Sam.

He had been patiently waiting for an opportunity to help out. The masked man managed to parry the arrowhead, yet three blood swipes followed closely behind it, hitting him and finishing him off instantly.

'My blood powers aren't any weaker than theirs. I can still help.' Sam thought.

As for the other arrows that Layla had fired off, their targets seemed to be more skilled, as they had been able to strike down the arrow at the right time, or hit it with blood attacks of their own, swaying their path.

'Looks like there are some strong ones in the group, but there are some strong ones in our group as well.' Layla thought.

She quickly moved from her position, onto another tree. She knew from her training that if she was going to support the group as a marksman, she couldn't afford to stay in one place for too long, otherwise they would find her.

On top of that, from the initial five that were joining in the fight, more people in the distance could be seen creeping through the jungle. For now, she would do whatever she could to injure them as much as possible.

'I can do this!'

The three that managed to get through, all ran forward at once, and one of them had gone straight for Nate. The masked man had its hand clawed and wrapped in blood aura, something Nate hadn't seen before, nor did he know it was something they could do.

"Too slow!" Nate shouted, at the right time he stepped forward using a flash step to avoid the strike, and with a fist punched the masked person directly in the face, continuing the contact until the fist and his face were touching the ground beneath them.

The other vampires soon came to attack him from either side, but he had Blood hardening on his arms, and managed to stop the attacks. However, they were faster than Nate had anticipated. He was hoping to get rid of two of them, so he could pick off one of them on their own, but now he was forced to block their attacks.

"You guys should be ashamed." Nate smiled, as he continued to block hit after hit from the vampires. "You've been vampires from the beginning, right? That means you must have lived far longer than me. You had all this time to train your skills, yet this is as far as you got!"

At the right time, when one of the foes was ready to attack again, a shadow appeared in front of him stopping his attack, meaning Nate was able to freely go after the other vampire. Quickly, moving his head he avoided a punch and grabbed the masked man by the back of the head, before pulling the head down and slamming it into his knee.

Before they could recover, Nate made sure to use a strike he had been practising from someone he had seen so many times before. Throwing out a fist, with a Blood spray, Nate slammed a Blood hammer into the vampire's stomach, making sure he would never get up again.

Turning around, Nate placed his shadow down expecting to have to deal with one more, but to his surprise he saw Sam there as well, and the other vampire already finished off on the ground.

"If their backs are turned and distracted, I can do something on my own." Sam stated. "You don't have to look after me that much. Besides there's something I realised, something that these guys don't have compared to the vampires inside the vampire settlement. It might just have been the ones we have fought so far, but I have a feeling it will be true for all of them."

"What do you mean?" Nate asked.

"None of them have any of the vampire abilities that we've witnessed over there. They're just using their blood powers." Sam answered, still unsure what the reason for that was. Still, they only had a moment to catch their breath for there were more they needed to deal with.

——

Inside the castle, both Raten and Vorden had moved rooms after the roots had come down to attack them. They ended up choosing one of the many regular rooms, one that would have been used by the maids.

Just like before, Borden was guarding both of them, yet this time they were in an even worse state. Previously they had been consuming crystals one by one, this way after each crystal was absorbed they could still choose to fight if there was a need, albeit it weakened.

However, after the attack they had experienced, they started to experiment with consuming many crystals. They both found that although the time to absorb the crystals was longer when consuming more than one. It was shorter than if they were to do so separately, one by one.

Which was why, they both had decided to consume all of the crystals and were in the next step. How long it would take them to get out of it, and whether they would evolve or not, they didn't know and neither did Borden.

While watching over the two of them, Borden heard the castle shaking from below. It was clear that something had hit the castle and he was wondering what it could have been. He looked at the two of them.

'No one will suspect that someone is in this room, right?' Borden tried to convince himself… but he quickly changed his mind. 'No, I have to stay in place! I can't disappoint them again!'

Choosing to stay, Borden believed he was doing the right thing. He reasoned that it might just have been a stray attack from somewhere that had hit the castle, or maybe something else. After waiting a while, several bangs could be heard throughout the castle, and each time they were getting louder and louder.

'What is going on? This can't all just be coincidence. If something is in the castle, I have to make sure it won't disturb these two.' Borden thought.

The banging and crashing was still heard, and as Borden made his way through the castle to try and locate where the noise was coming from it was getting louder and louder. Eventually Borden realized that the sound was coming from the dining room.

Still in his large, adult sized form, Borden decided to form his spikes on his back before entering, listening to his Dalki self. Now ready to fight, Borden opened the doors confidently.

As for what he could see was in the castle, it was a huge surprise to him.

There were three figures in the room that were breaking and trashing everything they could see in the castle. They destroyed every room they had entered, but what was most surprising about them was that they were Dalki.

"That one, is the one that attacked Slicer!" One of them pointed at Borden.

Borden knew he couldn't hold back, because all three of them were three spiked Dalki.

# Chapter 1283 - Don't Turn
Quinn only had a short amount of time to test the capabilities of the Roseus tree beforehand, but now, forced into this real battle situation, he was quickly picking up new tricks and skills that were helping out with the fight against their enemy.

For example, while using Full Control on the Demon tier tree itself, he could still continue to give it simple commands as if he was giving someone partial control orders. What this meant was that the Vampire Lord could focus on certain parts on the island to help boost creatures and fight against the enemy.

The masked vampires were getting frustrated as more and more beasts had been coming out of nowhere, since the tree's roots had been marking new one whenever one died off.

Another difference between the tree and the Demon tier amulet was in regards to the energy transfer. The tree actually never seemed to run out of energy, it seemed more like it was allowing the beasts to borrow its energy.

At first, whenever one beast was close to death, Quinn would drain their energy, but before discovering the ability to delegate some tasks to the tree, he had been unable to drain every creature before its demise.

However, this did lead him to the realisation that whenever one of the Marked beasts died, the energy inside them would automatically return to the Roseus tree. Essentially, the beasts that did remain were able to grow stronger as Quinn continued to give them energy. .

'No wonder the original Demon tier Tree had been so difficult to deal with. I've been wondering how Robin got so strong, even after it had Marked all the others.' Quinn thought to himself.

Surprisingly, while checking around the island, Quinn discovered one of his fellow comrades who seemed to be on his own… only there were actually two tagalongs behind him.

"Damn it!" Peter shouted. "I thought I could get a head start and head to where all those ships were to deal with them before they came to the island, but now I have no clue where I'm going. I'm lost!"

However, even if Peter was lost he still managed to run into his fair share of opponents as well, the only problem was…

Six masked men had been running through the jungle, they had easily spotted a large pale body from a mile away and had designated him as a target. All of them chose to attack, throwing out their blood swipes through the trees.

They thought their attack was sure to hit, but the pale body avoided all of the strikes. Seeing this, the masked men thought it would be best if they attacked head on instead. Using their physical strength and vampire powers, they charged in.

That's when they noticed Peter as well next to the pale body, he had a strange smile on his face as if he was excited. Peter crashed his knuckles and cracked his neck turning it side to side.

'Finally six of them, maybe these guys will be a m-' Before Peter could finish his thought, he heard something similar to the sound of a whip. The masked men didn't quite register what had even happened, as they carried on moving forward, soon finding their upper bodies sliding off from their legs, and eventually falling to the ground…

"Damn it!" Peter shouted. "Legs you keep killing them all before I even get to hit them! I know you're just trying to protect me, but I want to have a little bit of fun as well, you know?!"

Quinn couldn't believe what he had just witnessed. Slicer's legs with the tail were still just as strong as before. Not even vampires could match up to it, and Hilston's body was also faster than they could react.

Seeing this, Quinn thought that maybe Peter really wasn't someone he had to worry about, and decided he could leave him be to do his own thing, while he continued trying to slow down the Masked.

———

Inside the castle, Borden had just entered the dining room, only to discover a trio of three spiked Dalki already inside.

'It looks like they recognise me from that video. Should I feel flattered that Dalki watched it as well?' Borden thought, as he was about to turn away. 'There goes my plan to pretend to be one of them. Not that I was going to do that for long anyway.'

Currently, Borden was a three spiked Dalki, just like the ones in front of him. At the time he hadn't noticed it, but during the fight against Slicer he had been so filled with anger, seeing his brother in trouble he had managed to summon a fourth… Unfortunately he was unable to do the same at this moment.

He didn't understand why he was different from other Dalki. He could take on a human form while others couldn't, just like he could hide the number of spikes on his back, but it didn't matter, he was different.

Still, when his body was about to turn around, he heard a voice in his head speak to him.

'Are you going to just run away?'

The voice was clearly his own, yet somehow just the mere idea of running away annoyed him.

'No.' Borden decided as he turned back around, just in time to see an incoming punch from one of the Dalki. Moving his head he avoided it, only to counter with a punch of his own, delivering a devastating uppercut to the Dalki's chin, sending it up in the air.

'I can't run away, because I am going to protect them! I'll kill these guys!' Borden let out a scream.

He was able to hit the first one, hoping it would be enough to kill the resilient Dalki, whose resilience rivaled zombies at times. Borden moved forward hoping to finish off the Dalki, but two more fists came towards him.

Borden lifted his arms up blocking the attack. He could tell that although they were all three spikes, their strength was not on par with his, as he was only forced back a few inches from where he had stood. Still, there was a crucial problem, there were three of them and one of him.

Before he could do anything else, the fist from the second Dalki connected with his stomach, causing him to drop to his, then the third Dalki used his foot to kick him in the head

The first one had also recovered and jumped up to join his companions as Borden gritted his teeth. When it was close enough, Borden surprised them all, by lunging at the first one, both of them landing on the floor. Only to receive two more hits from the others, now damaging the scales on his body.

This continued, for every hit Borden was able to get in, he would be hit two times back himself. At the same time, even though he was getting stronger with each hit, so was one of them.

'I have to do something, otherwise I won't last long against three of them. Unless I manage to get to my fourth spike like back then, I'll lose this fight!'

His worries started to distract Borden, and the Dalki who had realised that their opponent intended to turn this into a slugfest were smart enough to all start aiming at the same location, the side of his ribs. One of them had even decided to claw at it, rather than make a fist, ripping some of Borden's scales off.

Green blood was now spilling from his side, and he was pretty sure his ribs were broken.

"Arghhh!" Borden screamed, ignoring it, and charging in again, he latched onto the Dalki that was injured the most. This whole time Borden was aiming for something, he had purposely decided not to hurt the other two as much, and whenever he got the chance to attack the first one, he had used his full strength, judging now was the time.

Leaving the others alone had been to to weaken their powers, and hurting this one was to put him on the edge. Borden, then lifted the Dalki into the air, and over his shoulder, planning to slam it into the ground, but he could see two fists coming his way.

'They're going to hit me right after I beat this one… and it's going to hurt.' Borden thought but continued with his attack anyway.

Slamming the Dalki down, it had made a whole in the floor cracking the ground beneath them. They were on the bottom floor but what they didn't realise was that there was a whole cave system underneath.

Now the Dalki had been lost.

'Wait, why aren't I getting hurt?' Borden thought, as he had expected to get hit by the other two any second now, but it had never come. Looking around the room, he saw a large black furred creature with giant black wings on his back, and a snout-like face with devastating fangs.

On his forearms, there were also what looked like smaller wings, only folded giving them a strong and sharp look. In front of him on the ground was Dalki that was blooded, while another had been hit away into the wall.

"Vorden… you evolved?" Borden asked in amazement.

"Yeah, but I'm not the only one." Vorden replied with a smirk.

# Chapter 1284 - A New Tier
His appearance had changed once again through evolution, but Borden was unsure whether Vorden was now inhabiting the body of a humanoid beast who had evolved into a Demi-god tier beast or whether the crystals they had gathered had been enough to allow Tails to reach the Demon tier level.

Borden looked over at the two struggling Dalki to get an idea just how powerful Vorden had grown. The Dalki that was now covered in green blood, was standing up and the other that had been blasted through the wall was also returning. Thankfully it seemed like the one Borden had thrown through the floor wasn't getting back up, which hopefully meant that it was dead.

"Ah, I guess I'm still not strong enough to take out a three spiked Dalki in one hit, these guys are super tough." Vorden stated calmly, his wings on his back started to move slightly, getting ready to be used. Jumping back, it looked like Vorden's body was floating for a few seconds as he landed gently by Borden's side.

"Even as a Demi-god tier beast it won't be easy for me to match up against this trio of three spikes. Borden, I'm going to need your help on this one." Vorden requested. Fortunately, their opponents were on the weaker end among three spikes, so as long as Borden teamed up with his brother, the two of them felt confident in taking them. .

"What about Raten?" Borden asked. "Is he still going through the evolution process?"

With the two Dalki getting closer, Vorden was getting ready to attack, opting to answer Borden's question later, but it was at that moment that a smile appeared on his face, as he realised there would be no need for him to do anything.

"Just see for yourself."

The two Dalki were a little shocked by the sudden entrance of a beast. However, on their way towards the castle, they had run into many beasts that had attacked them, so they assumed this one would be no different.

Nevertheless, they remained cautious because this was the first beast that had managed to draw blood on their hard scaled bodies, because of this all of their attention was focused on the Dalki and beast in front of them, that they had failed to notice that both of them could no longer move.

When they attempted to move their feet, they suddenly felt stuck. Looking down, both of them could see that their feet had been encased in some type of mud.

"What is this?! Why can't we move?!" One of them shouted in anger, but with no momentum and just their power alone they were unable to break through the substance that had appeared below them. This was a first for the two Dalki who used their strength to break through everything.

'Just how strong is that stuff if it can stop even three spiked Dalki from moving and where did it come from?' Borden wondered, as he hadn't been paying much attention either. The next second, a human figure could be seen dropping from above, and at the same time, two large blades were being formed in seconds.

A liquid mud-like substance could be seen changing shape and forming into the two blades at the last second, until it had pierced right through the top of both the Dalki's heads, like two meat skewers, both of them were no longer moving.

Now standing, in the middle of the two Dalki, was the mud-like beast.

"Raten, you killed them so easily! But how is that possible… unless you're a…" Borden wasn't too sure about the evolution, since Muddy's appearance hadn't changed as drastically as Tails.

"Hahaha…hahaha…this is GREAT!" Raten loud enough that he risked attracting any nearby Dalki, and that was because he didn't care about this possibility. In fact, he was so confident in this new body that he would welcome any to come over to him.

"Yeah, your guess is right." Vorden replied. "Muddy managed to evolve, which means right now Raten is controlling the body of a humanoid Demon tier beast. I was worried that even after hunting that many high tier beasts we would lack in crystals, but fortunately Muddy had done a good job on his own."

"We were also lucky that Tails' body needed far less crystal than we had estimated. Since it seemed impossible for me to evolve into a Demon tier, I handed my remaining share over to Raten." Vorden started to explain.

"After we finished our evolution, we noticed that there were Dalki in the castle. The first one actually entered our room and Raten dealt with it before I could even help. We then split up, he eliminated other Dalki we could hear, and I came to you, since I was worried."

"According to Muddy, even though his form hasn't changed too much, he now can use a number of different skills he couldn't do before. His body can form into a type of soft mud, but when it's hardened it's just as strong as the weapons or shield he made before. He can even change his whole body into a mud like substance, even his real form and can practically transform into whatever shape he wants right now."

"If he wanted to go under doors as just a pile of mud he can, whereas before he could only transform part of his mud and was limited to his human-like appearance."

Although it didn't sound too impressive, Borden, who had been fighting the three spiked Dalki, had just seen it in action. The Mud Hardening was able to even restrain their strength, making it extremely useful.

It was then, that the mud surrounding the Dalkis' legs had joined up with Ratan's body that Borden could see a slight change, the sheer size of Raten was now bulkier, but he soon disperse the mud making small little daggers by his side, and started to mold the mud more and more, putting detail into every little indent in his body, until finally something had happened that not even Vorden had seen coming.

Both of them were completely shocked by the change.

"Y-you now look completely like a…H-human." Vorden stuttered, still in disbelief and honestly a little jealous.

Before, Raten with the beast body just had a human-like figure, but one could still see that it was just a beast. Now there was so much detail in his appearance. Were it not for the strange colour, as well as some missing parts of the human body like lips, Raten could be mistaken for a human. He had even molded himself a pair of eyebrows.

After finishing looking at Raten in awe, the three of them knew they needed to do something. They were sure that things must have gone horribly wrong on the outside if the Dalki had managed to infiltrate the castle. They were still lacking the whole picture due to staying inside the whole time.

Borden was quite hurt, and Vorden had offered him an injection, but taking one meant that his body would fully heal, and he would lose access to all the strength his injured body granted him.

"I think it might be best if we save that for later. I can still fight, and we don't know who else is inside this castle." Borden rejected his offer.

Before leaving the place, the three Blades decided to scout the whole area to see if there was anyone else inside. It was then that they had found their first vampires that tried to attack them, but dealing with the vampires was a lot easier than the Dalki.

Going up through the floors they were encountering more, and eventually they had stumbled upon a whole group of masked men who used the red aura powers of the vampire, while another had used an earth ability.

Vorden found this strange as it was the first ability user they had come across. Vorden wanted to test a few things out, for he didn't seem to have super strength or speed like the others either, but Raten had killed the masked man before they could ask him anything.

'Dalki, Vampires and now even Humans, all of them are working together to take over this island? Just who is our enemy to be able to gather these three different groups under one banner?' Vorden wondered.

After clearing out the castle, not finding out much in regards to why those people had come here, they decided to head outside, where they could hear the fighting taking place all over.

"We should go to Sam and see if he needs our help with anything?" Vorden suggested.

"Sure, but do you happen to have ANY idea where Sam currently is?" Raten replied sarcastically since none of them had a way to contact the vampire.

In the middle of their small argument, they could feel the ground underneath them shake, followed by a loud roaring not too far from them.

"This has to be the Demon tier beast." Borden pointed out. "But why does it sound so…angry?"

Both Raten and Vorden looked at each other. Although both of them were inside the body of a humanoid beast, to them it had just sounded like a beast's roar, so they were wondering how Borden could tell how it was feeling.

However, Vorden considered that Borden wasn't quite like them. He wasn't just half beast, but created using one half of the Demon tier beast that was on this island, so perhaps he shared some connection to it, at least enough to be able to pick up on its emotions.

"If it's angry, maybe we should go see why." Vorden suggested.

# Chapter 1285 - Moody Dragon
Brock, Eno and Vincent were standing mere meters away from the Demon tier beast that looked like a Dragon. Initially, they had been unsure if it was going to attack them or leave them be, as it had just continued staring at them, but once it had let out that almighty roar, they all understood that none of them were welcome anymore.

When Quinn had gone up to the tablet, Vincent was unable to hear the voice on the other side, but he could hear what Quinn was saying. It sounded one sided but he could guess the words that were being spoken and Quinn often updated him on what was happening as he wanted a second opinion.

However, for the first time, Vincent had heard the voice, and knowing that it didn't come from the other two with him, he was certain that it had come from the tablet itself, meaning it had come from the one that Quinn had called Ray.

'Could it be that I can hear the voice because I'm in Quinn's body?' Vincent theorised, however, looking at the two in front, it was clear from their confused looks that they too had heard it. .

Noticing this, he looked past the Dragon to see that the tablet had lit up, just as it had done when Quinn would speak to it, even though at the moment no one was touching it.

"Please… get out of here!" The voice insisted once more but it started to fade away, and so did the light of the tablet, indicating that it could no longer help.

Just when the tablet's light had faded the Dragon started to charge towards the three of them. With its mighty legs, each step caused the ground to rumble. The beast opened its maw wide, revealing the orange light at the back of its throat.

'We have to get out of here. That Ray guy wouldn't warn us if this wasn't serious. Right now, none of us are a match for it. Perhaps even the enemy has underestimated the strength of the Demon tier beast!' Vincent thought, as he went to grab onto the one closest to him, Brock.

The fire was ready to leave the beast's mouth and Eno was a few fingertips away. Seeing this, Vincent had no choice, but to use Quinn's shadow to travel, placing both him and Brock in the shadow underneath to move away, yet the ancient vampire stood there unafraid.

When the flames were about to touch him, the middle spire of his crown started to light up, and soon the rest of his armour did so as well. The fire crashed into Eno yet somehow none of it touched him. The flames spread as if they were hitting some type of wall, and when looking at Eno, ripples of red aura could be seen in the air contumely moving.

"There was no need for you to do that." Brock stated without looking at his 'rescuer' his gaze fixed at Eno who was blocking the attack.

"Excuse me for wanting to help you… how was I supposed to know his blood armour could do that?" Vincent replied. Blood armour wasn't exactly common, in fact it was rare enough to see someone so much as wear it. From his limited experience, he was sure that the set of armour should have great defence, so he had considered the possibility of Eno surviving the attack, yet he had never thought about it being able to create something like a force field.

"Granted, you couldn't have known. The Vampire King's set, Arthur's set, every blood armour set has a different skill, just like some blood weapons." Brock nodded.

Vincent was thinking back to the fight with Cindy. How the blood armour had been powered by not just human blood but vampire blood as well. To this day, Vincent still wasn't sure what the king's blood armour did, other than radiating a part of the armour, and a strong force being exerted from that area.

However, he was sure of one thing, that each of the blood armours required blood for their ability to activate, yet Vincent could see none.

"As long as we stay behind Richard, we are safe." Brock repeated.

Noticing that its flames didn't have the intended effect, the Dragon stopped, but the trail of flames continued, so Eno continued to stand there waiting for the attack to end. The Demon tier beast turned around, swinging his gigantic tail at a speed that even a vampire would struggle to keep up with, much less the ancient vampire who was rooted in place,

It went through its own flames like it was nothing, the tail was also coming from the side rather than head on. Seeing this, Brock's facade changed for the first time to a look of worry.

'Is he limited to blocking only attacks from the front or is it because he is still blocking the flames?' Vincent wondered seeing this.

The next second, the giant tail slammed into Eno and his armour, sending him flying. A blur was seen passing through the jungle, and the sound of several trees were heard breaking as he crashed through them one by one.

It appeared that Eno, who always seemed to have some type of trump card up his sleeve or some secret backup plan, came up short for once. In fact, Vincent wouldn't be surprised if he might even be out of this fight altogether.

"It looks like it might have been a good thing that me and you were in this shadow, after all." Vincent cockily noted.

"We have to check if the master Is okay, let me out of this place!" Brock demanded, not in the mood for any jabs.

"Hold on." Vincent held him back. Now wasn't the time to lose their temper, not when there was still a giant and angry Demon tier beast in their immediate vicinity.

The two of them had traveled out of the open area, and were looking at everything that was going on from the outskirts of the jungle. The Dragon hadn't done much, it had only breathed a single breath of fire and swung its tail, and not even Eno could face something like that with his blood amour. It was clear that the two of them stood no chance.

'Perhaps by using the shadow powers, I could block one attack. Wait, isn't Quinn's Shadow overload skill the answer? With the soul weapon active it gives him an unlimited amount of MC cells, as long as he can move the shadow fast enough he could block any attack?'

Still, that wouldn't help them defeat the Dragon, they would still be lacking in the fire power department, not to mention their primary goal was to defend the beast, not to defeat it.

"Alright, it seems the Dragon has gone back to its usual spot by the tablet. It's no longer sleeping like it was before, but I think as long as we stay out of its way, things will be fine. It seems to attack anyone that gets too close to it." Vincent noted.

Brock found Vincent's conjecture convincing, but right now he couldn't care less about that overgrown lizard, he just wanted to hurry up and check whether Eno was okay. Since they didn't have to fear the wrath of the beast any longer, Vincent let go of him.

"I'll stay by the Dragon's side. Just go and see if the old man is okay. Well, I guess we're all old timers, huh." Vincent chuckled to himself, as the two of them left the shadow to travel and were back in the jungle, not too far from the open area.

"Just don't get too close to that Dragon on your way back!" Vincent stressed.

Brock nodded and was already running off into the direction Eno had been sent to. It was easy enough to follow him, given the line of destruction he had left.

Meanwhile, Vincent remained, waiting to see just how the enemy was planning to capture such a wild beast.

———

All blood armour that had been created was strong beyond belief. Even Quinn had been unable to put so much as a dent in the blood armour while Cindy had been wearing it. He had only managed to damage her body through it, and this was exactly how Eno felt right now.

To his luck, he had been hit into a cave behind a waterfall, but on his way he had crashed into several trees, eventually recovering mid air he had stopped himself before hitting any of the walls in the cave he was in.

'I knew it would have been better to stick to my original plan of moving the Demon tier beast. If those brats had only listened to me, we could have simply focused on fighting the enemy in front of us. Now we have to worry about the Demon tier beast as well. I hate it when I'm stressed out.' Eno thought standing up letting the blood flow out of his mouth, but he soon made a circle motion with his finger, opening up a small portal that looked similar to the ones the ships had come from.

Putting his hand inside, he pulled out a flask, and started to chug down on the blood inside.

Surprised, Eno could hear sounds beyond the wall of water that was crashing down in front of him. Eno decided to walk towards the cave entrance that was covered by the wall of water falling from above and eventually jumped through it landing on a large rock around the edge of the river.

There he could see a certain person, calmly walking through the jungle, with two large Dalki by his side.

"JIM!!!!" Eno shouted out.

*****

# Chapter 1286 - The Back Up
There was one more member of the Cursed faction that had arrived with the group, but hadn't been part of any of the plans so far, nor had Eno given him any direction. This was because the moment he had arrived, rather than to go through the hidden stash of beast gear Hilston Blade had accumulated, he had been told to do something else.

While the others had been gleefully searching for treasure, Logan had headed for Blade Island's so-called Temple. It was a place where the Blade kids had been forced to learn how to fight and use their abilities. As for the reason why Logan was here, it was all because Sam had given him a special mission, a task that only he could do.

'Sam's intellect might not be as vast as mine, but his foresight sure is impressive. Then again, sending me here was also the obvious choice.' Logan thought, as he was walking through one of the hallways, searching for the best location to start on his little project. 'Just like Richard Eno himself, it never hurts to have a back up plan, especially since that man can't be trusted.'

The Temple was a large building that was shaped like a square. The centre of it was an open field, which the Blade kids had used to practise. The other parts of the large square were used as classrooms, filled with all sorts of resources…

'This classroom should do.' Logan decided, as he entered one. He placed a circular disk on the floor which had a red light in the centre that lit up. Once he was done there, Logan also went to the roof of the building, and started to set something else up.

While he himself was busy with the tools he had brought along, he had made sure to instruct his spiders to be on the lookout throughout the jungle. The Temple was considered a relatively safe area, away from beasts, but the journey was not.

However, thanks to Logan's little spiders he had been able to avoid any trouble, especially since the Blade siblings had done a good job culling their numbers. The few times he had ended up running into a beast though, Logan had easily been able to fight it off, or just outright kill it.

"That's the fourth one done, now it should be covered by all sides, and I already finished setting up the jammers around the place as well."

Standing up, Logan looked over his work, now there was only one more thing that needed to be done. Grabbing a crystal from the large backpack that was carried by what looked like strange robotic spider legs, Logan placed the crystal in the device.

Fueled by an energy source, it went online and immediately started moving. The device itself looked like a robotic turret, and started to move from left to right. At the moment, they were set to auto mode, but Logan could also control all of them by using a special pair of glasses that he had brought with him. They were also connected to his special suits.

On all sides of the rectangle building, Logan had set up these special turrets that would fire off energy blasts using the power of crystals. Their range wasn't too far, but that was because he didn't want anyone to know he was here in the first place.

Before setting up the turrets, Logan had picked out certain areas to set up the special teleporter jammers. There were two ways to jam the Dalki technology. One was to have it built into the teleporter device. This had been the case with the teleporter next to the tablet.

It was designed this way so the Dalki wouldn't get suspicious and it was easy to protect just one item. As for the second way, that was what Logan had used inside the Temple. They looked similar to the Dalki jammers only that they did the opposite, blocking out the Dalki's teleporter jammers within a certain area.

Setting these up in hiding spots, now the whole Temple was safe from any type of jammer, even if a couple of them were to be destroyed.

Heading back inside Logan headed to another room. This one was smaller than the others and it only had two desks inside, making him slightly curious what exactly it had been used for. Whatever it was, for some reason it had been the one kept in the best shape.

To his right, he could see plenty of books on the shelves as well as anime stories about superheroes.

Before starting his work, he heard a loud roar off in the distance, even from where he was.

"This is the perfect place to set up the teleporter, and it looks like we might need it." Logan mumbled as he got to work.

The special task he had been assigned was to prepare a second teleporter. However, it wasn't so others could come and help them. No, Sam had made it clear that he wanted Logan to make it work one-way. If more people started to appear from the Temple, the enemy might end up targeting that place.

If their task seemed impossible, this teleporter would act as a last resort to ensure they could retreat!

——

After leaving the castle, the Blades decided to head to where they had just heard the loud roar come from. They knew they were heading to the other Demon tier beast.

Perhaps it was overconfidence, but now that Muddy had evolved into a Demon tier beast as well, Raten was sure he could deal with it, if the need arose. His siblings showed no fear as they were heading towards it, which was probably the wrong choice.

Humanoid beasts were meant to be the strongest type of beasts in existence, and Raten was a Demon tier humanoid one. This was where some of Raten's logic had come from.

When seeing it up ahead, Raten charged forward hoping to get to the beast first before the others.

"Raten, wait!' Vorden shouted out. "We don't even know if the others are in trouble, the beast could even be helping us!"

It was clear to him that Raten just wanted to pick a fight with the beast to prove who was the stronger one of the Demon tier beasts. The good thing was, before Raten could leave the jungle, a shadow appeared in front of them, blocking his path. What's more a fist filled with red aura came out of it, aimed at Raten's stomach, sending him a few feet back.

"Calm down, you idiots, or you'll get us all to be killed!" They were being berated by Vincent.

The attack hadn't hurt Raten, not that Vincent had his full strength in the first place. Even if he had, Muddy's new body was strong enough that a punch without any Qi would hardly be noticed by him. The concept of that, was one of the few things that Vincent still hadn't grasped while in Quinn's body.

Blood powers were something he had known, and getting the hang out of the Shadow power had also been easy, but Qi was something foreign to him. Quinn's body might be able to use it, but Vincent hadn't yet figured out how.

"The Demon tier beast doesn't seem to attack us as long as we don't come too close to it. So it will be in our best interest to make sure none of us enter that open area around it. For now we should stay and keep watch." Vincent explained.

"Who are you?" Vorden asked suddenly. "I've known Quinn for a long time, but I've never heard him speak to us like strangers. Where is Quinn? What have you done to him?!" With Vorden asking these questions, the other two were getting ready for a fight.

———

Quinn was still using Full Control on the Roseus tree, but he could see that the beasts he was using were about to be overwhelmed. What's more from the looks of it, the roots had already marked all the beasts that had been on the island.

'How many of these masked people are there? It seems that I have exhausted all the beasts on the island, yet they just keep coming. The Cursed faction are doing a good job holding them off, but it seems like it's never ending.'

Noticing this, Quinn decided to give a final command to the Roseus tree. To supply beasts that were alive with as much energy as possible, and to also protect the Cursed faction members. The last ones it had marked shouldn't attack the enemy but focus on protecting the others.

'I guess it's time for me to return to my body and see what's happened.' Quinn decided.

*****

# Chapter 1287 - A Tiger's Last Stand
When Vorden had asked this question, he thought back to the time when they had all been in the Shelter. Back then, he had seen Quinn, but not once had his friend used his shadow abilities. Even if he had obtained it at some point, that didn't explain the strange way the 'Quinn' before them spoke to them.

Vorden had gathered that most likely the person that was in control of Quinn before at the Shelter, would be the same person now, but he was interested to find out just who this person was, and was hoping to get an answer. The only problem was, Vorden didn't account for the fact that he had two hot headed brothers who were ready for action.

Immediately after Vorden voiced his doubt about the person in front of them being the actual Cursed faction leader, they considered him to be an enemy.

The first thing Raten did was liquify parts of his body, sinking mud into the ground, using it to trap the person in front of them. They knew how fast and agile Quinn's body was, so if this wasn't a double, but someone who took control over him, it was in their best interest to chain him down. It worked perfectly, since Vincent didn't exactly want to fight against them.

"Hang on, what are you doing, I'm-" Before Vincent really had a chance to explain himself, Borden had already thrown out a punch. Fortunately the Vampire Lord's body allowed Vincent to see it coming from a mile away… He avoided and grabbed onto Broden's wrist.

"You know this body doesn't lack in strength when compared to you, and these things can't trap me." Vincent pointed out, as he sunk into his shadow travel in order to escape from the mud that he was trapped in. As soon as he reappeared, Vincent held out his hand ready to fire, as he could see the two beasts coming towards him.

'Dealing with them might prove difficult. It would be one thing if they were the enemy, but Quinn wouldn't be too happy if I end up hurting his friends!' Vincent was worried about what to do. Alas, they didn't seem like the types to listen, not unless he forced them to, after subduing them.

Luckily, just in that moment, a certain person returned to his own body.

Quinn was confused since the first thing he saw were two of his friends coming at him, and as they both were inches away from him, Quinn had disappeared, and the two had struck nothing but air. A few seconds later, and Quinn had reappeared after using his Shadow lock on himself and this time, he had all of the gear of the Blue Fang armour set.

"Have you guys been taken over? What's happened!" Quinn demanded an answer, ready to attack them both, currently under the same misconception as the two of them.

"Wait!" Vorden called, hoping to explain the situation.

——

Out of all the Cursed group members that had split up, there was one group struggling more so than any of the others, and that was Wevil and Linda. Both of them used to be the vice leaders of their old factions at one point and having to fight multiple enemies wasn't something uncommon to them at this point, still the sheer number of their opponents was proving too much.

Wevil could no longer keep up his Tiger Beetle from running out of energy. He had great speed but as he tired, the countless masked vampires that had only been a little slower than himself had finally managed to catch up to him.

'I need blood.' Wevil thought as he huffed and puffed. Soon two masked men were on him with their claws out. Wevil hurried to defend himself with his daggers, stabbing one in the thigh and the other at the back of his neck.

Seconds later, he was hit by a red aura from another direction.

"Arghh!" Wevil screamed in pain as his body hurled over. The vampire who had been stabbed in the thigh saw his chance and went for the kill with a swipe of his hand, only to be stopped seconds later by a giant club that knocked him away.

"Wevil, I'll cover for you!" Linda shouted, but she didn't look much better than her companion, covered in blood, much of it her own. Looking at her, Wevil could tell her wounds were no longer healing the same as before and both of them were suffering from the same problem.

They both needed energy. Wevil could obtain new energy from blood, he just needed to touch a human, while Linda needed to consume humans similar to how Peter did. In the middle of the chaos it was impossible for them to recharge.

The Masked attackers just didn't seem to stop coming. At first they had been easily able to deal with the groups of five that would appear through the forest, but now more and more were getting through, while they were starting to feel exhausted.

'Crap, I just need to find a human, isn't there a single one amongst all those!' Wevil looked around. That was when he spotted someone at the very back. It was still a masked figure, hiding between some trees.

'Why are they staying so far away, are they waiting for us to get weak?' Wevil worried that there was a reason for that person's behaviour and it couldn't be good. He picked himself up, but as quickly as he did, his legs felt like jelly causing him to almost fall to the ground again. The next second he could see a giant shadow cast over him.

He looked up and could see Linda's face in front of him.

'Is she covering me?' Wevil thought.

"I need to tell you something." Linda said, as she grunted. Wevil was wondering what was going on but he was unable to see outside due to Linda's large body. In her Great Draugr form she was almost gigantic, larger than a Dalki.

But he could tell that what was most likely happening was that more enemies had come and they were attacking her right now, and she was the one who was protecting him.

"I forgive you Wevil… I blamed you… our faction for my brother's death for so long. The truth was I got close to you because I was planning to get some sort of revenge on the members of the Parasites, but as I got to know you, I discovered that you weren't as bad a person as I believed. That just started to make things so much harder, and I don't know when, but eventually…I …I fell in love with you." Linda spoke, tears running down her face but due to the hunched position she was in the tears rolled down her eyebrows and onto the ground.

"Linda what are you doing, get up! Get up!" Wevil screamed, unable to appreciate the giant woman's confession. He didn't care for what Linda was saying, all he wanted to do was for the two of them to survive this mess right now. The attacks could be heard clearer now, from the outside. Although she had a good set of armour, they both saw that she was close to her limit.

"Linda, you can't die! You can't die for me. We have to fight! Even if you protect me like this, they'll just kill me afterward! Get up, we have to fight! Don't you remember what Quinn said? This is not worth risking our lives for! Are you going to disobey his order!' Wevil screamed at the top of his lungs.

"I'm sorry… it's too late." Linda sniffled. "I can't even move my body."

"Then…I'll move you!" Wevil shouted, the strength that was gone from his body was slowly returning. He was experiencing some type of second wind as he stood up, and went forward. He started to use all his strength pushing Linda's gigantic body up.

He pushed with all his power, his muscles bulging.

'I don't know how long I can stay like this for, but…I have to make sure that at least Linda survives!' Wevil thought as he screamed to further hype himself up, forcing his arms to slightly transform into that of the Tiger Beetle. Changing his legs as well, he pushed off the ground springing him up, and Linda's body was lifted off and landed onto the side.

He now could see the blue sky again, and turned to look at Linda, seeing what might have happened to her, or if she needed help. She was now lying on her front, her body was shrinking back down to her regular human size, but the armour hadn't changed for she was too weak to even use her shadow abilities, but at least her eyes didn't look as if she had died.

Wevil looking at where he was could see a pool of blood, it wasn't his own, but it all belonged to Linda. She had given it her all to protect him.

"You Bastards!!" Wevil screamed.

Linda had her hand held out…softly saying the words… "Run…"

For right now, Wevil was surrounded by around a dozen masked men. Ironically, he noticed that the one who had been staying at the back this whole time had also moved forward.

"Haha, now you come out!" Wevil could tell now that the guy was so close. He could sense that this person was human. He was exactly what both him and Linda needed to fight a little longer.

Using whatever he had left, Wevil somehow managed to move his legs. His body transformation had reverted after lifting Linda off himself. His daggers were on the ground, so charging forward he could do nothing but throw a fist, and at the same time, all the others charged in to intercept him.

Wevil's hand managed to make contact with something solid, but it wasn't the person in front of him. He felt like he had a wall.

"I thought you were just a regular human, but you bastard actually had an ability, huh." Wevil mumbled, accepting his fate. He was out of energy, unable to resist as the masked men were tearing into his body.

Their hands pierced through his stomach, into his chest, into his thigh, blood pouring from Wevil's mouth. As much as he wanted to turn around, to see Linda for a final time, he didn't have the strength for it.

'Thank you, Quinn… the time… with you… all… was… enjoy… a…b-'

# Chapter 1288 - The Special Box
Linda was unable to do anything to help Wevil. She laid there looking at the end of the person she had once hated, but who she had ended up falling in love with. Last time, she had been unable to help her brother Blip, blaming herself for him having lost his life.

Nothing seemed to have changed. Despite all the power she was supposed to have at her disposal, there she was failing to save a loved one once again.

She wanted to stretch out her arm towards Wevil, yet the only degree of movement she had in her was a slight twitch of her fingers. With the many wounds he had suffered it seemed impossible for him to have survived and the masked men weren't stopping, like ravenous beasts who had found food for the first time in weeks. Even though he was standing it seemed like it was only because of the others who were holding him up with their attacks.

Just as they had removed their hands from his body, Wevil's body flopped to the ground, showing no indication of life inside it.

'No! No!' Linda screamed in her head again. She was hoping to summon some type of surge in energy, similar to how little Wevil had been able to lift her gigantic body… If she had been able to stay on top of him then perhaps he would have been the one to have survived.

Yet here she was still unable to move, her MC cells had been spent, so she could do nothing. After dealing with Wevil, the masked men started to come towards her, and through the jungle more men were starting to appear.

'Quinn, where are you… weren't you meant to protect us? I thought you could feel it… Is that why you haven't come yet? Could it be Wevil isn't…he isn't…dead.' Despite considering that possibility, deep down she knew that shouldn't be the case. As resilient as vampires and their subclasses might be, even Peter was unlikely to survive this degree of damage.

"Where the hell are you, Quinn?! You should be here!!" Linda screamed at the top of lungs while squinting her eyes shut. She had used her last breath and no longer knew what was happening anymore, as she closed her eyes, part of her looking forward to reuniting with Wevil.

However, after a while she could hear the sound of fighting.

'What is going on?' She thought.

Her energy was still weak so it was hard for her to open them, and eventually the fighting that she could hear had stopped nearly just as quickly as it had started.

'I guess I must have passed out for a few seconds…whoever they were fighting stopped.'

"Here, eat this! It should help you regain some of your strength." A voice ordered her. She was too weak to recognise it. The owner of the voice seemed to have noticed that Linda was too weak. The next moment she felt something pressed against her lips, and before she processed what her own body was doing, she realised she had already started eating whatever it was in front of her.

Energy started to gather inside her body, and her wounds began to heal once again. Finally, she had enough strength to open her eyes, and that's when she could see it. Around twenty masked men had been slaughtered, their limbs removed from their body. One in particular looked like they had been cut.

When looking down, Linda noticed she had nothing but a human bone from an arm in her hand.

"Flesh, but how, weren't they all vampires?" Linda questioned.

"Not all." The person next to her replied. Turning her head she soon could see a large black furred beast. "Vorden!"

"Calm down, even though you have eaten enough to recover your energy, it will still take some time for your body to heal. It looks like you really did push yourself beyond what you were cable off. Honestly, I don't think you can fight anymore, even if you ate more." Vorden spoke to her, although he wasn't entirely sure if that was true since he wasn't a Vampire himself. He was mostly basing his knowledge on what he knew about Peter.

"There's not just vampires among their group, there are also humans. Although rare, they're dangerous since they can use abilities. Oh, and they're also Dalki on the island."

Linda looked shocked to hear this, and she realised now where the arm she had gotten must have come from.

"Wait, if you were able to get to me in time, does that mean!'' Linda sprung up, to look in the direction of where she last saw Wevil. However, Vorden quickly blocked her view, shaking his head.

In the few seconds she had managed to look over there, she couldn't see Wevil's body, but judging by the way Vorden was reacting, it was clear that he hadn't survived.

Almost immediately, Linda started to feel weak again, and she lent up placing her head into Vorden's chest.

"He didn't deserve to die! Why him? Why?! Vorden, tell me! Why are we the only ones fighting on this damn island! Why are we the ones losing people all the time! And where is…where is…"

"Quinn?" Vorden finished her sentence for her not wanting her to speak or use up any more energy. "Quinn was actually the one who sent us here. He could tell that you guys were struggling but he had to attend to something else, and Linda this war…hasn't been good for any of us."

"How many lives have already been lost, and how many more will be lost… I'm afraid we'll need to strengthen our resolve. This might not be the only loss we suffer this war, however he won't be forgotten. Wevil fought with his life for us, for the Cursed faction, for the human race."

"We need to make sure that he gave his life for a reason. You in particular Linda. I haven't been back with the Cursed faction for long, but I could tell that Wevil was always looking out for you."

Linda fell down once again, falling to the ground, but unfortunately they didn't have the luxury of time to allow her to grieve. The enemy was still on the move through the jungle, and Vorden, knowing this, grabbed onto Linda, flying back.

"Wait!" Linda cried out. "What about Wevil's body, where is it?"

"Wevil's body is being returned to the castle at the moment. Remember how I said we? The one that killed all those masked wasn't me Linda, it was Raten. Borden will take his body back to the Castle. I would never allow someone who fought so hard like that to get trampled or used for other means."

"I think it's best if we return as well Linda, take a break and rest for now, leave them to us."

Hearing these words, Linda soon closed her eyes and her exhaustion made her enter a deep sleep. Despite how fast Vorden was moving, and her having eaten, it was as if her mind had shut down with everything she had been through.

While travelling back to the castle, seeing Wevil's body before it was taken away. Vorden felt his arms constantly tensing as his blood boiled with anger. He was starting to worry whether they could actually win this fight and if so… just how high would the cost be that they would have to pay?

Even with him and Raten having evolved, he couldn't help but wonder if it was worth it.

'Maybe the best thing to do is give up the fight for now. Otherwise, more of us will lose our lives in this, but can we even do that, how do we even get out of here?'

——

At this moment, there was another Cursed faction group that was doing well up to a certain point, but now they were struggling as well. In this group, there was Fex, and Dennis who too had used their powers far more than they thought and were beginning to tire out.

At the moment, there were three of them, standing back to back. As for the third person, or being with them. It was a white haired gorilla with four arms. One of the Marked beasts being controlled by Quinn, who had been a great help to them so far.

There were other beasts originally by their side but now they had all been killed apart from one.

The whole group were surrounded by a mixture of vampires and humans and the group had become incredibly large in number reaching over forty.

"Do you think this is where our grave will be?" Dennis asked. At first they had been faring well, having already defeated around the same number surrounding them now, but as soon as they got tired, it was almost as if they were relying on their other allies to come and help.

"Don't speak like that, Old man. I'm not dying here, I have far too many things I need to do!" Fex shouted as he took the box off from his back that he had been carrying around the whole time and slammed it on the ground. "It's time to put this to use!"

# Chapter 1289 - The Puppet Master
As a society based on strength, many vampires looked down on those who used tools to show off their strength. It was why many of them refused to use beast gear, even though some had voiced that this sentiment seemed contradictory since their ancestors used blood weapons.

However, certain vampires felt like this was still part of their strength since they were created from crystals that could only be obtained from vampires, rather than borrowing it from mere beasts.

However, despite this belief, neither the regular nor the vampires in a family would look down upon the members of the thirteenth family, who were considered to be a strong family. Nonetheless, their real strength stemmed from their ability, for which they needed a tool, one that only their top members possessed and that was something called a puppet.

Of course that had not always been the case. In fact, in the past they had been mocked because of it. One day, an argument had escalated to the point that the family leaders had been forced to get involved. Picking one of the many families that had publicly mocked the thirteenth family's ways, he had called for a duel to settle the matter once and for all.

The Vampire King himself had come to observe the fight, just like all the other family leaders. The thirteenth family leader had done something no one had expected… Using his strings he grabbed one of the Vampire knights from the very leader he was about to face.

At first the other leader had scoffed at the thirteen's actions, believing that the other had done so to make him hesitate, however he did no such thing. With his first attack, he made it clear that he would not be holding back, but what happened next was a tale that would be told within the thirteenth family for centuries.

Using his strings, the thirteenth leader proved to be so skillful in controlling the Vampire knight puppet that he managed to make his opponent yield. A Vampire knight of the same family being able to to beat his own leader was something unheard of. It was such a huge embarrassment for the family that the leader was forced to go into eternal slumber to save face.

From that day on, vampires stopped regarding a puppet as a type of tool, instead treating it as the real trump card of the thirteenth family and the proper way for how the string ability was meant to be used. Ever since, the higher members of the thirteenth family spent much of their time mastering that art, and that included Fex.

After slamming the coffin-like box that was on his back on the ground, the lid fell to the floor, and a human male could be seen inside.

"Alright, Agent 11, it's time to do your work!" Fex shouted, as he kicked the box down and quickly threw needles tied with his strings towards the man, and started to summon his blood weapon right after. Once it was in Fex's hands he wasted no time stabbing Agent 11 in the back.

"Ahhh! What the hell is going on!" Agent 11 cried out, after seeing the outside light for the first time in a long while. He had only been able to hear noises from inside the box, so he was confused about what was going on. His freedom was short-lived, as he got stabbed by Fex, finding himself surrounded by blood thirsty killers on all sides.

"Look, you want to live, right?! Well if I die, you die. As you can see, those aren't your Pure buddies who have come to save you. Use your Qi or whatever else you have in store with your sword, and just let me do the rest!" Fex ordered.

The one that Fex was using as his puppet right now, was the Pure agent they had captured. Fex had never been able to use his Influence skill on, which was the reason for capturing him in the first place. Although, even Quinn had been unable to bypass his mental defenses, the group had decided to keep him prisoner, for one he had tried to kill their members and the second reason, they thought they might eventually find a way to get information out of him at some point.

It was then that Fex had come up with another use for him. Agent 11 had a strong body, and was able to use the power of Qi, not to mention he was close enough to being a single agent, the strongest type in Pure.

Fex had briefly tested him out with his puppeteering skills and he had turned out better than the vampire had imagined. During this fight, for the first time Agent 11 would be even stronger thanks to his blood weapon.

The masked men, seeing one more person who wasn't an ally, started to charge in. Agent 11 had no choice, tightly gripping onto the sword in his hand, he channeled his Qi through it.

"Just focus on your Qi, relax your body and let me do the rest!" Fex shouted.

It was a hard thing to do, especially since Agent 11 could see someone charge at him, but he knew what Fex meant. Agent 11 had reluctantly been used as Fex's practice tool on his downtime, and he knew that it was worse for him to go against the flow.

Soon, using his sword, a slash even faster than Agent 11 was ever capable of using, sliced the masked man's hand off.

The vampire swivelled around holding his arm, and noticed that the wound wasn't healing.

'Haha, I hope you enjoy this surprise. It looks like you guys have never fought against someone who can use Qi before.' Fex thought gleefully as he continued to control Agent 11.

With his sword, he sliced the vampires in his way, thrusted them down, and finished most of them with a single strike to the point where they could no longer get up.

As for the other side, they too had decided to charge towards Dennis, but now that Fex was able to deal with a majority of them, Dennis' load had lessened. The gorilla was able to help out massively, as it leapt through the air, slamming its giant fists on two of them, and then using its smaller arms underneath to continue to punch the vampires on the ground.

"I'm not going to lose out to a freaking gorilla!" Dennis shouted, as he went forward and continued to fight with his fists as well. He had used up his MC cells, unable to cast his shadow ability, which was why his fighting had also turned more beast-like. He continued to punch, with the gorilla, and held off the enemies in front of him.

Eventually, Dennis had slipped on some blood and caught himself but was now down on one knee. A masked vampire saw this as the right time, throwing a claw towards the back of Dennis' head. Reaching out the vampire was inches away before a burning sensation was felt on its head, and soon it fell to the floor, before it succeeded in its attack.

'What was that, acid?' Dennis wondered, as he continued to fight, and glanced at the tree where the attack had come from. There he could see that there was a snake-like beast in the tree, and now it was helping them as well. Shooting out acid towards the masked on the ground.

"I don't know who is controlling these beasts, but I'm going to have to thank them!"

With excitement and support by his side, Dennis was feeling invincible, ignoring the wounds that he had received, just focusing on the fight. He was pushing himself beyond what his body was already capable of.

Pain was a sign for the body to stop what it was doing, to tell it, that it was in trouble and as a result, Dennis didn't realise just how much he had been hurt. When going to punch someone, he was a few seconds slower as his rib cage had been cracked from an earlier hit, and it looked like the few remaining vampires noticed this as well, ready to at least take one of them down.

'Crap…I didn't get to…I didn't get to even spend that week off with Megan.' Was going through Dennis' mind as he saw the fists coming towards him, almost in slow motion, but there was nothing he could do about them.

"You're not dying on my watch, old man!" Fex shouted, running across Dennis' back, and kicking two of the vampires' heads in front of him. Fex then quickly pulled one forward with his string and sliced it from the head down in half finishing the last few remaining ones.

Dennis, seeing Fex back could see that his black needle was in his back.

"What happened to them? Huh?" Dennis said, confused.

"That guy is good enough to handle himself. After dealing with most of them, I let him do his own thing and used the power of the needle on me." Fex replied.

Eventually the group had dealt with all forty of the masked men. With this brief break it looked like no more masks were coming in their direction. They wondered if it was because the enemy thought that they would be finished by now, or had they really defeated all those coming from this direction.

Either way, they had time to rest and with the humans they had killed, both Dennis and Fex consumed their blood as they started to recover. Eventually, Fex picked up the wooden crate that was still in good condition.

"Alright, we should be good now. Come on, you know the drill." Fex clapped his hands looking at Agent 11.

"Seriously? I just saved your asses! Heck, I didn't even try to run away, yet you want me to return to that stuffy box? When's the last time you even cleaned it!" Agent 11 wasn't too keen to listen to that order.

"Oh please, where would you have even run off to? We're on an island with all sorts of people trying to kill us. Just get in the box!" Fex ordered, getting his strings ready.

"Look, I promise I will help you guys, just don't put me back in there! I won't resist if you control me, or puppet me or anything! We both know that if it wasn't for me, he would have died and you should at least reward me for that right?" Agent 11 argued, pointing towards Dennis.

"Just let him stay outside. He did help us after all." Dennis took his side, relaxing and allowing the blood to heal their wounds.

"Argh, fine! But just this once, and don't even think about getting away!" Fex loocked eyes with the gorilla that was still alive. "Gorilla, keep an eye on him."

Fex was annoyed, but at the same time worried that Pure Agent was just waiting for a better opportunity to make a run for it. It had taken him a long time to find someone this good he could use, but it looked like Agent 11 was staying close by.

Fex decided to go up to his attackers hoping to get a good look at them and one was lying in the grass.

'Why do they even wear these masks, is it to cover up their ugly faces?' Fex thought, taking one of them off, revealing the man's face.

'He's not ugly enough to need a mask, in fact he's actually quite handsome. I wonder why they all use those masks then? I don't recognize this guy." Fex thought, thinking it was one of the agents from the Vampire World. Not that Fex did know every single vampire in the settlement.

Out of curiosity, Fex decided to go to another masked man and took his off as well, and when he did, he had to rub his eyes twice because he couldn't believe what he was seeing…

"What the… were those two twins?"

*****

# Chapter 1290 - A Copy Of A Copy
After seeing the second person's face under the strange black mask all of them seemed to wear, something about it bothered Fex. Both of them looked identical… too identical even if they happened to be twins. Setting aside the small likelihood that the vampire just so happened to unmask two brothers, there was another explanation for their resemblance.

Fex gulped as he considered that possibility. He quickly went over to another masked man on the ground and started to pull his masks off as well. Dennis, Agent 11 and the gorilla were watching his strange actions from the side as they took a break to recover, wondering why he was acting like some type of mad man.

However, after they saw him pull off the sixth person's mask, they looked past his actions and were now looking at the details on his face. He was sweating, something vampires didn't really do, not even when tired, which meant most likely something was worrying him.

"They're the exact same!" Fex shouted in frustration. "All these masked men are the same! All of them must be clones of the same person."

Dennis finally got up to have a look at just what Fex was talking about… He was half hoping that perhaps the people just looked similar or that the other had just revealed the faces of identical sixtuplets, but their resemblance was uncanny.

The group dragged the corpses of those men next to each other, so they could get a closer look and a better comparison. However, it just made things even stranger because from head to toe, all the men were identical even in height.

"They must be clones! Didn't Quinn say that Eno could do the same? He also had multiple copies of himself." Dennis assumed and started to sniff the air. He had another thought and wanted to check something out.

Following his nose, it soon brought him to another masked person that Fex had yet to pull the mask off. After finding six people with the same face in the row, Fex didn't expect to see anything different from the others.

'It would make sense, I guess. If Richard could do it, his relatives might be able to aswelll, given that they should have the same power.' Dennis thought.

If Fex was to concentrate, he could still hear the sounds of fighting coming off from different directions. He knew that Richard could create clones, but this many?

"For frick's sake, this whole time, we've been fighting against bloody clones!" Fex continued shouting and cursing. "How is this fair? These guys aren't even real! No wonder there are so many of them! We have to fight with our lives on the line while they can just as easily be replaced!!!"

Eventually, Dennis had found his resolve to pull off the mask from the person in front of him, and what he saw underneath was finally something different to the other masked person. There was a woman who was already dead but there was something else that was different about her compared to the others as well.

"Come over here!" Dennis called out.

Out of interest, the gorilla and even Agent 11 had come over. The Pure Agent wasn't sure why exactly Fex and the others were on the island, but from what he had gathered they seemed to be up against what the world knew as V at the moment. He had seen their red eyes and powers. If he actually got a chance to escape he could use all of this information to rise within the Pure organization.

"This one's… a human." Fex sniffed the air to make sure, but he also remembered something else looking at the specific wound on her body. He had been the one to have killed her. Fex remembered this person well because she had been the only one that had used an ability against him.

"Wait, is that the reason?" Fex spoke his thoughts out loud. "We've fought against so many vampires, but none of them seemed to have an ability?"

"I've seen some vampires who don't have abilities. Is it that strange?" Dennis asked.

"Even in the pooling area, vampires chose different abilities from the thirteenth family, only those who haven't given up on a promotion would choose not to learn any ability."

"So you think the humans aren't clones? Do you think they abducted them, because clones can't learn abilities?" Dennis wondered.

"Couldn't it just be a case of those ones being created recently?" Agent 11 chimed in with his own opinion on the matter, mostly because he didn't have anything better to do and he was aware that he would literally get dragged into the Cursed faction's mess.

"If all your enemy needed was an army to overwhelm you guys, would he have bothered to prepare for it for a long time to teach them all abilities, or to find them? Perhaps it's more correct to say that whoever made these clones is unable to copy them with abilities in the first place. Otherwise he coudl teach one person an abaility and then clone them. Then again I'm no scientist."

While they were all busy thinking about how this information could possibly help them in their current fight, they could soon hear another wave of people coming towards them.

"Well I guess they aren't short on numbers, and I guess unlike us they don't really have to care about any losses." Dennis stretched his arms behind his back a few times, he could tell his body hadn't made a complete recovery yet and although blood from humans allowed them to heal, restoring their energy and stamina was another thing altogether.

Out from the large jungle trees, they could see more masked men appearing. Just like they had suspected it was another group.

"Isn't something a little off about them?" Fex asked moving in closer to where the others were, also twirling his fingers getting ready to attach them to Agent 11 at any moment.

As they got closer, Agent 11 noticed it as well, some of the masks they were wearing were cracked and at the same time they had wounds and blood dripping on their clothing. Before the group even reached them, the snake beast that helped them from before dropped from above, landing on three of them.

It let out its acid on a the other members, and all of the other Masked had fallen, but they seemed to be ignoring the snake that had just landed on some of them. On closer inspection, they looked to be in a hurry as they scuffled to try and continue running.

Before they knew it, a figure could be seen landing in front of the group, and as quickly as it landed, it dealt with the rest of the Masked, with a few hits.

'Isn't that Mona, one of the former Big Four? What is she doing here, in a place like this' Agent 11 was beyond shocked.

Mona turned around after dealing with them, and the snake that was on the ground slivered up and went around her neck. When turning she looked at those in front of her, and noticed how tired and torn their clothing were.

"I'm sorry. I was confident that I could stop them from coming and I was faring well with the Kraken beast. They just kept coming and coming, it felt like they were…"

"Endless." Dennis finished her sentence. "We've experienced the same thing. We're just happy that you took care of many of them and I think everyone on this island will agree. What happened to the beast that was with you?"

Mona was a strong woman who was usually brimming with confidence, but when asked this question the others found it strange that this confidence had vanished from her face, and they weren't sure if they were imagining it or not, but could see her shudder slightly.

"The Kraken… it's dead." Mona answered, looking away from the others, her eyes full of pain.

"I guess, not even a Demon tier beast can handle an army of vampires." Fex noted, almost proud of this fact.

"No, it wasn't done by the Masked." Mona replied. "It was something else. Honestly, I'm not sure I should tell you, guys… it might make you give up on this fight as well… Do you think it's too late for all of us to give up on this mission?"

All of them were wondering just what Mona could have seen, that could convince her that retreat might actually be the best option.

*****

# Chapter 1291 - Going Back
Out of all the Cursed groups that had split up, one was faring a lot better compared to the others and that was Sam's group. Most of this was actually thanks to the synergy between Layla and Nate.

With her acting as the group's marksman, now that she had improved her powers she could injure most of the Masked before they got too close. Nate would be there to fight off those who had evaded her attacks, while allowing Sam to pick off the weaker ones in the back.

Layla was able to freely change between her three forms, so whenever they had a short break, she would transform into her third form, allowing her use the special flames to heal any injuries Nate and Sam, while also renewing their buffs.

There were a few times that they had struggled, in particular whenever the Masked had attacked with ability users in their midst. However, for those occasions, they had an ace in the team that their enemy had no way of dealing with, which was, once again, Layla.

Whenever they came across a troublesome ability user, Layla would quickly change into her second form and join the fray from up close. This would put more pressure on Nate and Sam, but a few four legged beasts also had come to their aid to help them fight.

None of the ability users were prepared to go up against someone who was capable of negating every single ability there was out there, making it easy for the young woman to finish off the troublesome ones…

'This is the power of having real support on our team.' Sam realised as they struggled through a new wave of Masked. 'If we'll ever have to fight this type of battle again, it would be best if we had more supportive abilities to help out the groups."

'However… just how many of those Masked are there? No matter how many we kill, their number doesn't seem to drop. If anything I think they're getting more numerous with each new wave. I'm not sure if the other two have noticed it, but each time we're getting pushed further back.'

"Sam!" Nate called out. "I'm nearly out of blood. My flask is practically empty."

This was another problem. Although Nate's stamina was great, better than most in the Cursed faction, and although nearly none of them had been injured, there was the issue of blood. Using their blood abilities allowed Sam and Nate to perform strong attacks, but without blood not only would it make them weaker they could no longer produce their red aura.

"Let's head closer to the castle!" Sam ordered.

Everyone started to slowly retreat. With no end in sight, Sam was trying to figure out how they would win this. After all, their victory condition was having to make sure the enemy didn't get the Demon tier beast. Unfortunately, he lacked critical information about how the other sides were doing, and he had a strange feeling not too long ago, he didn't think it was a good sign.

As the group was moving back, Sam could feel the back of his hair move violently, as if a storm was coming. He had a premonition that it might be dangerous to turn around, but his fear that it could be the enemy made him take a quick look, only to see a black feathered beast he hadn't seen before.

"Sam, we need a new plan!" The beast shouted, that he recognised as sort of Vorden's.

"I know, but it's kinda hard to come up with something, while we're surrounded by the enemy!" Sam replied back, slightly annoyed with the tone Vorden had given the second he had arrived.

Before Sam could say anything else, another strange creature ran past him, also passing Nate and Layla as well.

Turning around, they could see that it looked like a person, who wore the same black clothing as the Masked. However, he seemed to have cut off the sleeves of the clothing. The next moment they saw why, as both his hands formed into two gigantic blades.

The second the strange person had disappeared into the jungle, he started to slice down all of the Masked one by one. Most of them weren't even able to retaliate, as for those who did, their red aura proved to do nothing to the assailant.

"Raten can deal with any of the Masked that come our way. Now, how about we talk?" Vorden asked again.

Hearing who the strange person was, Sam could only reach one conclusion which was that Raten must have evolved and was now inside the body of humanoid Demon tier beast. With this revelation, Sam believed that they might have a chance.

"Quin just sent us over to Wevil's group. He's dead and Linda can no longer fight. Borden should have brought his body back to the castle and is probably looking after Linda now. This fight… it's worse than we thought. Apart from the Masked, there're also Dalki!"

"Judging by the look on your face, I assume you must have thought that with me and Raten having evolved we might stand a chance of winning this, right?" Vorden asked. "I thought the same, until I saw what state Linda was in."

"Even if we can win this fight, we might even be lucky if more than a few of us will actually survive. Quinn was right, Eno doesn't care about us. We need a better plan!"

Sam had mixed feelings after hearing the news. He had prepared himself for the possibility that some of the Cursed faction were going to die after finding out who they were going up against, knowing the enemy would surely have some tricks up their sleeves, but it still felt surreal at the moment.

Worst of all, he didn't even have time to grieve over Wevil because Sam needed to think up their next course of action to prevent anymore losses.

"There's more news!" Fex shouted over.

Towards the castle, the heavy grown jungle area lessened. The trees and grass were thinned out, giving a more open area allowing for everyone to see each other easier. When turning around. Sam could see Fex and the rest with them. He found it strange they were travelling with a gorilla, but when seeing Mona, and considering the beasts that had helped them at the cost of their own lives, Sam didn't find it too strange anymore.

With the three groups meeting up, and Raten in the jungle making sure no one got close to the castle, all of them shared the information they had gathered.

There were three key points to take note of.

First, nearly all of the Masked they were facing were clones. If Richard could create clones it made sense that Jim could as well, but one question popped up in all their heads. Where exactly were Richard Eno's clones right now?

The information brought from Vorden was that there were also Dalki here, which they had predicted would come at some point. Additionally, he had brought the sad news of Wevil's death. Everyone went silent for a moment before they continued to talk again, but the worst piece of news by far was the news that Mona had brought them.

It was because of this, Sam had made the decision.

"We have to give up on the Demon tier beast." Sam concluded. "We will leave this island. I thought that the location of the teleporter was subpar, so I had Logan create another one just in case. If he hasn't finished it yet, I don't think he will need much longer. Most of us are weak and can't continue fighting, it's the only thing we can do."

"The teleporter is at the Temple."

"What about Quinn?" Fex asked. "Don't we need to tell him as well? What's he even doing at the moment?"

Just as Fex had asked that question, a loud roar from the Dragon was heard. Since they were close it felt like they could feel its power just from the roar it had made.

"We can inform Quinn he will come, but he has something important to do first." Vorden answered.

——

A while ago, Quinn had gotten his body back from Vincent, only to find himself facing the trio of Blades. As the three of them were together, Quinn could feel something, a couple of his connections, his links to those that he turned were in trouble. It still hadn't gotten to the point where it was life threatening but he knew they needed help.

He was about to go himself, but as he was, a voice spoke to him once again. The tablet not too far from where they were had lit up once more but the voice when it spoke sounded weaker than it ever had done before.

"Quinn! Quinn can you hear me? It's Ray!" The voice must have been shouting, but all Quinn could hear was a faint whisper. "I've been watching everything that has been going on, and I'm here to tell you that you can't win this fight! Not the way you are right now!"

"If you stay here, you and all your people will lose their lives for nothing. You have to leave this island! I thought you had a chance since you seem to possess a certain amount of strength, but I've just felt something far stronger than you out there!"

"There is a chance that once you leave this island that they will also destroy it. Even if they don't they may certainly take an interest in this tablet. If that is the case, if I get destroyed then… I can't fathom what will happen to this world and its abilities. Most likely, it will leave the human race with no chance at all."

Listening to what Ray had to say, Quinn believed it, mainly because he could tell from his connections how certain members of his were struggling.

"I've seen your shadow power, perhaps there is a way you can place the tablet in your shadow. Please, if at all possible, YOU HAVE TO PROTECT THE TABL-!!!."

The glow of the tablet went down once again, but Ray had said enough for Quinn to take him seriously.

'Take the tablet with us? That's easier said than done. I doubt the Dragon will just let me take it, even if I ask him nicely…'

# Chapter 1292 - Get The Tablet
"We have to help him!" Layla insisted after finding out what Quinn was currently doing. "We couldn't do anything against that Dragon last time, so Quinn will surely need our help!"

"I don't think Quinn is reckless enough to give up his life, Layla. Besides, do you really think you can help him?" Vorden asked, his tone harsher than he had intended. "Honestly, we all have gotten stronger and I know you've been training hard, but we're already hard pressed to deal with all of the Masked. Eventually, even Raten will tire out and they will storm this castle and the rest of the areas."

The others didn't say anything. They too wanted to help Quinn, but wondered what use they would be if they headed over. Those who knew him were aware that Vorden would never abandon his best friend, so the decision to stay out of his way couldn't have come lightly.

"Vorden is right." Sam agreed, breaking the silence. "Quinn has the highest chance of survival out of all of us. Given his Shadow ability, he'll be able to flee if left with no other choice… Our situation is different, though. We need to go through the second teleporter to get off this island and I suggest we do so now, before anything unforeseen happens."

Although it was obvious that Layla wasn't pleased by this outcome, she understood that time was of the essence. Before heading to the Temple, they all decided to stop by the castle to gather Wevil's body and Linda.

"Hey, did any of you see Peter?" Nate suddenly asked, before they set out.

They all looked at each other and realised that the last time they had seen him was when he was digging through Hilston's things. After that point, they had lost him.

Just where had he run off to during this whole mess? Most importantly, was he still safe and okay? Sam tried to call Peter on his communicator, but it looked like communication down on the island as well. The same thing when trying to contact Quinn.

"Maybe if we get to the temple, the jammers that Logan has set up will let our communication devices work again." Sam theorised, but he also knew that would mean more time without knowing what had happened to Peter.

"I'll go look for Peter." Vorden volunteered. "I'm the least injured out of all of us, I can move quite fast, and I can even try to find him from above ground. Get Borden first and then just head to the Temple. If you have to, just go through it!"

———

It was important that the group didn't leave the Dragon on its own. After all, capturing him was the enemy's overall objective. With Eno having been sent flying and Brock having followed behind his master, Quinn was the only one there to look over it.

However, after listening to Ray's warning, he suddenly had a new task, making Quinn struggle with what to do.

'I know Ray said to get the tablet and I understand the importance of the tablet, but doesn't that mean, we have practically admitted defeat? They might be unable to take the Dragon immediately, but if we leave them to it, what if they succeed?' This was the reason why Quinn hadn't acted just yet.

However, he didn't want to do just nothing and had decided to send Vorden and the others to help out the Cursed faction. Although Raten seemed to believe that as a humanoid Demon tier beast he was strong enough to match the Dragon, Quinn was convinced he wasn't. He might not know how strong Raten was in his current form, but he had fought against the Dragon previously, so he knew just how strong it was.

'I know it's hard to admit defeat Quinn. We might not have seen the main perpetrator behind the attack, but you said it yourself. This fight is not worth sacrificing the lives of your friends over. At worst, just try to think of this as a backup plan that we are putting into action now.'

Vincent's words had put his grandson's head on a little straighter, making his decision easier. The least he could do was obtain the tablet. Still, there was no doubt that the Dragon would try to stop him.

'Since it's not a living thing I should be able to place it into my dimensional space, but it looks pretty rooted into the ground. I'll need to take it out somehow.' Quinn thought, wondering just how long that would take.

'How do I get the Dragon to not attack me? What if I used Shadow lock on the dragon and moved it with us? If I use Shadow overload could I be able to take the Dragon away as well?'

Quickly images of the Dragon breaking out of the Shadow lock and destroying everything on board the Cursed Ship appeared in Quinn's head. In the first place, he wasn't even sure Shadow lock would even work on a being so strong and large.

Looking at his other options, Quinn's eyes landed on the Roseus tree. It was thanks to this that the Cursed faction and everyone had even been able to last so long. It was also why Quinn was aware of just how many the enemy numbered.

'Maybe there's some way I can use the tree.'

When using the Roseus tree, after most of the beasts had been defeated, Quinn had attempted to Mark the Masked that were attacking them as well. He could sprout and control its roots after all. However, all his attempts had ended in failure because he wasn't even able to get the chance to Mark them.

The enemy attackers were on high alert, and it felt like it was almost impossible to grab hold of them. Even when Quinn had succeeded, for some reason marking them had required far longer than a beast. Whether it had something to do with their forms of intelligence or not, he didn't know.

Either way, during the process the other Masked had attacked the roots, and Quinn had been able to feel some of his energy leak out from the cut parts. It also didn't feel like it would come back, at least not in a short while, hence why Quinn had stopped that experiment.

'I'm starting to understand why the old Demon tier tree had spent years Marking people and beasts. It must have done so while people were asleep, or at the perfect moment while others weren't aware.'

Still, perhaps Quinn could use the multiple roots, and the larger ones that were close to the main Roseus tree to his advantage. After all, Blade Island might be a place that none of them would return to again, so this might very well his last opportunity to use the tree.

'I need something more, the Demon tier tree by itself won't be enough to slow it down.' Closing his eyes Quinn activated the amulet. His Dalki fighters had done well. Many of them were able to implement the martial arts skills that Quinn used, even with partial control.

It was because of this they were able to do a better job than the other two spiked Dalki. However the numbers were overwhelming and eventually just like the Cursed members who had to retreat it was the same for the Dalki.

'I can use their energy, but I know this won't be enough as well so there is only one thing I can do.' Quinn thought as he stood up and looked towards the tablet.

'This is guaranteed to cost me MC cells, but there's no other choice, I'm afraid.''

[Shadow Overload enhancement type soul weapon activated.]

All of Quinn's shadows started to pour out of him and consumed him, giving him a shadow body. His shadows flicker with a slight purple glow, and stepping out, Quinn was ready to face the Dragon ahead.

Stepping onto the open field, almost immediately the Dragon turned Quinn's way, and rather than staring at him for a few seconds like last time, it had already opened its maw to produce its giant orange flames.

It looked like whatever effect Ray used to have on the Dragon was no longer in effect.

Quinn swung both arms forward, creating a wall of shadows to block the flames, or make the flames stay in place.

"That's twice that someone blocked your fire attack. I guess you're not that scary of a lizard after all!"

Now that Quinn knew his shadow could stop the Dragon from hurting him, it was time he gave it everything he got. The Demon tier amulet around his chest started to glow.

*****

# Chapter 1293 - Jim's Grudge
At first Quinn had believed that he would have to drain the strength of the Dalki, but realising that his Shadow overload skill was enough to hold the Dragon, he decided to spare them. The Vampire Lord was sure he might need them later and instead of him directly lifting the tablet from the ground, there was a better person, or in this case being, for the job.

'I only have a limited amount of time using Shadow overload, and I would like to use it for as little as possible otherwise my MC cells are going to take quite the hit.' Quinn thought, as he continued to block the flames coming from the Dragon's mouth.

With both of them seeing that the flames weren't effective, Quinn knew what was going to happen next. Just as Vincent had watched it do in the fight against Eno, the Dragon turned its body, ready to use its gigantic tail, but Quinn was preparing his own thing as well.

[Skill activated Shadow void]

Shadow had been spreading across the ground far and wide ever since Quinn had activated his soul weapon, now that he had activated the skill, a large dome-like shadow covered both of them. Seeing the incoming tail, Quinn quickly sank into his shadows and appeared above the Dragon falling towards its back.

The middle part of the tail hit nothing but air, yet the tip of it scratched the outside of the dome. To Quinn's surprise this left a hole in the dome, yet his shadows started to gather there, as if it was healing from a cut…

'Looks like it really wants to get out of this place, but I'm right where I want to be.' Quinn took a glance at the tablet and tree that had also been trapped inside the dome. His current plan required him to buy time for the tree to follow his new command.

He had to make sure the tree wouldn't be hit by any of the Dragon's attacks. It might have come from a Demon tier tree and Quinn knew that it had roots all over the island, yet he didn't want to gamble on how sturdy it was.

Fortunately, the Dragon seemed to be fully focused on him.

This was great for Quinn, since it meant the Demon tier beast had yet to notice the roots that had started to dig at the base of the tablet. As they sprouted from the ground around it, they used their tips like hands, trying to pull it from above, while pushing it from the ground underneath, yet neither method seemed to be working on first glance.

'I can tell you're strong and I'm currently still too weak to defeat you.' Quinn thought. 'Which is why, I'll have to borrow your power again, so I can protect you!'

His white gauntlet hand was placed onto the back of the Dragon and the active skill was activated once more. Power was quickly going into Quinn as the Dragon roared even louder in anger, doing his best to get rid of the pest on him.

It was at that moment that Quinn felt something else. He had felt the connection to those he had turned fluctuate every so often, however this time one had been cut. The life of one of his companions had been lost, and once again he had not been there to prevent it.

"ARGHHH!" Quinn screamed even harder, full of pain as the energy continued to spread into his body, while tears started falling down his face.

——

An unknown distance away from where Quinn and the Dragon were, Eno had left the cave in the waterfall and had spotted someone he didn't think he would run into all the way out here.

"You're looking quite well for an old timer, but you don't have to be so loud. My ears are good enough to hear you even if you were to just whisper my name." Jim spoke to him in a casual tone.

His choice of garments was that of a typical vampire, meaning he was mostly covered in black while also wearing a long trench coat. He looked to be in his thirties, yet his hair style was completely out of place for the current age, indicating his real age. Jim had grand sideburns that covered his sides, while his hair was overrun at the top with curls which were nevertheless neatly kept up for its shape.

Richard was slightly surprised that the Dalki by Jim's side were merely one spikes. He would have thought that one of the masterminds behind this whole fight would have had better guards than that, at least three or four spikes.

"Your appearance hasn't changed.'' Richard noted, as he casually jumped from the rock he was on and landed on the land just by the river. The two of them now were a good ten meters away from each other, yet neither one had opened hostilities.

Before Jim had been a Vampire knight working under his nephew Vincent, he had been the previous leader, which was why it was very strange for a vampire Jim's age to still have his young appearance. Realistically, he should have weakened by now.

"What have you done? …have you really fallen that low? To use the lives of humans to extend your own?" Richard asked in disbelief.

Jim started to chuckle at his ancestor's reaction.

"And what if I have? Don't the vampires also use humans, even if they are mere clones for their blood supply. How have you not been able to face the simple reality that human lives are meant to be used by us? Aren't you wearing a set of Blood armour created from dead vampires? How are you any different from me in that regard?"

"We are different from the beginning." Richard insisted. "You only exist because of me! Jim, I did my best to try and sympathize with you, but I'm still unable to understand why you chose to go through with this madness! I understand that you've been wronged, that your accomplishments have always been diminished, but then shouldn't your anger be directed at the vampire settlement? Why are you helping the Dalki, no why are you trying to get rid of the humans?"

During their conversation, it sounded as if Richard was getting angry at points, only to quickly settle down soon after calming himself. Jim just smiled, yet this simple genuine gesture was all the more frightening. He seemed happy for the chance to talk with Richard as if he had been looking forward to it.

"Does it really look this way to you? Our side is the one who has united Humans, Vampires and even Dalki, all working together. Doesn't that sound like a perfect utopia to you? As for your question, don't worry, I'm going to teach the vampires their lesson soon enough."

"What do you think will happen when all the human's in existence are gone from this universe? Those vampires think that they are more important than humans, but don't realise that they are actually weaker."

"I don't just want to beat them, no I want to make them suffer. I will get rid of every drop of blood and I shall enjoy watching them starve until eventually they will realise that there is only one alternative left for them."

"The Dalki." Richard concluded. "So your reason is so petty. Is it because the vampires rejected your idea, rejected you and the Dalki, that you are forcing them to come crawling to you for help?! How childish is that?!"

Richard didn't think he had gotten all the answers from Jim about why he was doing what he was doing, but this conversation had made one thing clear. Jim's mind was made up and there was no way of changing that.

Since there was no way to get through to him by talking, Richard started to gather his hands together and the spire on the top of his head glowed.

"Come on, are you really going to attack me?" Jim asked, letting out a sigh. "As I recall, you still owe me a favour which I never got the chance to make use of. Don't you believe in fairness, equivalent exchange? Well, I would say now's the perfect time to call in that favour."

"It's rather simple, really. 'Don't get in my way'. Just let me pass and watch as I subdue the Demon tier beast. Otherwise…"

Jim placed his hand on the Dalki by his side. The back of the Dalki started to light up. A change was occurring as energy flowed through the creature. It was brief but for a second it looked like Richard could catch something that looked to be embedded in the palm of Jim's hand.

'A crystal of some sort?'

A few seconds later as the light faded, the Dalki's appearance had drastically changed. It had grown an entire foot larger, sprouted wings on it's back, its scale-like features had gotten more compact, and darker, and worse of all the number of spikes on its back had changed.

In total there were six spikes present.

******

# Chapter 1294 - Don't Have To Kill
Something that Quinn had to keep reminding himself as he went to face the Dragon, was that his goal in this fight wasn't to defeat it, just to buy time. It was a foreign feeling, when faced with a beast, but eventually it had gotten through to him.

It was why he had opted to land on the giant beast's back, allowing him to hold onto its scales as it struggled. As a Vampire Lord his grip strength was enough to withstand the Dragon's efforts of shaking him off, yet given the hardness of its scales it was also almost impossible for Quinn to do the beast any real damage, but he didn't need to.

All he needed to do was distract the beast while the tree did its job.

Using this opportunity to his advantage and remembering what he had done to the Dragon before, Quinn wickedly used the active skill in his gauntlet.

"I couldn't protect someone again!" Quinn screamed in anger as a power stronger than any he had felt before was entering his body. "Someone died to protect your ungrateful scaly ass, you overgrown lizard!!!!"

The Dragon, feeling the strange sensation it had felt once before, started to flap its giant wings heading upwards. Quinn, still not having retracted the Shadow Void, understood what it was trying to do. He could tell that the dome wouldn't hold out based on the strength it had shown before, but there was something else he could do…

With the Dragon lifting off, it had pushed through the dome destroying the upper shadow, revealing the blue sky above and the beast kept going up. Quinnn was finding it easier to hold on as he had more strength than before, and he could see that inch by inch the tablet had nearly come loose.

Next, with one hand on the beast, Quinn started to form a giant shadow portal above. Right where the Dragon was to take flight, and as it rose, it had gone through it, only to find itself appearing right on the ground where it was once before.

Quinn had activated his Shadow sink, and with his Shadow overload he was able to produce the shadows wherever he wished. No matter how often the Dragon tried to get him off, Quinn would make them return back to the ground.

'It's working! I might not be strong enough to kill it, but at least I can make sure it doesn't go anywhere!' Quinn thought.

After what felt like an eternity, Quinn could finally see that the Roseus tree had completed its task. A thirds of the large tablet had been stuck in the ground which was why it had taken so long for the tree to get it out.

The energy drained from the Dragon was powerful but it seemed like the gauntlet had reached some sort of limit, no more energy was being passed onto Quinn. There was no use staying on the Dragon any longer.

Running up to the top of his head, Quinn gathered the Qi in his legs and used his strength to push off from the Dragon to the ground where the tablet was. Soon, he started to form a Shadow on his back and from there two large black wings were formed, giving him a safe soft landing.

[Dimensional space activate]

A shadow appeared underneath the tablet, and it started to sink into Quinn's dimensional space. Allowing him to take it with him.

'Thanks for the power boost.' Quinn gave him a grin, as he wiped away the tears. 'I hope you'll put up a good fight when they try to take you on.'

Running out of the open area, Quinn deactivated his Shadow overload skill. He was ready for the backlash of using the skill, checking just how many of his MC points would be taken away. At the same time Quinn made sure to see what the Dragon would do next.

As he neared the jungle, he saw the Dragon land directly on top of the Roseus tree, crushing it with its massive weight. Quinn immediately felt the energy escape from his Demon tier Amulet, and he was unable to control it in any way.

Quinn was thankful that the tree had helped him out so much, and hoped this had at least been a quick death without much pain. He could have never imagined that one little seed would aid him to this degree. He didn't even want to imagine how much trouble he and the Cursed faction would have gone through without the Roseus tree.

'With the tablet gone, will you remain in this place?' Quinn wondered. 'That's why you stayed on this island for so long, right? As long as you don't follow after me, you should enjoy your freedom for as long as you can.'

[You must now pay your debt for using Shadow overload]

Quinn knew this was coming. Each time he had used the Shadow overload skill, he had to pay the price for it afterward. The first time, Quinn had very little MC cells to use, so when using his soul weapon it had run out quickly fighting Cindy.

It was later that he learned the more MC cells he had, the longer the Shadow Overload skill could last, which was why it hadn't run out even though he had been battling against the Dragon for a while.

Quinn just knew that along with the increased time allowing him to use the soul weapon for, the cost had similarly increased. However, he had yet to figure out if the system calculated it based on the duration alone, or the quantity of shadows he used within that time.

[-100 MC cells]

[10/1000 MC]

Seeing this Quinn wasn't too shocked by the result. For one, although it had taken a large amount, Quinn still had a large number of MC cells left. What did surprise him, however, was how close he had been to having used up all his MC cells.

It also looked like he had somewhat gotten his answear. That it was a mixture of time used, as well as the amount of shadow Quinn used while using the skill.

If it had taken any longer his soul weapon would have deactivated. Right now, Quinn didn't even have the MC cells remaining to cast some of his Shadow skills. Thankfully, the Shadow link skill didn't require any to be used, and Quinn might not even need to use his Shadow powers in the first place, for he was filled with more energy than he could imagine from the Dragon.

'Although the Shadow overload skill is strong, the more I use it, the further I feel like I am getting away from Arthur.' Quinn thought.

While looking at his stats, Quinn kept an eye on what the Dragon was doing. It had walked around the place, even digging in places, apparently searching for the tablet which was now in his possession. Unable to find it, the Demon tier beast started to flap its wings.

'Yes, get away from this place! As far as possible, just make sure the Dalki don't catch you!' Quinn thought, but he knew that perhaps they would eventually track it down again, and possibly before them.

Thinking about this, Quinn wondered why Eno and Brock hadn't returned. They had been away far too long, they should have at least returned by now, and he also wondered how the Cursed faction were doing.

Quinn would have to make a choice between returning to the others, or search for Eno. It didn't take him long to decide that with the Dragon about to take off, his priority was how the others were doing.

The Dragon soon went up into the sky, and it looked like it was hovering around the island for a little longer as it was deciding what to do. Quinn wanted to keep an eye on it, but he soon heard the sound of footsteps.

Turning his head, he could hear them coming from all sorts of different directions, His eyesight was able to keep up with them all, and he could see. From each direction there were groups, groups and groups of Masked.

'What happened to my friends? Did those Masked manage to defeat them all?' Quinn worried, but other than the connection he felt go earlier, he couldn't feel anyone else in trouble at the moment.

A red aura strike came towards Quinn, and moving his hand ever so slightly touching the aura with his finger tips it smashed on impact. The one who attacked Quinn, in seconds Quinn had moved and now had his hand gripped around his throat.

"You guys will all pay for this!" Quinn declared, as a large shadow reached behind his back, and consumed the masked person he was holding. Seconds after the masked man started to scream widely.

[Shadow eater skill successful]

[10 MC cells gained]

——

The Dragon continued to hover over the island, roaring in anger, but it seemed to have suddenly realised that there was no longer any reason for it to stay, making it look towards the blue sky above.

However, before it could appreciate its newfound freedom, it felt something slam down on its back. The force was so strong that the Dragon screamed in pain, as it plummeted down, shaking the entire island.

*****

# Chapter 1295 - A Gift From Him
The group had made a decision, and with it, Vorden had gone off into the forest to search for Peter while the others headed towards the castle before they would make their way to the Temple on the island.

Before leaving, Vorden had headed to where Raten was, informing him to come back and stay closer to the castle. It would be his job to make sure that no Masked got too close to the area for now.

Inside the castle, the group had entered the room where Linda was present.

They all could see her lying there peacefully on her bed, free from wounds, not even aware that she had visitors. Since her clothes had been tattered during the fight, Borden had dressed her in another set… a French maid outfit.

Borden saw the strange eyes of the others looking at him, questioning his choice of attire.

"It was the only thing I could find in this place, I swear!" Borden tried to explain himself, getting all red faced. "She was out of it, and we had to leave her large Armour behind. We couldn't take it with us and until she wakes up, she can't use her Shadow equip to put on her regular armour and I couldn't just leave her half naked!!!…"

"Don't try to explain yourself, bro." Fex said, placing his hand on Borden's shoulder. "The more you try to explain yourself the guiltier you look. Besides, I think you made a good choice."

There was another block head in the room who also appreciated the outfit, but even he knew better than to use this moment to make a crude joke about Borden's taste.

Knowing that they needed to leave, and with no signs of Linda waking up, one of them would have to carry Linda along with them. Borden had quickly volunteered for the task, but for some reason the others didn't think it was a good idea for him to be carrying her, instead everyone agreed that Mona was a good choice. With her beast armour she had inhuman strength so it was no problem for her either.

If necessary, Fex could use his string ability as well, allowing Mona to use her hands and legs while fighting. After picking up Linda's body, the group moved into the room next door, to find Wevil's corpse lying on a bed. The sheets underneath it had been stained red from the blood on his clothes.

The feelings of the others in the room were filled with sadness, anger and even more. They all took a minute of silence to pay their respects to Wevil, before Fex eventually put the large wooden box that was on his back down.

"I won't let your body stay on this island, Wevil." Fex declared, carefully picking him up and gently putting him into the box which was fortunately quite well cushioned. After all, it had initially been designed to keep Agent 11 inside there even with Fex moving about widely.

"I'll make sure to protect you so that Linda gets to say her goodbye. I bet once we're back, Quinn will give you the best grave, allowing the rest of the Cursed faction to thank you for what you did for them." Fex spoke to the lifeless body.

"Can I help put the lid on?" Layla asked. Naturally, Fex agreed to her request. Before he knew it, everyone was grabbing the lid of the box and helped close it, before carefully placing it on his back.

"I know it's hard for all of you, but remember we have to keep moving." Mona managed to say. As one of the former Big Four she lost enough subordinates and friends, but she knew that as strong as the members of the Cursed faction were, it didn't change their young age. It looked like they had been blessed, to not have to experience such a thing often enough to grow used to it. Unfortunately, as an outsider, she felt like it was her job to keep the group moving, so that Wevil would be the only casualty.

After leaving the castle, the group was walking with Borden at the front. Not only because he was arguably the strongest among those present, but also because he knew the way to the Temple. As for Raten, as long as he didn't fight the Dragon he should be fine moving behind the others dealing with anyone that would follow as their rearguard.

"Th-that looks like it's the Dragon!" Layla pointed upwards.

The whole group turned as they could hear the Dragon's roar, and for the first time, it looked like it had left its place by the tablet.

'I hope this means Quinn is okay.' Layla silently prayed for his well being.

However, seconds later, a figure appeared just above where the Dragon was. Seeing it even from such a distance Mona instantly recognised it. After all, it was what had killed the Demon tier beast, her Kraken.

Seconds later and the small figure had knocked down the Demon tier beast. The force of impact when it collided with the ground was so great that the next second they could all feel the entire island shake violently. The rumbling of the ground was so great it felt like an earthquake that was going to sweep them off their feet.

"WE HAVE TO GET OFF THE ISLAND NOW!!!" Mona's hands were shaking, but she turned away from where the Dragon was, picking up her tempo, no longer caring whether the Cursed faction wanted to follow her or not, still carrying Linda along with her.

Meanwhile, the Cursed group had trouble believing their own eyes, that there could actually be something out there that could so easily deal with the large Demon tier beast.

"Don't worry, maybe Quinn can't do stuff like that but he's stronger than any of us." Nate said in an attempt to cheer everyone up. However, the truth was that he honestly doubted any human or vampire would be able to pull off a feat like that.

——

Out by the river, Eno was speechless after Jim had demonstrated he had the means to evolve a one spiked Dalki into a six spike in an instant.

'A six spike and so fast? Was my information wrong? I thought the highest spiked Dalki of the leaders was a five spike, yet my eyes aren't deceiving me, I can clearly count six spikes at this moment.' Richard thought.

It was at that moment, that the Dragon had been knocked out of the sky seconds later, making them all feel the aftermath.

"Just in case you thought they only looked the part, the one who took out that Dragon was another six spiked Dalki. Believe me, they're all the real thing." Jim said. "That Blood armour of yours is impressive, I give you that, but are you really confident that it will be enough to take on a six spike that just did that to a Demon tier beast?"

"It's true that the blood in my body is the same as in yours, hence why I'm giving you this chance. Let me turn in my favour now and the both of us can walk away from this freely. This is the last time I will ask, Richard."

"Which will it be, will you keep your word… or will you pretend to have forgotten why you are standing in front of me at this very moment?!"

Richard knew exactly what Jim was referring to.

"While I believe in the principle of equivalent exchange, what you're asking me to do means forsaking the entire human race! I alone might not be able to deal with your Dalki, but you yourself should be easy enough!" Eno shouted, as he lifted up both hands, and a red beam could be seen at the tip of both his fingers.

The next moment, two Blood bullets shot out. Jim's face made it clear that he hadn't actually expected his ancestor to refuse. He had been unable to react, however the now six spiked Dalki by his side had, placing his hand out, blocking the bullet that had been aimed at Jim's head, yet the other went right through shoulder, causing him to moan in pain.

"Damnit, why didn't you block them both, you numbskull!" Jim cursed. "Screw it, just get that ungrateful old geezer!"

The Dalki's hand that had blocked the Blood bullet, one of the vampires' strongest offensive Blood spells, was completely fine. The next second, the Dalki jumped from its position throwing its fist out towards Eno.

The red spire on the vampire's crown glowed, and just like when the Dragon had attacked with its flames, the Dalki only connected with an invisible pulse of red aura. It was similar to a wall while ripples of red aura were coming from where the Dalki had punched.

"That damned Blood armour. Eno, here I thought at least you could be reasoned with, but it seems like you're not the person I thought you were! I will take that armour for myself, and then take the king's armour as well!" Jim roared in anger.

It was at that moment, that another vampire leapt out from the jungle and swung its arm out towards Jim.

"Oh great, your lapdog has arrived!" Jim shouted recognising that the person was Brock. Opening a small portal by his side, Jim pulled out a shield from the portal that looked to have been made from diamonds.

The second Brock's arm touched the shield, it started to light up, and it felt like the power was being reflected right back towards him. His arm was breaking by the second, and the force seemed to be carrying on. Brock had no choice but to roll away from the ground, and now looking at his right arm, it was no longer where it was before. It had completely blown off.

"Hahha, you fool. Remember I am an Eno as well! Did you really think I would openly show all my cards? As you can see this was a little gift given to me, by your dear friend, Arthur. Vampires are so foolish, they have no idea just how powerful Demon tier equipment really is!"

"I want you to remember one thing, Richard, it was you who refused my offer!" Jim spat out, while placing his free hand on the other one spiked Dalki, whose body started to transform.

Brock and Richard were now faced with two six spiked Dalki as well as the tenth family former leader who had a Demon tier shield in his hands.

# Chapter 1296 - A Shadow Raven
For a while now, Quinn had remained on the same spot, fighting against hundreds and hundreds of Masked. However, he had yet to feel himself running out of energy. Using the power he had obtained from the dragon, he had managed to defeat each enemy with a single hit.

It wasn't that the Masked had just stood there, waiting to take a beating, but their red aura powers had proven completely useless. If the Cursed faction had really wanted to, he could have taken them all out far quicker, however the reason why he hadn't done so was because he was being careful.

In fact, he was careful to limit his damage to a point where he could use the Shadow eater skill, since this never ending mass of enemies proved to be a boon in disguise. Each one allowed him to gain 10 MC cells, which was great for his shadow ability and he had long since earned back the amount he had lost during his fight with the Dragon.

'Just getting more MC cells isn't going to make me stronger, but it will allow me to use the shadow ability in more ways. I also won't have to worry so much about using the Shadow Overload. I can feel that there are still more ways for me to use the Shadow Overload skill, but because of the drawback I couldn't really afford to play around with it for too long.''

'If I continue getting rid of all these, I can learn how to fight better and this in turn will improve my strength and it won't just be a temporary boost like the Dragon's energy I have in my body right now!' Quinn thought, as he quickly grabbed the head of two Masked and slammed them to the ground… He used his Shadow eater skill on one, forming a strange blob like shadow consuming its body, and then did the same to the next one.

[1360 MC cells in total]

[Congratulations]

[Shadow eater skill is now at level 2]

'Huh, so even the Shadow eater skill managed to evolve!' Quinn was surprised by this revelation, then again, he had never gone against this many vampires before, so he had been able to confirm if it was a skill he could even evolve from repetitive use.

[The Shadow eater skill can now consume more shadow from each vampire it is used on.

The Shadow eater skill's success chance has now increased.

The Shadow eater skill is now able to form different shapes based on the user's will.]

Reading through the changes, for a brief moment Quinn was happy. He had known that the Shadow eater skill's chance of success seemed to work based on how injured the vampires were that he used it against, yet there had still been cases when it had failed against a vampire who had been close to death.

Quinn's happiness was short lived though, as he looked around and the number of Masked that were near the open area still hadn't decreased.

'Are they trying to get past me, and head to where the Dragon landed from earlier!' Quinn wondered.

Once the island had shook, the vampires had suddenly stopped defeating Quinn and instead had attempted to run right past him. Rather than going after the Masked, Quinn decided to throw out his Shadow eater skill.

Thinking back, Quinn remembered the strange shadow that had appeared when he saw Arthur use his skill. He wondered if this was a shape Arthur chose. Due to how far away the person was who he wanted to use the skill on, in Quinn's mind a certain bird formed. Now, leaving from his hand, the shadow eater's skill looked slightly different from before, going out in the shade of a small black raven.

It also looked to be moving faster in this new form, and when it nearly reached the Masked, it opened its mouth wide, the shadow expanding far larger than the Masked person itself. A few seconds later and the Masked fell to the floor screaming in pain as it felt the suffering of being in the sun.

[12 MC cells consumed]

'That mask wasn't even injured and the shadow eater skill still worked, but it's still a little slower than hitting them myself.'

Quinn felt a mask coming directly towards him, and this time, instead of wounding it, he had acted on instinct, using his full strength to pound it away. He threw an overhead punch, and his first landed straight in the mask cracking it.

The mask broke off, and the vampire was no longer alive.

'Why, why even though I feel like I'm getting stronger, why do I not feel any better?' Quinn thought.

He had hoped that fighting would keep his mind off things,, but in his current condition the Masked proved to be too easy an opponent. This left Quinn free to think about other things, mostly the fact that he didn't even know which one of his friends had died, and that once again he had failed to protect them. Not to mention, he felt responsible for bringing them all here…

'Quinn wait, I think I saw something when you broke off that man's mask just now. Could you take the mask off of another one?' Vincent asked.

Of course with the way Quinn was now, and even before it wasn't too much trouble, he easily grabbed the face of one of the Masked who was too weak to resist, and quickly ripped the mask off his face.

'Alright…one more please.' Vincent asked. His tone seemed strange but Quinn knew Vincent would ask him to do that without any reason, which was why he didn't mind doing this one and continued to remove it from the next one as well.

'This… confirms it. They all look like Jim, they must be his clones.' Vincent clones.

'Jim? As in your old Vampire knight Jim? As in your uncle Jim who we suspect to be behind this whole mess? I knew that Eno could create clones, but how is it possible for Jim create this many?' Quinn asked, now also checking the faces of those he had defeated.

'Our ability is a strong one Quinn, and honestly sometimes it is not just how great the mind can be as for the person with the ability, but also how far the person is willing to go. Look at your system. We have thought for a while now that it is able to do incredible things thanks to my ability, and even know it continues to grow. As for Jim, this is proof he has gone beyond.

'Jim…why did he need to go to such lengths? Quinn, if it's at all possible, please allow me to talk to him.' Vincent requested.

——

Brock's severed arm had healed, blood was no longer falling down its side, however he now only had one good arm he could attack with, and seeing this, Jim was unable to hold in his laughter.

'"You are finished." Jim declared, and the next second the other six spiked Dalki who was on his side, had rushed over to where Brock was. Seeing this with his one good hand, Brock opened up the palm, and a large red ball of aura could be seen gathering.

As the Dalki was running straight forward, Brock knew for sure that the attack would hit. Releasing the attack, Brock's arm lifted in the air, as the recoil was strong. What he had just successfully used was the attack known as the Blood cannon.

A large red beam of aura had come out of Brock's hand and hit Dalki directly in the chest. The energy continued to hit the Dalki, until its whole body was absorbed by the red light. Eventually, the red aura ended.

The Dalki could be seen standing there, having skidded across the ground a few feet back.

"For you to have managed to push a six spike Dalki all the way back here, the power of a former Royal Knight is indeed strong. Unfortunately for you, it still isn't enough to actually injure him!" Jim taunted.

Watching the whole thing from the side, was Richard, who was still using the power of the red aura blood armour to block the Dalki's attack. Since the first punch had failed, the Dalki tried again with another punch. No matter how often he repeated it, each time it would just hit the invisible wall of red aura, creating new ripples.

'These Dalki, are too much for Brock to handle, and that Shield… we need to know what else it can do before we go against it.'

Lifting up one hand, a portal appeared above where Eno was, and an object was seen dropping from the sky, now in his hand, he held a giant lance that was spinning as he held it. Even now as he did nothing it continued to give off a strange red glow.

"There are different ways for us to use our ability. For me, I used them to create the strongest item I could possible." Eno said, as he thrusted the lance forward, and the spire on his head was no longer glowing.

The lance went straight for the Dalki that saw its chance to attack him. The Dalki, with its new found power decided to try grab the lance, but as soon as it did, it felt its skin ripping from its hard scales on its hands.

Feeling its power, for the first time the Dalki stepped back, looked at the green blood on its hands and noticed that the person responsible hadn't moved forward.

"You are weaker than I thought." The Dalki growled, having gained more energy from its injury.

The look on Eno's face spoke volumes. With that attack, he had expected to kill the Dalki or at the very least heavily injure it, yet it had done little more than give it surface wounds. Although Eno was safe due to his blood armour, Brock was not, and it looked like there was nothing he could do.

The six spiked dalki that was facing Brock, charged in again. When it was a few meters away from him, it saw something flash in front of It, and lifted up its arms. A clang was heard as the object hit the Dalki's arms, and to its surprise, now it's forearms had been cut, making it bleed.

"How? What could cause a six spiked Dalki to end up like that. Fair enough Eno's weapon but there should be no one else strong enough." Jim said.

It was then that they could see a pair of legs and a tail in front of Brock, with a headless man behind him.

"So this was where all the action was going on." Peter said, appearing by Brock's side.

# Chapter 1297 - Staying Back
After having had to fight off waves of Masked during the start of their attack, now it felt bizzare not encountering any. The lack of enemies didn't ease their minds, if anything it made them be on edge even more.

There were two possibilities the Cursed group had come up with as to why this was the case. One of them was that the Masked were no longer interested in them, most likely busy trying to subdue the Demon tier beast now that it was back on the ground. After all, that had always been their primary goal.

The second theory was that Raten was simply doing a far better job than any of them had expected, so well that not a single Masked had managed to get past him.

Whichever it was, it had allowed them to reach the Temple in a reasonable amount of time. There were no beasts nor any Masked outside, only a small person standing there to greet them.

"I expected that you would come eventually. It sounds like things have gotten rough out there." Logan said, leading the way inside… The group noticed the turrets he had set up, as he showed them where the teleporter was.

"There have been no signs of the enemy coming this way. Most likely because the Temple is too far away from where the Demon tier and the tablet were. Their group seems to be focusing only on their goal, which made my job easier."

"Why haven't you turned on the teleporter, Green?" Mona asked Logan. "That six spiked Dalki that took out my Kraken has managed to knock down the Dragon. After they're done, they'll most likely come after us and I doubt they'll be interested in capturing us. We shouldn't waste any more time and should be getting out of here!"

"It's on standby to avoid risking the enemy picking up anything to locate it. Besides, I can see that not everyone is present. First we should discuss what to do. I can't risk anyone panicking, going through, and destroying the teleporter on the other side, that would be disastrous for all of us still on the island." Logan explained.

"What do you mean?" Agent 11 questioned. "I thought we came here for all of us to just go through the teleporter? That other beast said he was getting one of you guys to bring him here, so what's the problem?"

It at least seemed like Mona and Agent 11 were on the same wavelength, but as for the rest of them… they looked at each other and it seemed like they all had already made up their mind.

Layla stood forward as if she was to speak for the others. "Quinn's Shadow ability might allow him to return to the Cursed faction at any point and time, and I honestly couldn't care less about Eno and his servant, but I still worry about Vorden and Peter. There's a chance that they might not be able to meet with Quinn, this could be the only way for them back."

"I will be staying here, protecting this place until the two of them return. We've already lost one person in our group. I don't want to lose anymore."

The others just nodded along with what Layla had said, they were going to stay on the island and protect the teleporter until their friends would return, so they could escape together.

"So does that mean we all stay here?" Logan asked.

Agent 11 raised his hand, but as quick as he did, Fex gave him a nudge.

"You don't get a say in this, as my puppet you'll have to come everywhere I go."

"I can't stay, guys." Mona shook her head. "I understand that you all care for each other, and truly I envy you for your camaraderie, but I didn't come here because of a higher calling. I came to repay a favour and I feel like I have done more than enough."

"I have cheated death twice already, so I don't wish to push my luck any further. Once they capture that Dragon, and believe me they will, it wouldn't surprise me if they destroy this island outright. If you're lucky they might come looking for us before that though."

"They shouldn't know anything about this teleportation yet, so they'll assume we're on the island. Your people might be here, but I have people waiting for me too."

The others agreed that it was unfair for them to ask Mona to stay. However, she was a strong ally for the group. Her staying behind would increase their chances of survival, but nobody felt it fair to ask that much of her.

"Can you at least take them?" Sam asked. "Please, take them back to the Cursed ship. Inform Megan and she will know what to do."

Mona looked at the large box that had Wevil's body inside, and Linda who had been placed on a few cushions that had been found in the room.

"It will be my pleasure." Mona replied. "I will leave Snakey and the Gorilla to the both of you to help out as much as possible. They seem to have grown a liking to your group. If possible, bring them back."

When the Roseus tree had been destroyed the Marking had naturally disappeared from the Gorilla, but due to how helpful it had been, Mona had decided to tame the beast with her ability and now it would follow any command or order she gave it.

Keeping to her promise, she strapped the large crate on her back, while holding Linda in her arms. The teleporter had been turned on and was set for the Cursed ship. Just before Mona was to step in she turned around to the group.

"Good luck to you all… make sure to come back alive! I'll treat you to something nice after this is all over."

With the rest having agreed to stay, everyone had decided to split up, to cover certain areas of the Temple. They mostly stayed on top of the roofs where the turrets had been set up. Sam and Logan remained in the teleporter room discussing what they had seen on the island, and everything said so far.

"I see, so it looks like they will successfully take the Dragon after all." Logan said. "It must be hard on everybody. They fought so hard, and we even lost Wevil. It will feel like they just wasted their time since there was no result."

"There is one thing that we have learned about the enemy, though." Sam replied, trying to look for some silver lining in the whole event. "We know that there are six spike Dalki's capable of destroying Demon tier beasts, and that's most likely what they will be using to take care of the Dragon as well. On top of that all the vampire clones."

When Sam said this out loud, Logan didn't say anything either, because they both knew, although they now possessed this information, they had no clue how it was going to help them. If anything it just made them realise how hopeless the situation was for humanity.

"What do you thin-"

"Don't ask a question you don't want the answer to." Logan cut Sam off before he could ask.

"Let me point out something that will give everyone hope. There is still a chance of us winning this thing. Even if they successfully get the Dragon, there is still one thing we can do to win the war." Logan stressed.

As to what that was, Sam had an idea but how likely would that happen.

------

Layla and Nate were both at the south gate of the Temple. This was the main entrance with an open pathway in front of the Temple. All the other sides were mostly blocked by the heavy jungle.

Nate had decided to meditate, hoping to recover as much of his Qi as possible. Layla acted as the lookout and spotted ruffling of trees in the distance and quickly drew her bow, ready to attack. When she finally saw who was coming out of the forest she put her bow back down, as a man drenched in blood from head to toe was seen, and he had a smile on his face.

Both of them seeing this, there was a shiver that had been sent down their spine, they were just happy that this one is on their side.

"I would put that bow back up if I were you." Raten called out, as he turned around again, acting like a gatekeeper. "They're coming for this place."

*****


# Chapter 1298 - The Six Spikes' Strength
Truth be told, Brock had no idea if he was going to survive the incoming attack from the six spiked Dalki. After it had survived his Blood attack he knew its hard skin was resilient, but he still had no idea about its own attack power.

Yet, the last person he would have ever suspected to arrive and stop the Dalki's advance, was the Wight.

"Damn, that's the first Dalki I've seen that hasn't been cut in half from Legs' attack." Peter noted as he stood there with two tonfa's out by his side. He was trying to observe the situation, and could see one six spiked fighting the old scientist, and another directly in front of him with another man behind.

"That tail… is that Slicer's body! What have you done to it?!" Jim seemed shocked, yet he seemed less fazed about having to fight her remains and more amazed by the sheer ingenuity at what he was seeing.

"Here I was wondering just how strong my little pets actually are. Thanks to you, I'll finally be able to test out their power compared to a genuine five spiked Dalki… or at least close enough to one!" Jim commented, having conjured a small little notebook and a pencil from a portal, while the six spike was on the move again.

Headless Hilston was the first one to make a move… The Lesser Wight looked different compared to before as his body was now equipped with a set of beast armour. It dug its fingers into the ground, and lifted part of it, chucking it forward.

The Dalki didn't even attempt to evade the piece of land that was coming its way and just ran through it, but right after crashing through the debris, Legs was there with its giant tail, thrusting it forward aiming right for the six spiked Dalki's head.

It moved so fast that the Dalki was unable to do anything about the tip of the tail piercing its left eye. However, before Legs could dig in any deeper the Dalki had grabbed onto its extremity.

It was ready to make its opponent pay for damaging its eye, but there were already three people surrounding it to back Legs up. Headless Hilston, Peter, and Brock were all underneath the creature and with all their strength they all went to attack the same area. The elbow of the Dalki.

Although they were unable to do anything on their own, together they could attempt to do something. Their great strength put massive amounts of pressure on the joint, causing the elbow to bend inward slightly, yet it wasn't enough for the Dalki to let go.

That moment Legs used the Dalki's strong grip to her own advantage, pulling herself in with the strong muscles of her tail and spinning her body towards the Dalki delivering a kick to the same joint… leading to a loud crack.

Pain shot through the Dalki's body enough to let go of the tail as it screamed out in pain. The others took that as their chance to retreat back to their original position, thinking about their next move. They were also prepared for the Dalki to move at any second once again.

'For a Wight to possess this level of intelligence… Usually their kind would just attack their target in a frontal and often suicidal manner, completely relying on their regeneration, but this boy waited long enough to see where I would attack first and then decided to attack the same place.' Brock noticed. 'It looks like he realises that I have a better head on my shoulders, and that Tail is special.'

'Perhaps, there is something different about the six spikes that are created using Jim's power, and the five spikes that the Cursed faction had managed to defeat on their own. Slicer's tail seems to be a trait that not all of the Dalki are able to obtain, not even the six spikes have something like it. It also can move faster than the six spikes and is capable of cutting through their hard scales.'

'Unfortunately, even with the power of all of us, we were unable to do much.'

Sure, the four of them together had managed to cause a few scratches on the Dalki's forearm, even breaking its elbow, but all of it was futile if they couldn't kill it. After a few seconds of both sides staring at each other, the Dalki was able to heal the broken elbow, and with it having been hurt more, most likely it was now even stronger than before.

'The worst thing is, we still haven't been able to witness its true strength, and I really don't want to after seeing one of them hit the Dragon to the ground like that.'

It was all these thoughts that had caused Brock to come to a decision. The way Peter currently was, he would be a huge asset to the future. With his ability, and with his current Lesser Wights he was someone he had to be protected at all costs.

"Thank you for saving me, but I'm afraid this doesn't look like a fight we're going to win." Brock sighed. "You are still valuable to the Cursed faction and Quinn, which is why I can't let you stay here. Get out of here while you still can and take the other two with you. Find Quinn and find some way to get you and all of the Cursed faction off this island!"

The Wight heard what Brock had said, and honestly he wasn't too keen to sacrifice his life for the two of them, but were they really in that tough of a situation? It was hard for Peter to believe. With him and his Lesser Wights they should be able to hold on, at least long enough for Quinn to arrive. With him there surely they should somehow be able to do something?

"The lapdog actually has a point. Until now I have mostly ignored the Cursed faction, because I didn't believe for your little group of friends to make much of a difference. The loss of Slicer was already a very unexpected surprise and seeing one of you being able to revive her, I can't just let you leave!" Jim held up the shield and strangely the six spiked Dalki that had been facing towards them this whole time had turned around and pulled back its arm… aiming at Jim!

The next second, they saw the Dalki seemingly use its full power to throw out a devastating punch and Jim made sure to use both his hands to hold the shield up. The punch landed but nothing happened. The shield hadn't lit up like it did when Brock had punched it, nor had Jim been sent flying through the air.

It looked similar to what would have happened if a child was to punch a wall.

"With this, your fate is sealed." Jim stated with a smile, holding up the shield and it soon started to glow just as before.

"PETER MOVE! GET OUT OF HERE NOW!" Brock shouted as he grabbed him by the scruff of his shirt and chucked him back into the jungle. The two Lesser Wights followed behind to catch their master and by the time Brock turned around, he was faced with the full brunt of an explosive energy.

The energy from the shield was already leaving a great blue light. As it left the shield and touched the stones on the floor they flew behind Brock like bullets shot from a pistol, piercing through many trees in the jungle.

The energy continued to go forward and Brock was sure that he wouldn't survive this.

'That shield, it can either store the energy from attacks inside it and use it against, or it's something much worse. When I attacked it myself, I felt that the energy coming off from the shield was at least two times stronger than my initial attack. If that's right, then right now, that shield is emptying a strike twice as strong as a six spiked Dalki.'

Somewhat accepting what his fate was to be, Brock was ready to close his eyes. Peter had turned around for a second, and seeing the impact the strange blue light had made so far, he continued to run forward with Legs and Hilston behind him.

Before Brock had fully closed his eyes, he saw another figure in front of him.

"As you said Brock, me and you will figure out some way to deal with this. It was a good decision you made." Richard said as the red ripples activated form his armour blocking the strange energy of the attack.

However, the attack seemed to be larger than the area that the red ripples could cover. Larger than the breath of the Demon tier dragon beast, it went around the red ripples. As it touched the trees they were uprooted from the ground, and flung through the air.

Giant rocks had been turned to rubble, and. Small little hill that stood not too far from where they were had been blasted with parts of the rock falling into the sea.

Eventually, the attack had ended, and Jim had moved his shield. His eyebrows were furrowed and his forehead full of wrinkles in anger seeing that Richard had managed to get in his way once again, but behind him, the whole jungle had been cleared. The once lush vegetation was nothing but a soil of wasteland now, while part of the hill looked to be missing as well.

"Why do you all struggle so much? How can you not understand that you have no chance against me? This much was all from a single punch of one Dalki?" Jim questioned one, shaking his head.

Richard, serving the attack with Brock behind him, looked into the direction he just was.

"I understand very well. Your six spiked Dalki are indeed strong, but for one there is nothing that can get through this armour, and as for the second point. When using our ability there is always an exchange and I seem to have figured out just what price you have made them pay."

Over to the side where Richard was fighting not too long ago, the six spiked Dalki laid on the floor dead. However, strangely, other than its cut hands, it looked to have no visible wounds on its body, but it was clearly no longer moving.

# Chapter 1299 - An Old Enemy
Finally, after what seemed like endless fighting to Quinn, he could tell that the Masked were starting to settle down. More so, he also noticed that none of the other Cursed faction members seemed to be in trouble. For now at least, which was why Quinn was able to continue thinning their numbers while strengthening himself.

He checked his status which now displayed.

[2643 MC cells]

'Fighting all of these Masked hasn't been too bad for me. Not only was I able to increase my maximum MC cells, but also recover some of my MC points so I can use my shadows to fight again. After gaining some of my MC points back, using the dome to speed up my recovery and fight the rest of them was a good idea.' Quinn thought to himself.

After learning that those Masked were merely clones of Jim, Quinn felt a lot more at ease killing them, and during his little massacre he had also discovered a few other things about the Masked.

For one, none of the Masked seemed to have a blood crystal inside of them, despite them clearly being vampires… Quinn had asked Vincent about this, but unfortunately the other had never been able to successfully clone one, so he lacked the necessary knowledge to be able to answer him.

Nevertheless, that didn't stop the Masked from using their Blood powers, so the best explanation Vincent had on that matter was that it might have been one of the drawbacks of the clones, potentially even the very reason why clones didn't really enjoy a long life expectancy.

Regardless of this, Quinn was happy to use the clones to increase his MC cells, allowing him to block stronger attacks with his shadow, gain more shadows to fight with and lastly use the Shadow Overload skill for a longer period of time.

It was then, when the Masked that had surrounded Quinn were down to the last thirty, that they had stopped engaging him, rather they remained on their place. This approach made it seem as if they were buying time for something.

It was at that moment, once again Quinn could feel the ground slightly vibrating. His ears were the first to catch the loud noise and the next second he could see a large beam of blue light off in the distance.

When the Dragon had been attacked it had come from behind Quinn, yet this new attack had come from his front, which was why the Cursed faction leader was heading there.

'Damn it, it looks like I might have wasted too much time on you guys!' Quinn thought, no longer caring about using the Shadow eater to improve his MC cells marginally and instead went to finish them all off quickly instead.

And then finally there was only one. This one felt different to the rest of the Masked, as he was shaking and Quinn had left this one on its own on purpose. Quinn took a step forward, and immediately hit both of the hands that had been raised in order to defend the masked man.

"I knew from the beginning of the fight that you were different. I'm surprised you didn't run away until this point." Quinn said as he lifted his hand pulling the mask off from the person's face and threw it on the floor, quickly stomping on it breaking it to pieces.

The person behind the mask had tears already running down their face, and for once it wasn't Jim's face that greeted him like all of those others he had unmasked.

"Please don't kill me, we were forced to come here, We were told to fight! Otherwise if we didn't we would be killed!" It looked like a fairly young man, older than Quinn himself in his late twenties.

Seeing this, there was something bothering him, why would the humans be working with Jim in the first place.

"Tell me who you are. What do you know about the person you are working for and why are you here?" Quinn asked, since the person already seemed to be willing to speak, Quinn didn't feel the need to use the Influence skill at all. Especially since he was pressed for time.

Often, the influence skill would be more direct with extracting information from one, causing Quinn to ask multiple questions.

"T-truedream! Y-you must have heard of our family name before, right?" The man stuttered slightly in fear. "No I'm sure you have, we, the humans, all of us here are those that used to belong to the Truedream family! "

Hearing this, Quinn was so surprised that he almost dropped the person to the ground, but another voice soon snapped him out of it.

"What did you say?" Vorden asked from behind. "I thought the Blades were the ones that had gotten rid of the Truedream family? Didn't they retaliate after attacking?"

Quinn still hadn't yet recovered from the shock of the news, as he saw Vorden here but at the same time he too was interested in what the person had to say.

"It's true, we were attacked by the Blade family. However, a few of us had managed to escape back to Dreamland city, but what surprised Trudream, and the rest of us, was that while we were away another group had attacked us as well, they captured Jack and the rest of us."

Quinn had a feeling that Truedream was still alive, but for him to also be working for the other side was not what he had expected, just what Jim was planning to do with him.

It was then while in the middle of these thoughts, Quinn had also ran into Peter, and his two Lesser Wights, from the part of the jungle that was still left.

"Whoa, I mean I thought I had killed a lot, but Quinn what did you do?" Peter asked as he went through a field full of dead bodies.

Quinn didn't really know what to do with the person from Truedream but thought that they could perhaps get more answers from him about Jim, and maybe more details about where they were or what they were planning.

In the meantime, the rest had told Quinn what they needed, Vorden had informed him of what the rest of the Cursed faction were doing, and Peter had updated what was happening with Eno and Richard.

"A six spiked Dalki?" Quinn questioned, having trouble believing it. He clenched his fist, trying to think about what he could do against one, if he had already been powerless in front of Slicer without the help of the Blades. How would he fare against the six spike?

"Quinn, I think it's obvious that we won't be able to fight them on our own. With that kind of power they might really succeed in taking the Dragon. There's no point in us staying here, so let's head back and regroup at the Cursed faction ship. Maybe we can figure out something else. Hunt more Demon tier beasts, get better equipment and fight them later." Vorden suggested.

Honestly, Vorden when coming here didn't think he needed to do much convincing to the two of them, he thought it was clear that this whole mission had been one giant failure, but there was a certain look in Quinn's eye that said he wasn't planning to go back.

'Quinn, I don't like asking you for so many favours, but I think there might be something I can do. Take me to Jim, let me speak to him.' Vincent requested.

After thinking about it for a while, and with the little push from Vincent, Quinn had made his decision.

"I think there is still something I can do… no, that I have to do. Don't worry about me, with the Shadow ability, I can travel to one of you even without the teleporter. Take Peter and this guy with you, I believe he might have some more information for us."

The man looked like he was about to complain, but then staring at the dead bodies on the field, he quickly shut his mouth, realising that he was still lucky to be alive. Who cared who he used to work for, he just wanted to live.

"Don't worry, I'm not going to risk my life for Eno. You all know how much I dislike him, but if I can bring him back with us… I still think he might be able to help us with Arthur as well. And…They have dealt a big blow to us, while we still haven't dealt a big blow to them. I can't just leave them like that."

The two of them understood, and it looked like they also wanted to stay with Quinn, that was until Quinn could feel a connection inside him once again.

"The others, they're under attack!" Quinn called out. "The rest of the Masked must be attacking the guys at the temple. Please hurry up, they will need your help! Head back to the Cursed ship, it's an order!"

The two of them looked at Quinn for a few seconds, before they started to head off in the other direction.

"Vorden!' Quinn shouted out, just before he fully left. "Who was it?"

From just this much, Vorden knew what Quinn wanted to know.

"…It was Wevil."

"I will make them pay for taking his life!"
