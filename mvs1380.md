# Chapter 1380 - Double Quinn
While waiting for Shiro to arrive, Quinn was busy inspecting his other self floating inside the glass container. It was a different experience than looking into a mirror, where one couldn't really imagine how they looked through other eyes, he was actually seeing another version of himself.

'So this is how people see me huh?' Quinn stared hard at certain details of his body, in particular he was admiring his face. He hadn't actually been looking in a mirror much and after each evolution his body changed significantly.

"Not to toot my own horn, but I guess I am quite handsome. Looks like you're in luck Vincent." Quinn said out loud. A couple of chuckles were heard from behind, and when Quinn turned he could see Linda, and Shiro there. He could feel his cheeks heating up by the second.

"Don't be shy Quinn. Honestly you're right, with your looks you can make anyone blush. If it wasn't for your position I'm sure you would have more than just those that were chasing after you already." Linda teased him.

Quinn didn't doubt her. The Vampire Lord had turned off his Charm ever since he had tested it out and the reporter Bonny had practically stolen his first kiss.

'My Charm is at a 100 now, I wonder what would happen if I opened it up again?' Quinn thought to himself. Perhaps he would test it one day, but not in front of people he knew like Linda, that would be a little too awkward.

"I see all the pieces are here now." Logan spoke up, stepping forward as it was time for them all to get to work. The body was removed from the glass container full of liquid and was placed out onto what looked like a medical table. Now that they could see it in the flesh, the light around its chest became more visible.

"Are you sure there isn't a consciousness already present inside this body?" Quinn asked to make sure.

"It was made from scratch and I can guarantee you that it's brain dead. I didn't want to put that weight on your shoulders." Logan answered immediately. The question that was on all of their minds though, was just who did Quinn want to use the body for.

There were three beds laid out. Logan had made sure to make this experience as comfortable as possible. They looked like soft hospital beds, and Quinn wondered where and when he had got them from, or if he had just made them himself,

Shiro was placed in the middle, while the clone and Quinn were on either side lying down.

"You said this clone can live forever, but unlike Eno's and Jim's it can also learn abilities, right? What else do we know about it?" Quinn questioned, as he got into position.

"I'm not sure. My knowledge about this subject stems from Eno's research and he had only been able to theorise about this process. By my predictions it should be identical to you, almost like another Peter. However, as for abilities, we will have to see, but I wouldn't be too hopeful. I haven't managed to figure that part out and neither have the others." Logan replied, and headed towards Shiro. "When you're ready, hold Quinn's hand and the other one."

For some reason, Shiro felt more nervous than the previous times. He had already done this a few times now, so it should be a walk in the park, but perhaps it was due to who he was helping out this time. He didn't want to let Quinn down.

'Not again, not after I failed to bring Oscar back… I will make it work this time!' He hyped himself up.

Logan, and Linda stood by the computer, which was checking their vitals, brain activity and more. They didn't know what went on when Shiro used his ability, and honestly, Linda had no clue what all the symbols and signs on the screen meant.

After a few minutes though, one of the screens that had shown nothing was finally active.

"It looks like it was a success. I guess we finally get to meet the person who took over Quinn's body whenever he used that Demon tier Amulet, and if my guess is right, it's the one that created his system."

"System?" Linda repeated overhearing Logan.

Logan was one of the few people that actually knew Quinn had a system due to his own ability and his family's involvement in helping create it in the first place.

Slowly all three of them got up from the bed, Shiro touching his head, feeling a bit weak because he had used his ability quite a bit. He smiled though looking over at the others who had gotten up as well.

The clone was touching his body all over, from head to toe moving around.

"You… you did it! I'm in my own body. Well…A body. I have control again." Vincent announced.

Using the clone's body wasn't too hard for Vincent. He had already gotten used to moving around in Quinn's body when the two of them had gone through training together. This one didn't feel too different compared to it.

"I can finally, actually see you." Quinn said, but saying those words to himself was a little strange.

Still he pushed through. "Thank you Vincent, thank you for all the help you have given me. There were so many times when I was lost and you put me on the right path.

"Honestly, I can't even imagine some of the decisions I would have made without you or what would've happened if I didn't have you. This was one of the main reasons why I wanted you out of that system, so I could actually see you in person."

The others didn't quite understand what was happening, but thought it was best to let them have their intimate moment with each other. That was when they could see the clone Quinn opening up his arms.

"Come here, I've been waiting to do this for a while. Watching you grow up was like looking after another son!" Vincent stated. Although it was embarrassing, how could he turn down an offer like that from Vincent? Quinn went in for the hug.

"It's like seeing two hot twins hugging. This is really weird and somehow feels wrong. Sorry, I just had to get that out." Linda commented, making the others break into laughter.

A little while after they caught up, some clothes and armour had been given to Vincent from Quinn's dimensional space. He had prepared some things, but still kept the Blood set and the Blue Fang set for himself.

After that, everyone decided to head outside, into the inner castle area. The place was empty, since there were no longer any family members.

It was a wasted space for now, making Quinn think that maybe there was a better use for it later.

Right now though, he wanted to test Vincent's abilities and what it was able to do. They began with an easy strength test by holding a simple arm wrestling match. Not holding back they both used all their strength, though Quinn abstained from using his Qi or anything else to support him, making the two of them dead even.

There were then a few light spars between the two, and this was where the difference in their fighting styles showed, as Vincent fought in a completely different way to Quinn. Lastly, there was the test of Blood powers. Vincent was able to use his Blood powers, but they were not on the same level as Quinn.

"Well the good news is my system is intact. Everything is working fine, there seems to be no changes." Quinn shared.

"For me, your body is actually better than mine, but your Blood powers are lacking compared to what I had, I guess most of what you have now is due to the Absolute Blood Control." Vincent replied.

The last test they held was to check if Vincent could learn an ability or not, but this one was a hard one to do, and Vincent wanted to head back to the castle to try and take his time re-learning the Equivalent Exchange ability to see if he could.

However, based on how he was feeling at the moment, it was unlikely even with his new special body.

"I guess, unlike Peter who gets stronger based on you, I will not, so it's best for me to treat this body as my own. I should be able to improve its Blood control to a good standard soon." Vincent explained.

"That's good, which means you will be a match for the other leaders as well. Now we just need to somehow explain this to them, without having them freak out. Let's head back to the castle, and change what you look like, it's starting to creep even me out a little." Quinn half-joked.

The group had decided to do just that, and Logan took all his new knowledge with him. He would have preferred to test several more things with the Nest Crystal. It was a shame that something like this had to be done, but in the future perhaps he could.

When they arrived at the castle, Vincent was busy familiarizing himself with his very old home, at the same time Quinn had called a certain someone. He needed to speak to them about something since Vincent wasn't the only thing that he had to tell the leaders about.

"Yo, yo, yo!" Fex said, walking into the throne room with a hop in his step.

"You seem happy?" Quinn said.

"Why wouldn't I be, my Blood brother is the King, and I'm his friend. Like you literally don't understand how big this is!" Fex explained, coming over to him like he was about to throw his arm over his head like he usually would do but then stopped himself.

His vampire side was kicking in.

"Please, don't treat me any differently, I actually called you over because I wanted to ask you something. What do you think about becoming one of my Royal Knights?" Quinn asked.

*****

# Chapter 1381 - Much Change
Fex was at a loss for words. He literally had his mouth open wide and had no clue what to say as he looked at Quinn. He was trying to see some sign, to see if he was joking or not, but it didn't seem to be the case at all.

"Wait Quinn, I know you weren't a vampire, so maybe you don't know, but not just anyone can become a Royal Knight!" Fex tried to explain. "The Royal Knights are selected from the leaders. The Kings' left and right-hand men. I'm not a leader, and I'm not even a knight. Don't you remember I was also banished from my own family!"

Quinn nodded along and placed his hand on Fex's shoulder. Hoping that it would calm him in some way.

"I do know, but that was under the old rule. Look, me becoming King, it wasn't exactly due to regular circumstances, and think of it this way. You were so loyal to me that you were even about to be executed, for my sake.

"I can't think of someone better than you. Perhaps the vampires could argue somewhat if I had chosen someone that I turned, but I won't back down from this. Unless you have a good reason to refuse, I intend to make you my Royal Knight."

It was something Fex never imagined. Becoming a Royal Knight was a top honour. It was even above becoming a leader of a family. If the King asked you to be his knight, they would have to leave their position and accept, and now knowing Quinn was serious, almost immediately, Fex got down on one knee.

"I, Fex Sanguinis, pledge my loyalty to King, Quinn Talen of the tenth family. I will do everything in my power until my last breath to help you!" Fex yelled at the top of his lungs, and a few seconds later, tears started to fall from his face.

Quinn didn't quite understand why Fex was acting like this. He thought he would be happy, or maybe even annoyed that he had 'made' him do such a thing. As for the new Royal Knight, the reason for his happiness was because his life had been changed at this moment.

There were times while Fex was in the tenth family that he thought he could never rise to a higher position, that maybe his family members would look down on him. He also didn't like how he had ruined his family's reputation, but this single gesture from Quinn would restore it all again.

As soon as Fex had accepted the role, Quinn saw an adjustment in his system. He saw that now he could also summon Fex using the Summon skill whenever he wished.

'That's quite handy to have. Maybe I should make someone from the Cursed faction my Royal Knight after all. The Summon skill can be used as a protection as well as a helpful tool for myself.' Quinn thought.

Another interesting thing Quinn noticed was that it didn't matter if the council had accepted Fex or not. It seemed like his system had already agreed. Which was a different matter for someone else.

"Actually, Quinn, I know it might not be my place to speak about this, but I wanted to suggest something…" Fex said.

Fex talked about the suggestion he wanted to make, and Quinn thought it was a good idea.

"That great, I'll call a meeting now, and we can meet in the new castle together. We can make that announcement now."

A gulping sound was heard, as Fex didn't realise that things would be moving so quickly. He should have realised that when Quinn said he was going to do things, he meant it.

The two of them began to walk around the castle, and he had already asked Timmy to contact the other leaders and tell them all to meet in the new council room. That it was an order from the King.

In the meantime, Fex wondered what they were still doing in the tenth castle and eventually found themselves heading to the lab in the castle. A place where Logan would usually be. When entering, Fex could see the back of someone he didn't quite recognise, and as soon as he turned around, his mouth was left wide open, and he was at a loss for words for the second time today.

"But… he's…you…you…" Fex continually looked back and forth at the two people, not entirely understanding what was going on. There was an identical copy of Quinn…almost. There was one change and it was the hairstyle.

While Quinn now had his shortened hair and spiked it up a little bit, Vincent had decided to put his fringe down and to the side.

"Is it a transformation ability?' Fex asked.

"Almost, that's the new tenth leader of the castle…I guess I should explain a few things to you while we are at the King's castle." Quinn said, patting him on the back.

While on the walk, Quinn explained that he had found Vincent, one of the old tenth leaders, conciseness deep within him. It was left with him through a book. There is no point for Quinn to explain the part about the system, but he thought this was close enough to the truth in the first place.

The consciousness that was always with him was why Quinn had knowledge about the vampire world, even though he had never been there before.

When arriving at the new Royale castle, Fex was surprised to see that there had been some changes inside as well as outside. This was all due to Quinn. He not only had rebuilt it, but the system had also influenced it to suit more of his style. Modernising the hallways.

Although, it did make everything look a bit plain, boring and white. It wasn't to Fex's liking at all. Eventually, they had reached the council room. Upon entering, he had both Vincent, and Fex by his side, and all of the leaders were already present in the room.

The leaders stood up and bowed, but they couldn't help but stare at the person who was by his side, who resembled Quinn greatly.

"If you would like, I could do the honours of taking over the meeting," Vincent said. "I have been to many of these things in the past after all."

Quinn nodded because even though he had attended meetings like this before, it really wasn't something he was used to as a king.

"Alright, everyone here. Today our majesty has a few things that he would like to announce and discuss with you all. Listen to what he has to say." Vincent said and folded his arms, having completed what he wanted to say.

Seeing how informal he spoke to the leaders and their angry expressions, Quinn didn't think he had done a good job and might have worsened matters.

'I guess Vincent disliked this whole system nearly as much as I did.' Quinn thought sitting down, in his seat while the two continued to stand by his side.

"First, I would like to announce to you all that I have selected the new leader for the tenth family. His name is Vincent Eno."

Some of the leaders twitched slightly hearing that name, wondering why it sounded familiar, but the first name Vincent wasn't too uncommon, so they decided to ignore it.

"As you can see, I and Vincent look quite similar, and that's because we are. Right now, he is using a body that is identical to mine. This is also true in terms of strength as well. If any of you wish to test him, then feel free to do so.

"My reason for selecting Vincent is because he is a knowledgeable vampire from our family. I also don't plan to hide anything from you all. He is the ex-leader, who at one point and time, escaped from this settlement.

"Why am I telling you this? Because I don't want any of you to complain when you find out later or have decided to do some digging. Anyway, Vincent has great knowledge and is someone who looks after people. Are there any objections?" Quinn asked.

The room was silent for a while until Sunny was the first to speak.

"Vincent Eno…it has been a while, hasn't it." She said, looking at him. "Your majesty, I don't know how much you know about the tenth people's past, but…there are many vampires that hated Vincent because he left them. He was the reason why your family-"

"And most of them are dead," Quinn replied. "Do you not remember, most of the tenth family inner castle members had been killed, including Edward, who was most loyal to Vincent in an attack. An attack by the second family. Now the tenth family is full of Pooling vampires who don't know better, and most of my own people from earth apart from a few students here and there."

Since Quinn had quickly shut down Sunny and reminded them how the tenth family had lost a lot, none of them said anything further.

"And finally, I have selected my new Royal knight."

The other leaders sat up more straight, and it looked like Muka was ready to move from his seat, but that's when they could all see that Quinn was pointing to someone by his side.

Smiling, Fex waved at them all, nervous.

"This is…this is too much," Jake said. Too many changes were happening in the settlement, and they were happening far too fast.

"Now, before you all jump the gun, there is a good reason why I have selected Fex as the Royal knight. Why don't you show them." Quinn said.

Nervously, Fex looked at them all. He closed his eyes, concentrating, trying to form it as he always did. A glow started to appear from his chest, and a large single black needle was revealed.

"What I have here is what is known as an Inner Blood weapon, and as the Royal knight, I wish to teach all vampires this skill!" Fex almost shouted.

*******

# Chapter 1382 - Making An Entrance
At a glance, the leaders could tell that what had been summoned was indeed a Blood weapon. The question was, how was Fex able to do such a thing. They had seen him pull it out of nowhere, and only a small glow appeared from his chest.

The name Inner would suggest that it had come from inside him, but they all just wondered how. Still, one family already knew the answer to this, and they wondered what exactly the new king was planning to do.

"This here is something that will change the vampires' lives," Quinn said. "I know that creating blood weapons is banned. This was because you didn't wish for vampires to kill each other just for the pursuit of stronger weapons, but these blood weapons belong to you in the first place.

"Created from the crystal inside your body. I think it's essential that we teach all of the vampires this skill. It will be a boost in their strength. I don't know if you realised, but the Dalki blood acts similar to human blood no…it actually is even better than human blood. The inner blood weapons when fighting against them will be our biggest asset.

"This is one of the many reasons why I think Fex deserves to be a Royal Knight. The information was discovered by himself, with a pursuit of getting stronger. He had no time to inform all of you since things have been hectic since we arrived. He will be passing on knowledge that not only improves his family lives but all of the settlement. He is loyal to me and originally not from the tenth family."

Some of the leaders initially wanted to dispute Fex becoming his vampire knight, but this discovery was too significant for them all. They wondered if Fex didn't become a Royal knight if he would still share these skills. It was almost as if Quinn was stating, this is why you can't disagree with my decision. And with how close he was to the king, they sure couldn't force this information out of him.

There seemed to be no objections, and looking around, Fex could just see the biggest smile he had ever seen on his fathers face. Seeing that made it one of the happiest moments in Fex's life. A moment that he would treasure forever.

"Can we ask, what about the second Royal knight position, and have you decided what to do with the Royal guards?" Jim asked.

"Guards?" Quinn replied, knowing that this question would come up. "I believe there is no longer a need for Royal guards. As I stated with my condition before, we will be working to save the humans. I have the whole Cursed faction and trustworthy people there that will be willing to help me. The guards were originally vampires loyal to the king, so they will feel the same to me.

"If I was even to take members from other families, there is no telling if they would even be loyal to me. It makes no sense in my eyes."

For a lot of leaders, they didn't mind this, for they didn't want to weaken their own power. The guards were vampires meant to be at knight level, so they would be giving away their most potential candidates just for someone else to use.

After figuring out that Quinn could also use his summon skill on Royal guards, he wanted to make use of it with one of his own people. Perhaps someone like Layla, but at the end of the day, this relationship needed to be two ways.

Quinn had already been pushing and pushing the vampires. Perhaps he could get away with everything he wanted, but that would just leave a bad taste in the other leaders' mouths, more likely to cause a problem in the future.

"Muka," Quinn said. "Honestly, I feel like he has always cared about this settlement. Trying to figure out what was happening before anyone else did. Even if I was to do wrong, I know he would try and figure out a way to get rid of me.

"Honestly, I don't see that as a bad thing, as long as he accepts, of course."

In an instant, Muka stood up from his seat and bowed down.

"Yes, your majesty."

If one was to look at him, it would be hard to tell whether or not he was happy about this due to the fact he always had a helmet on his face, but they could tell he was delighted. However, at that moment, he did something that was more shocking.

Placing both hands on the top of his head, he lifted up his helmet, revealing his face. Which simply stunned the leaders.

"Oh…have I been wrong this whole time. I'm sorry." Quinn quickly apologised.

"You're a…a girl!" Fex shouted what everyone was thinking. "But I thought you were a guy. Everyone thought you were a guy. Why didn't you correct us when we call you he?"

Long flowing back hair could be seen going along the back of her armour, and a perfect, almost egg-shaped face could be seen. All the leaders were stunned by her beauty and couldn't stop staring, including Sunny.

Quickly noticing this, Muka placed the helmet back on her head.

"Ah, I feel much more comfortable with the helmet back on. I thought at least your majesty should know what the person who was selected as your knight knows what I look like."

"But I don't understand when we were younger. I was sure you had short hair and your face." Sunny continued to say.

"I was just a kid back then," Muka replied. "The short hair was just less troublesome to deal with, and you think my father would really let me play with boys around that age. It was why I frequently visited you."

Seeing how the focus of the meeting was starting to move, Muka herself thought it was best if she kept them all on track and clapped her hand once to silence everyone.

"I believe his majesty still has more to say."

At this moment, Vincent was getting a little tired of standing and decided to walk over and sit down in the tenth's seat. He didn't ask Quinn, nor did he greet the others on his way down.

"Please, what are you all looking at?" Vincent asked.

"Forgive us," David spoke. "But it will certainly take some getting used to. Having you returned after all these years. I hope that we could actually have a little catch-up."

The truth was that Vincent didn't have a bad relationship with many leaders before he left, which was why his sudden actions hurt them even more. Still, Vincent, on the other hand, did have.

They had sent counterless vampires after him and his family members for years after leaving the settlement.

"Sure, but let's hear what the king has to say first." Vincent replied.

Thankfully, Quinn started to speak again.

"You all know that my goal is to help the humans in this war to join them. I wish for all of you to learn how to use your inner blood weapons before we go out. When I say this, I am referring to the leaders.

"I expect that since you are leaders, you should be talented and learn this before all the others. Once we have learnt this, then the rest of the leaders and I will make our first move."

"Only us?" Jake asked.

"Yes," Quinn replied. "At the moment, the human race is cautious against vampires. They had learnt of our existence, but at the time, there were Jim's clones as well as the vampire spies that had been taken over. They have already been hurt by vampires.

"If we were to turn up, it would make things difficult, which is why I decided that we would need a special type of entrance. I plan to move the settlement, eventually into the beast planet solar system, but we need a safe planet to do that. I will be the first to move, and then I will bring you all with me later.

We need to show the whole world our power and just how much we can help in this war, and that's where we all will come in." Quinn smiled.

*****

# Chapter 1383 - The Leaders Growth (Part 1)
It wasn't long after the meeting, that an announcement was made to the whole settlement about the King's two new Royal Knights. There was no big ceremony, Quinn had felt like they had had enough of those recently.

Every time they had a ceremony it seemed to delay things. He didn't understand what all the big huff was about, but according to Vincent, when vampires had lived for 1000s of years and had done nearly everything, an excuse for a celebration or something for them to do was welcomed.

He still disregarded this fact because now they did have something important to do, and thought it was just best to deliver the news to the leaders, allowing them to pass on the message. Although none of the vampires disagreed with Quinn's decision to make Muka a Royal knight, they considered him a good choice…her a good choice. They did though, wonder why someone like Fex had been chosen.

In the end, the people believed that it was due to him being close to the King. There were those vampires, who believed their leaders should have rightfully obtained the position and complained a little, yet the ones in the pooling area were okay with this. It seemed like the inner castle vampires were the ones kicking up the most fuss.

The Pooling vampires were still over the moon that Quinn had accepted to be their King in the first place, and they thought whoever he selected for the positions were the right choice. They just saw his actions through rose-colored glasses, where whatever he did couldn't be seen as wrong to them.

Then, there was a more tricky announcement, and it was for the tenth family. For this one, Quinn did decide to gather the people, because he wanted to gauge their initial reaction. Just like with the leaders, he didn't want to hide anything from his people as well.

They stopped on top of a balcony that led out from the castle, and all the vampires belonging to the tenth family were invited. They stood outside looking upward. As Quinn came out the usual roar and cheers were heard, and then when Vincent was revealed there were audible gasps in the crowd.

"Is it his twin? The tenth leader had a twin we never knew about?!"

"It must just be someone with an ability, right?"

In the end, Quinn decided it was best for him to speak first.

"As you all know, I have taken up the role to be your King, which means in my place someone else will have to take care of the tenth family. Leo will continue to be your Knight, as for the other position, I will be leaving that decision to my successor, although it might be more accurate to call him my predecessor.

"Due to some special circumstances we have provided him with a new body." Quinn explained. "This here is Vincent Eno, the former leader of the tenth family."

There was whispering from the crowd, even if most of the vampires weren't around when Vincent had been their leader, they still knew the tenth family's history and he had been branded a traitor as a leader that had abandoned them at a crucial time, making the other families treat them like scum.

"Boo boo!"

There was great negativity from the crowd at the mention of that name, and Quinn was worried that any second the people might start to chuck things at them.

"Do you want me to say a few things to them?" Vincent asked. "They have a right to be upset."

"No!" Quinn quickly said, remembering what had happened when he had chosen to speak during that council meeting. It was one thing for the other leaders to dislike him, but for the ones he was supposed to lead would be a disaster.

"Everyone quite!" Quinn yelled, amplifying his voice with Qi. "I know of Vincent's past, in fact his blood runs through my veins, but you also don't know what he has been doing while he was away.

"It was because of Vincent that I was able to become who I am today! He guided me, taught me how to use my Blood powers and more. He was even the one that asked me to help you all! If it wasn't for him, then you wouldn't have me here today either!"

The vampires didn't know if these words were true, but what seemed to somewhat convince them, was the fact that Vincent now looked identical to Quinn. They couldn't imagine what he had been through that would make it so he had to be that way.

"In the end, if you are not happy with this decision, then I ask you to blame me who made this decision!" Quinn demanded.

It was then, a few seconds later that the crowd started to cheer, although it wasn't as joyous or as loud as they had done in the past, and seemed to be more done of obligations than true feelings.

"It looks like you have a lot to make up for, Vincent. Maybe try to be a good leader for them in this lifetime." Quinn advised. "And put some thought into picking your next knight."

There were a few choices that Quinn had in mind, such as Timmy, who had Edwards power and knowledge, Xander who had potential to grow stronger every time he saw him and lastly Ashley, Who worked closest under Paul. He was also a bright talent that was improving quicker than most.

Still, it just felt right to leave it up to Vincent, since they would technically be working under him, while Vincent would work for Quinn.

"I wasn't a bad leader in the first place.'' Vincent sighed. "They just forgot everything I did for them before I left. It only takes one bad thing to make others forget about all the good you have done beforehand…"

———

All of the leaders had been called to the 8th inner castle area. After thinking about how to use it for a while Quinn had come up with an idea. The King wanted to use the empty area as a training ground. The leaders having strong powers would cause destruction wherever they trained and that included their own castles.

In an area like this, that wouldn't matter though. The area had changed somewhat since the leaders had last come here, and they couldn't help but stare at the empty space and the large platforms that had been created.

"How were you able to do this so fast?" Sunny asked.

"The same way I improved the settlement. I can control everything as I wish, take down buildings, move things and create new structures, it's pretty amazing, right?" Quinn grinned, but soon blushed as he realised that it made it sound as if even he himself was amazed by his own skills. Of course he was, because he still couldn't believe what the system allowed him to do, but he understood that as a good King he was supposed to appear calm and dignified,

The leaders stood on top of one of the large platforms. By Quinn's side were Muka and Fex. He would have liked Vincent by his side as well, but he thought that would appear as clear favoritism, so his ancestor was currently standing amongst the other leaders.

"Alright, so from now on, we are going to use this area to train. You don't need to tell me how useless you all were against Laxmus. Use this chance to learn so that you can repay him yourself for everything he had done to the vampire settlement!" Quinn shouted.

It was strange for the leaders to hear these words. They were the strongest vampires in the settlement, and they had hardly ever heard themselves being called useless, but compared to Quinn they truly did feel that way.

"You guys need to get better or stronger at fighting, This whole time a lot of you have been lazy. So there will be two things we are focusing on. One Fex will show you all how to summon your inner blood weapon, and two I want the leaders to fight against each other and improve, and I want you to especially go hard, against Vincent." Quinn grinned.

*****

# Chapter 1384 - The Leaders' Growth (Part 2)
The leaders looked pleased about Quinn's remark, and it was for more reasons than one. Vincent hadn't given them respect. Some of the leaders, such as Lee, Sunny, Jin and so on were leaders even when Vincent was around.

Yet, he treated them as if they were young upstarts, but for the other leaders they were excited for a different reason. There were those like Nicu that disliked Quinn, and this was a chance to pound the face of someone who looked exactly like him, but would be far weaker.

"It seems like you were all holding back, too afraid to reveal your full strength, worried about infighting. Well, now we all have a common enemy, so let's grow stronger together instead of worrying about individual families!" Quinn said.

The leaders agreed, and Fex was put to work immediately. He went into the explanation to them all about the Inner Blood weapon. It was a struggle since Fex wasn't the best person at explaining such things. After practising for a while, the leaders found little success. Lee had to pretend that he no didn't know about the Blood weapon, afraid he would get his son into some type of trouble.

There was also another Quinn was keeping an eye on, and that was Vincent. Although he could use blood abilities, Quinn was unsure if he would have an inner blood weapon as well. Since he wasn't exactly human.

After no results were given, and since they couldn't stay doing the same thing forever, it was time to go onto the sparring section.

The younger leaders were more willing to test their powers against each other. In contrast, the older ones were still reserved in showing off their strength, but what was surprising was Vincent. With his new body, he was easily able to overpower most of the vampires despite still lacking an actual ability.

Then there was Vincent.

"Remind me why I'm the only one going up against two at once?" Vincent asked.

"These two are new leaders, so you should be able to handle this, besides. My body isn't that weak!" Quinn shouted back.

The leaders were Nicu and Katori. Their abilities hadn't fully developed, and they had next to no experience fighting, but they had the potential to be just as strong as the leaders before them.

However, during the fight, that didn't seem to be the case, Vincent was able to dodge all the sword strikes with ease, and with a single hit to Nicu in the stomach, it looked like he wouldn't be getting up for a long time. Then, with a kick to Katori's side, the results were quite similar.

It didn't matter if Vincent was weaker than them at blood control, when he would never be fighting them in a match with blood in the first place. With the beast armour and stats like Quinn, most leaders just couldn't do anything.

"Could you not go a bit easier on them? If it's too one-sided, then this isn't exactly training!" Quinn yelled.

"Wait, so they can go as hard as they want against me, but I can't do the same to them!" Vincent argued back.

It was because of this that Vincent's opponents needed to change. When going up against the more experienced battles, it seemed to be harder for Vicnent, mainly due to abilities. Since Vincent didn't have any himself, and they knew what his strengths were, they were being cautious.

This was exactly what Quinn wanted so they could all improve together.

"Watching all this fighting makes me want to spar a bit."

"Please don't your majesty," Muka replied. "We would have to all go up against you together if you were to get anything out of it."

Muka quickly realised the mistake that she had made. She might have just given him a horrible idea, so she decided it was best for her to continue giving her report.

"The family that accepted your request to send out a force was the fourth family, Jin Talon. His ability is strong in attacking, and he thought that it would be easy when using his power to try to help you find a Nest Crystal."

Quinn thought so as well. Exploding blood was one of the more difficult abilities Quinn had dealt with out of all of the leaders. There was another reason why Quinn was watching them all, and that was because he wanted to grant all the leaders with weapons.

They didn't have the habit of relying on beast or blood weapons, but it would increase their strength exponentially if they would start to use them. Right now, he was trying to figure out what type of weapon suited their respective abilities the most.

Carefully he watched their fighting styles, but there was something that he couldn't quite figure out that was bothering him a little.

"Some of the leaders' abilities I already know, but do you mind telling me all of their abilities? It would be in our best interest." Quinn asked.

"Of course. The first family possesses the ability to create an invisible force field around their body that can strike anything that comes within a certain range. The second family's ability is to reverse time on whatever they touch. The third family is able to produce Blood needles, stopping certain body parts from working properly. I know you have experienced this one yourself before.

"The fourth family has the ability to combust their own blood. The fifth family possesses the ability to communicate with any creature. The sixth family's ability is to set up invisible traps on the ground. The seventh family has the ability to harden an object, giving them the greatest defence.

"The eighth family used to have the ability of telepathy. Your own family possesses the ability of equivalent exchange.

"The eleventh family's ability is to get stronger with each hit. The twelfth family's ability is similar to the eleventh's, only that they gain extra speed for each successful hit. Finally, the thirteenth's family ability is string."

Out of all of those abilities, Quinn realised that one family, in particular, was missed out, and he was curious about something else as well.

"Bryce gave the order to disband the eighth family. I was wondering if there should still be vampires with that ability. Perhaps there should be a way to introduce them back. It is a good ability to have." Quinn wondered.

"There should still be plenty of vampires that have that ability, but they have been split between the other families. On top of that, the castle should have some information on that sadi ability, so if you wish to bring the eight family back, then feel free to do so. I don't think the leaders would object to this." Muka replied.

"And one more thing. You seem to have skipped the ninth family. What is your ability?" Quinn asked.

"My ability is always active. I believe that it is what allows me to stand by your side even now. The ability of luck." Muka answered.

"Luck? That can't be real, can it? How would that even work?" When asking this, Quinn was expecting Vincent to answer, but once again, he realised that the voice in his head was no more.

"I believe you will see it come to play at some point and time," Muka answered, and for the first time, Quinn heard a cheerful giggle. He noticed that the large armour and helmet she wore was what had deepened her voice.

Over the next few days, all the leaders had successfully learned how to utilise their Blood weapons and after observing them the King had put in a request for their weapons to be created. They weren't ready yet, but he feared that they could be running out of time.

The leaders would have probably learned it even faster if it wasn't for Fex's horrible explanation. Nonetheless, they had all succeeded in the end, and now they could pass on this knowledge to their own families as well.

'I guess it's time. Time to head back to the beast solar system, and give those damn Dalki a big surprise!' Quinn tensed his fists, and the veins on his head showed through as he thought about what they had done.

He was ready for some major payback!

# Chapter 1385 - The Upset Leader
A large sphere spaceship the same size of a small planet was slowly drifting through the Beast solar system. Given its massive size it was unable to move as fast as regular ships yet it was the one place the Dalki called home, consisting of land mass taken from the many beast planets they had conquered.

One side of the gigantic spaceship held a base, stationing many of the Dalki motherships that were ready to leave at a moment's notice. Right now, one of those ships was in the middle of docking into the large spaceship.

The motherships that were sent out would usually stay on the conquered planets and become the Dalki fortresses that would be used to station their troops. This was done for a few reasons, the most important one being that the ships themselves contained the jammers that would prevent humanity from teleporting onto the planet.

Another reason was their durability. Until the recent outlier, they had never managed to breach or destroy them. This was mainly due to the force fields they were able to produce with the large amount of crystals on board.

For this reason, it was strange to see one return, especially since it didn't seem to have suffered any major damage. Nevertheless, the Dalki on the spaceship hurried to welcome those on the mothership.

The Dalki were a very hard working race. They had to be given that they used the knowledge that was passed on to them when making new things, yet they were a hard race to control. All of them had the inner desire to improve and get stronger, to prove that they had the right to be the leader and command their fellow Dalki.

As such, the only way to control this race, to get them to focus on certain tasks aside from fighting, was for there to be an absolute leader among them. Someone who was far stronger than the rest of them, making the rest submit to him.

And that exact person was the first to exit the mothership. The Dalki who had taken a liking to wearing human clothes, descended down the ramp. Unexpectedly, he had a deep frown on his face. The thought of all the Dalki looking at this, knew this to be a rare sight to behold.

'Something must have happened during the attack.'

'Something definitely happened, he seems furious.'

Those were the common thoughts shared among them. Now that Graham had gotten closer to them, they could make out that the clothes on him were burnt, full of holes, and there was even green blood that covered his entire body.

"Why is he so angry?" One of them whispered to the Dalki next to him. "I heard that he successfully took over the planet."

"I heard that those humans put up more of a resistance than we had expected. Looking at his clothing and the blood, it seems to be true. Do you think he had to do 'that'?" The other asked.

Before the first one had a chance to answer, one of the higher spiked Dalki behind the two of them, kicked the back of their legs, reminding them to be quiet. There had been one time he had seen Graham as irritable as now and it hadn't been a pretty sight.

The Dalki stood by the side creating a path for him. At the very end there was a small ship waiting for him. He would then take this small ship to head to the castle or the lab to do whatever he wished to do next.

In front of the small ship there was a one spiked Dalki who was nervously holding a neatly folded set of clothes for the Dalki leader, next to a clone that looked identical to Jim. As he walked through the path, Graham pulled at his damaged clothing, ripping them off his body, throwing them on the ground without saying a word.

The one spiked Dalki took that as his cue and sprinted towards Graham, getting on his knees as he presented the items to the other. Graham didn't even acknowledge him as he grabbed the clothes and proceeded to put on the plain white top shirt.

However, before he could even try on the black trousers, a problem manifested itself. The moment the Dalki put his arm through the sleeve, it ripped. The clothes appeared to be a couple sizes too small for him.

"What is this?" Graham asked in clear annoyance. "I personally go out to battle and all I expect in return is for a pair of decent clothes to be prepared upon my return. Is that really too much to ask for?"

Graham looked around, as if he was waiting for someone to answer, but no one dared to say anything. Graham was the calm Dalki leader that talked things through, some who had never seen him act like this before were just wondering what was going on.

"The clothes aren't the problem." The clone let out a derisive laughter. "They were made based on the latest measurements taken. You must have gotten a little fatter while away."

Everyone else gulped hard, none of them daring to state such a truth, yet the clone didn't look scared or frightened like the rest of them. Instead it was more like it didn't care about what was going to happen next, as it saw a fist heading towards its head. It was a punch that completely tore the clone's head from his body, and the next second it smashed into the spaceship behind it, exploding on impact.

There was a dent left on the outer spaceship. Seeing this, the one spiked Dalki who had still been kneeling in front of Graham got scared and turned around, which was the worst decision it could have made, yet also his last. Before it could take more than one step, Graham opened its mouth wide, and the Dalki's whole head ended in his jaws.

The next second it clamped down, crushing the other's head. Green blood spewed out from his mouth as the other's lifeless body fell to the floor. Swallowing whatever bits it had left in its mouth, Graham seemed to be somewhat satisfied as he entered the small ship.

"He…he just killed a Dalki… for nothing?" One of them pointed out, "He didn't even challenge him to a fight, or say anything. I mean, it was normal for One Horn or Slicer to act like this but I have never seen Graham do something like that. Just what happened to disturb him this much?" One of them asked as they could see a ship floating in the air ready to set off.

"I'm not sure, we will just have to wait for the reports from his fight." The other replied, as they all headed back to work.

———

Left on his own, Graham was still reviewing his last fight, trying to understand when things had started to go wrong.

'Those girls, how could they do that? How was it possible for them to give me so much trouble?!' The Dalki leader clenched his fist. 'They even forced me to reveal my trump card, when I thought there would never be a need to! Well it's clear that means that I have to just get stronger.'

The ship eventually landed just outside the lab, where multiple Dalki awaited him outside, but the one giving the orders looked to be a three spike. When the ship landed Graham immediately got off and stood in front of the three spikes, still with a frown on his face, with fresh blood still sticking on his body.

"How is the creation process going?' Graham asked.

"It's going great, sir. We imported the information from Jim's lab as you have asked, and we have been able to narrow down which ones are more likely to produce bad results, so our output of higher spiked Dalki has increased exponentially." The Dalki reported, doing his best to ignore the other's outer appearance.

This was something that Logan had found out as well upon accessing information from Richard. Not all of the Dalki had been completely created from scratch. Instead, later generations had been fused with different Human DNA from different people, and in turn when mixing with the Demon tier beast this would produce different results depending who the human was.

However, when raiding Jim's lab, they had found some mutant DNA strands that didn't seem to be quite human nor vampire. They didn't know what they were, yet their success rate ended up being incredibly low.

It had been pure luck that the first experiment with one had succeeded, as the subsequent ones had demonstrated how hard it was to create one. Nevertheless, the reason why they had tried again and again was that that particular strain had produced the highest spiked Dalki compared to any of the others.

Through trial and error they also found other types of special human DNA, information gathered from ancient fossils, that seemed to be mixed with beasts that would produce good results as well.

"That's great, the Dragon still isn't low on energy either. We'll be able to create plenty more, and it doesn't seem like the humans are able to put up much of a fight. We will lose even less than I predicted. Send all the newly created three spikes and above over to me.

"They will be put to great use in making me stronger." Graham ordered, already walking away. Leaving the three spiked worried about just what Graham was going to do with these newborn Dalki.

*****

# Chapter 1386 - The First Of His Kind
Graham stood on a large open wasteland. The Dalki leader felt uncomfortable, as he still had no clothes to wear. He himself didn't know why, but it felt like everyone could see right through him when he didn't wear clothes, and without it whenever others laid their eyes on him, he wanted to snap at them.

However, at the moment there was no one but him. It was just an open land with several craters, but after waiting a while he could see them in the distance. A group of other Dalki was heading his way, and in the background, in the distance the Dalki castle could be seen.

'It looks like they are finally here. Hmmm, there's around fifty of them. I guess he wasn't lying when he said they were able to improve the creation process.' Graham smiled.

As he waited for them to arrive, he continued observing them. The new set of Dalki looked undisciplined. They weren't walking in a single file, and most of them continued to butt heads with each other as they walked. It looked like some were about to go into a full scuffle, while others had already fought and were bleeding.

There was one in front was a three spiked Dalki who had a digital tablet with him, and by his side there were two more three spiked Dalki, all stood away from the group.

"It's hard to blame them for their behaviour since we were the same when we first came to be." The one on the left commented. "I just hope Graham won't mind their unruliness."

"Indeed, I believe in some cases we were even worse. Fortunately, they were all smart enough to listen and follow us." The one on the right added.

"Alright!" The one in the centre said turning around. "I know you all must be confused. After all, you have only been awake for a couple of hours, and we have yet to tell you much about what is going on. Right now, we are taking you to Graham, one of our leaders. He has just returned from a major battle and he isn't in the best of moods, so it's in your own interest to show him the respect he deserves!"

It was then, that a larger Dalki out of the group, a four spiked pushed past the others and walked out in front.

"I came along because I was interested in this Graham character you've all been praising, but this is starting to become a pain! Why should I listen to someone who is clearly weaker than me?" The four spiked questioned the one in the middle with a challenging look.

The three spiked leaders felt nervous. There was one universal truth that all Dalki were aware of, without the need to fight. 'Those with more spikes than them were stronger'. It was only those with the same amount of spikes who would fight amongst themselves to establish a hierarchy.

Out of the new batch, there were a few four spikes that had been created from the mutant DNA strand. From the moment of their birth they had already surpassed the three spiked leaders, without ever having evolved on their own.

Before a fight could break out, Graham landed between the two parties, having jumped over.

"Then, will you listen to me?" The Dalki leader asked as he turned slightly to the side to show off the five spikes on his back. It was at this point that the four spike's ego took a hit, yet he still felt like he deserved more respect.

"You seem unhappy with your treatment. Don't worry, you will all get a chance to show off your worth." Graham looked in the sky. "The reason why I called you all over is because I want all fifty of you to take me on at the same time. As long as you survive I will bestow you a position befitting you. I swear that you will get all the respect and recognition you believe you deserve, so I want you to fight as hard as you can."

Graham then walked over to the four spiked Dalki, that had been so outspoken just moments ago.

"I wasn't joking. Part of you should already know that you were born into a dog eat dog world. If you can't prove your worth, you will all die here."

The four spiked looked down and he could see that Graham's arm had pierced right through his stomach. He hadn't even seen him move, yet the next moment the Dalki leader stood before him with an evil grin plastered on his face, his eyes showing no remorse.

The Dalki lifted its hands, trying to rip off Graham's head, but with his other single hand free the five spiked Dalki just hit them away, and pierced the other Dalki's stomach once again.

"I said try harder!" Graham shouted, punching out multiple times, causing large holes to appear on the Dalki's body. When he eventually stopped, the four spiked lifeless body fell to the ground. The others didn't know what to do, and when just standing there, Graham went to the next one.

Now knowing that their lives were on the line, the three spiked and four spiked Dalki, all fought together trying to take down Graham. Although none of them had the individual strength to take him down, with so many Dalki attacking him at once it was impossible for the Dalki leader to get out unscathed.

While everything was going on, the three Dalki had moved off to the side out of the fight that was going on.

"Those Dalki, they're some of the strongest members of our race despite just having been created. I thought Graham was just going to beat some discipline into them, so why is he choosing to kill them all?!" The three spiked Dalki on the right was shocked.

"I have been with him as long as you have. Do you think I would have any clue?" The one on the left shrugged his shoulders as they continued watching the Dalki leader fight.

They were happy to see that Graham hadn't chosen to kill everyone as they had feared. None of them doubted that he could easily kill off the three spiked Dalki with a single hit, yet so far he had chosen to hit all those he fought against in non vital areas.

Seeing this, they thought that Graham might have just killed off the first one to shock the others and get them to behave. From the looks of it, he seemed to be trying to make them evolve now of all times, yet that quickly turned out to not be the case.

Graham had injured his opponents to the point that they would get a massive power boost, but when he noticed that they still couldn't finish him, he started striking back and finishing them off. It would have been more useful to bring them back to the lab to heal their wounds, giving them more of a chance to evolve, yet today he seemed to lack patience.

"All of our hard work…" The Dalki in the middle felt awful. It didn't take long for the massacre to unfold, with not a single one being kept alive. All fifty or so of them had perished, yet the Dalki leader was only close to being out of breath.

"It's still not enough." Graham muttered to himself, as he looked over to the old generation Dalki. "Fifty is not enough, bring over a hundred next time!"

The three gulped, still not understanding Graham's actions. Even during the fight, he had allowed the stronger four spikes to hit him, and now he was asking to go through the process again?

However, they were in no position to argue. If they dared to, they knew it would just end with them being on the chopping block next. When they finally had a new hundred subjects they were sent out to Graham to repeat the process. When the three Dalki returned, they were surprised to see that all of the Dalki bodies had disappeared. Only with Graham picking at his teeth with his claw.

'Did he…eat them?' One of them wondered, it was the only thing they could think of.

Even hundred or so Dalki didn't fare any better than fifty. The same thing happened again, with a similar outcome. After killing off more than half of them, something finally happened to Graham's body.

The Dalki leader suddenly stopped and distanced himself from the survivors. There were already five large spikes running down his back, ran from the top of his back to his tail. There didn't seem to be room for anymore, but then, next to the largest spike at the top, another one could be seen forming out by the side.

Graham let out a scream as it grew out. He had evolved once again.

'This makes me the first official six spiked Dalki! … but this is still not enough!" It was then, that a ship out form the castle had landed, and three Dalki came out urgently searching for graham.

"Graham, we have some bad news! It's about the Vampire World. It seems like Arthur, along with all the others, failed their task. We have tried to contact them multiple times but there is no report whatsoever.

"We can only assume he has betrayed us, been killed, or gone back to the other side."

From the interactions Graham had with Arthur, he couldn't imagine the Punisher betraying them, not unless he was sure they could win, which was an interesting thought in itself, but from the daily reports they were getting Arthur had launched a full scale attack against the vampire settlement not long ago.

Graham couldn't think of anything that would make him suddenly turn, which could only mean that they had failed.

"Well, I didn't expect that. It looks like I really have to do all things by myself." Graham let out a sigh. "Looks like the rest of you are in luck."

# Chapter 1387 - Project Utopia
Surrounded by nothing but metal, and somewhere in the dark deep blue sea, was the submarine that was used for the base of Pure. Currently, an important experiment was taking place. There were a large number of test rooms on the submarine itself, and in one of them, there was a certain agent with a tablet in his hand recording all the information he could see.

This agent had quite long spiked hair that went down past his shoulders. It was ragged and unkept. On top of that, he had glasses on his face that would constantly slip down. It was a strange sight to see since nearly everyone these days got corrective surgery to fix their eyesight.

Only those that didn't have the money to afford such a surgery would wear glasses. Still, for this person, their reasoning was different. He wouldn't take the risk, even if the chances were minuscule of losing his eyesight.

This person was known as Agent four, and the large number on the back of his white robe showed it.

"I have never seen armour like this before. It doesn't act like any type of beast armour. Nor does it seem to be made from beast crystals, yet the only reaction we have seen so far from it is with blood.

"This is, without a doubt, from them." Agent 4 smiled, quickly typing away all of the details he had seen so far.

Right now, what Agent four had in front of him, was blood armour. It wasn't a single part, but lying out on a table, was what was thought to be a full set, which had gone through countless different experiments. It was his job to find out what it could do, among other things in Pure.

The sound of the door sliding open was heard behind him, but agent four chose to ignore it.

"Agent 0 is asking for your report. He says you have been here too long." The voice said from behind. The next second, the said person was standing by his side.

A person who hardly wore a top, always displaying his large body with battle scars to show. The one known as Agent 1, and also known as Chris.

"It was a lot more tricky than I thought, and the ability of this armour is impressive, but it will be troublesome. If blood is the only way to activate it, then how can one use it correctly in battle. The armour seems inefficient if that was to be the case.

"Vampires themselves have their own blood, but just like humans, it takes a certain amount of time before their body can recreate it. Of course, you could get blood from your victims, but then the active effect seems almost useless."

Chris wasn't really listening to what agent four was saying. He never really cared about all this stuff, so he just said the first thing that came to his mind.

"Maybe something is missing?" Chris replied. "You know, I mean, I know it looks like a full set, but perhaps there was a helmet or something with it?"

Agent four placed his finger on his chin, tapping it away as he thought. It was an interesting thought. He couldn't believe that whoever owned this armour would allow for such a big downside to it.

'Maybe what Chris said was right.'

"Anyway, you can work on this later. There is a meeting to take place, and I'm in charge of it. Nearly everyone is there." Chris said.

Usually, agent four would have decided to ignore the calls for a meeting. He felt his work was far more critical than the discussion the others would talk about. His research would help the whole group advance as a whole.

Regardless, because he knew what this meeting was concerning, he had decided to attend. Walking along with Chris in the main hall, they eventually found themselves in a nice area. Rather than the usual metal halls, they would see this area was carpeted grey and had clear glass in several places.

It was more like an office of the old. They had several seats out looking towards a particular wall facing the same way, with numbers 1 to 25 written on the back. All of the top members were told to attend this meeting, and Chris made his way to the empty space.

When everyone came in, Chris was ready to speak. Agent 0 wasn't present, and some of the seats were empty, but that wasn't because they had chosen not to attend or couldn't make it, but because they were dead.

There was a rule that had been set by agent 0. Although rankings could move up and down in the top 5, their positions wouldn't be filled, and two seats were empty at the front. Agent 5's and Agent 2s. It reminded them all that the group had failed in some way.

If they were to lose all of their leaders, then the Pure deserved to fall apart.

"I'm glad to see that most of you made it back safely, although we can't say the same for everyone or those that are still out there on the other planets." Chris started the speech. He stood there with his arms folded, and there was no need for him to use Qi to amplify his voice. It was plenty loud already.

"0 has been patient, carefully binding his time and waiting for the right opportunity. The Dalki have pushed and pushed, and it looks like the Earthborn group has had to send most of its forces to help them.

"The Graylash group, although having dealt with the threat well, are in no position to come back. As reports of a new wave of Dalki are hitting them, and as for the Cursed faction, they have had one of the biggest blows out of all the groups so far.

"Which means they are far too occupied to deal with us. Our movement begins now. All those who are ready with their squads and are in positions, please raise their hand."

Everyone in the room raised their hand at that moment.

"Then I give you permission to execute project Utopia now," Chris said.

All of them cheered in the room at that moment. They stood up from their seats, ready to move out. Seconds later, and nearly everyone on the Pure Sub started to move. Entering teleporters, some exciting from small pods in the submarine out in the water.

Pure was in full motion as if the group themselves was planning for war. Pure had decided to not take part in the fight so far. Not helping any of the other groups, seeing the outcome, but they finally chose to make their move.

Hours after Chris had made his announcement, countless submarines all over earth had remained a distance away from the land that was still left. Some of these cities would usually have top tier protection. Provided by the Earthborn group or their respective factions, but at the moment, they were mostly filled with high-class Civilians.

Those that had good backgrounds and chose no longer to fight or hunt, after all, living on earth was expensive. However, due to the current war, many of those that would be protecting them and the Travellers they paid for protection had gone out to fight.

The people understood. The Dalki were the threat, not humans. If they didn't win this war, then no money in the world could help them, but this left them unprotected at the same time.

Each group was stationed nearby these cities. The Pure members were geared up, ready for their order. The receiver of each group made a few crackles, and the order was given out.

The voice wasn't that of agent 1, but it was from the original creator of the Pure organisation, agent 0.

"Everyone, it is time for Pure to take over the government, the military and everything that is wrong with the world. When they come back, they will be in for a surprise to see that what they have been fighting for all this time has been lost. It's time for us to take over earth!"

# Chapter 1388 - The Lost Planet
Before leaving the vampire settlement, Quinn made sure to inform the tenth family of what was going to happen. How those that had worked under Paul, the vampire soldiers, would soon be returning to Earth, and he told the leaders that they should all inform their people as well.

For Quinn wanted to move the entire vampire settlement to the beast solar system. There was one major problem with this though, and that was the sunlight. All those vampires in the inner castle areas had rings that helped with the sunlight but not those in the pooling areas.

It wasn't that they lacked rings or resources, it was just that the vampires had never seen the need to make it so everyone could have rings. At the moment, another group was sent out to fight against the Death Bats, whose crystal was required to create those special rings.

As the King he told the leaders to not act themselves, warning them that they should remain on standby, but ready to act at any moment. Quinn hadn't explained exactly how or when he would call them, only that they had to prepare to be called at any moment in any situation.

There was something else that Quinn had on him, that was in his Shadow space. He had also taken the special mechanism that would be used to move the whole settlement in the first place.

'I have a lot of things in my dimensional space. The tablet, the Blood armor and Arthur's weapon, along with this stuff are all in there. Then there is also the Dragon that I have in the Shadow space. People would definitely be surprised if they knew that at this point, I'm practically a walking treasure trove.' Quinn thought with a silly grin on his face.

The dimensional space allowed him to store as much as he wanted in it, but it didn't allow him to store living things, while the Shadow space that was connected to his shadow lock could store living things. The only problem was using the Shadow space and Shadow lock would use a part of his MC cells.

In the past, this would have mattered quite a bit, but now thanks to the Original Punisher having bestowed all the MC cells he had accumulated over the centuries, Quinn had a higher amount than he had ever believed to be feasible. Without it, he wouldn't have dreamed about putting certain things like a Demon tier beast inside.

This had given him an idea, now he could store more things in his Shadow space.

With all this said, for the first time, an active King of the vampires was leaving the Vampire settlement and what's more, he was doing it alone. Quinn was heading back to the Cursed faction ship. Or at least that's where he thought he was heading.

Using his Shadow travel he came out from Sam's shadow, yet he soon found himself on top of a Shelter wall staring outward on the planet's surface. It was one that Quinn hadn't been to before.

The surface seemed to be clay like, though grey in colour. There were a few large stones out on the surface which had green plants growing on it here and there, and trees that seemed to stretch out from underneath these stones. Most of it was empty, apart from the areas which had been terraformed into the Shelter, with pathways and roads leading in and out.

That's when Quinn noticed the amount of people at the Shelter. Turning around, he could see it was packed. The buildings looked to have been changed to stack on top of each other like apartment blocks, while the streets were filled with people pushing past each other to get to where they were headed.

'A top Shelter like this usually has around fifty thousand or so people but it looks like there are over double, if not triple that number, down there.'

"Quinn." Sam called out, not having noticed his arrival beforehand. "I know you said you were coming, but I didn't realise that you would be here so soon. That was fast."

A smile appeared on Sam's face as he was happy to see the Cursed faction leader actually be okay, yet the smile quickly disappeared as he remembered that they would have to discuss certain things and talk about business.

"Actually, it's a good thing that you came out while I'm here. The two of us can talk about everything here without having to worry the others." Sam said.

"Are the others in the Shelter?" Quinn asked.

"Not everyone. A few are in the Shelter, many are on the other walls and some are on the Cursed ship that is stationed behind the Shelter. The rest have split up to take care of the other Cursed planet that is still under our control."

As Quinn was listening to Sam, he was looking outward to see if he could gather basic information of what this shelter was like out here. He could see that there was one of the Dalki motherships very far off in the distance thanks to his great eyesight.

There were also multiple stations that were set up between here and the Shelter, forces to stop the Dalki from making an outright attack out of the blue. Looking at it Quinn was thinking about a few things.

"So I take it that the influx of people inside the Shelter… are the survivors from the Daisy faction?" Quinn finally asked.

Hearing this, Sam clenched his fist hard, and even now after so much time had passed since that event had occurred tears started to flow down his face.

"We were there, Quinn. All of us were there. I knew they were going to attack, I had hoped that all of us would be enough to hold them back, but…" The Vampire Lord placed his hand on the other's shoulder before he completely broke down.

"I don't blame you. … If anything, I blame myself. It was my choice to go to the Vampire World instead of helping you out. I was hoping I could deal with Arthur before coming over, yet I never expected for things to suddenly take a turn for the worse with the appearance of the Original King.

"However, we can't know if things would have actually changed even if I had been with you. Despite being there I failed to save them." Some of the words he repeated to Sam were told to him by Vincent, yet his ancestor wasn't in his head anymore to drop his wisdom, so it was up to Quinn.

"They died, even though I was there. Paul… Kazz… Arthur. I know exactly how you feel but we have to push forward and save what we can." Quinn spoke.

Wiping away his own tears with the sleeve of his shirt, Sam tried to put on a brave face. Quinn had yet to tell him the full details of what occured in the vampire world. At the same time, if anyone was to see him like this, especially those in the Cursed faction they would see him as weak.

As one of the leaders who frequently appeared in front of the other faction members, it was important for him to put on a brave face whenever possible.

"Quinn, I have a plan and with you here now, the chances that it will succeed have greatly increased. I don't know what the Dalki are planning, but this time, after they had captured the Shelter, they kept hostages.

"I asked all of the other groups, but there have never been any cases that they did something like this in the past. There are members of the Daisy faction that are still alive at the Shelter. I think they might be thinking of using them as some type of bargaining tool or maybe something else.

"I want to save them, but I was too scared, too worried that I would make the same mistakes again."

Hearing Sam talk like that was making Quinn worried. He had never heard the other sound so unconfident before. Sam had made far better decisions than he himself could have ever done on his own, which was exactly why he had left him in charge on this side.

However, he had said these words to him before. Some people just needed time.

"Sam, you should rest and look after this Shelter. Let me deal with the Daisy faction prisoners. I will save them." Quinn stated confidently.

"But…Quinn you don't understand how many they have, how strong they all were! The worst part is, if they use them as hostages, they won't hesitate to kill them in seconds!" Sam had been stressing over this more than anything. The problem had never been attacking the Dalki to retrieve the abducted people, but making sure there would actually BE anyone left to rescue at the end.

"Trust me, I have my ways, did you call over Bonny and Void like I requested?"

Looking in the Shelter, the two stood out like a sore thumb, with drones hovering above them, and even now they were talking to the public reporting news to everyone.

"That's great. I'm going to need them. Don't worry you will understand, when you see it all." Quinn said. "I guess it's time I head to the Daisy faction."

'Helen, I hope you kept your promise.'

# Chapter 1389 - Unique Power
Although Sam still wasn't so sure about Quinn going out on his own, he couldn't really disagree with him, for he was already making movements. He had ordered a small ship to be sent to him, along with Bonny, Void and Nate.

These were the only people that he would be taking along with him, to the Daisy faction planet. Even now, Sam was standing out the front of the Shelter, giving a send off to the group, he was deeply concerned.

'Quinn I know you're strong, but you didn't see the things that we saw when they attacked…we were useless against him. I just hope that you don't run into him there.' Sam thought.

With that, Quinn and the others entered the small ship, and were off heading towards the Daisy planet. While inside, Bonny and void were testing their equipment, trying to see if everything was working as it should.

"It looks like you guys have had a few upgrades since the last time I saw you." Quinn commented as he looked at the heavily reinforced drones.

Bonny chuckled.

"Of course, and we have to thank Logan Green for it. When he came to this planet, the first thing he did was improve our equipment for us. Glathrium is usually quite a heavy material but he managed to somehow make it light enough so our drones can still fly while enjoying the strong protection.

"So whatever you have planned, we will definitely be able to catch it all."

It was music to the Vampire Lord's ears. This event was going to be big and Quinn wanted everyone to see what was going to happen, but first he needed to know exactly what the current situation was.

At the moment, not far from there, in the ship's centre, Nate was practicing his martial arts, he currently had the Demon tier Shield in his hand, yet there was now a strap on it that had been created for it.

This was moveable, allowing him to move it up and down his forearm if he wished, still giving him access to it on his arms without taking it off. Of course, he also had the Shadow ability so he could use Shadow equip for it as he wished.

"Quinn, are you really sure we can take on their side with just the two of us?" Nate asked, as he threw out a punch, and imagined an enemy in front of him, but then something else appeared in his head as he was practicing.

Quinn could see that his eyes started to stare slightly upward and Nate was slightly frozen, he even gulped.

'What enemy is he imagining right now? What happened to them all?' Quinn wondered. He had heard from Sam, but hearing and experiencing were two different things.

"Don't worry Nate, if everything goes according to plan, there won't even be any need for you to fight." Quinn answered, hoping to cheer the other up. "Let me take care of the Dalki. The reason why I asked you to come with us, is primarily so you can protect Bonny and Void. They will be filming from the spaceship above, and using their drones.

"There is a good chance that they could be attacked, but with your Shadow powers and that Shield you should be able to stop everything that comes your way."

For a second, Nate felt annoyed that he had been brought along just for bodyguard duty, but that quickly went away as he thought back to what had happened during the last fight.

'I can understand Sam, but even Nate is like this.' Quinn noticed, making him bite his bottom lip.

"Nate, what happened? I know the Dalki attacked the Daisy faction, but Sam says that you were all there. You had the Demon tier Shield, so even if they were strong…Who did you meet?"

It took a few seconds for Nate to reply, but he thought that Quinn should know, especially if there was a good chance that they could be seeing this Dalki again.

"It was a Dalki who was wearing clothes…a five spiked Dalki." Nate explained. "Sam's plan was working perfectly and with the help of everyone we were actually able to defend. It seemed like any other day, and we were sure it would end in yet another stalemate… but everything started to change when he attacked."

Hearing this, Quinn remembered that when Richard was speaking, he spoke about the major threats the other side had, and one of them was a Dalki named Graham. He was the only Dalki Quinn had seen wear clothing, and seemed to be quite unique in his preference.

'It's him again, the Dalki I met that time when I was controlling one of the Dalki…his power was great and even with all the strength of the other Dalki I was unable to do anything, but that was then…could he really be strong enough for Arthur to be scared of? and the others.'

It looked like Nate had more to tell, so Quinn continued to listen, hoping he would get his answer.

"We knew how strong five spikes were, but we thought that with Sil, with everyone having improved and the equipment you gave us, that we might have been able to beat him by banding together.

"Initially, we weren't too afraid of him. Slicer had that dangerous tail, yet he didn't seem to have anything that made him out to be that special aside from those normal looking clothes. We were able to put up a good fight, even able to injure him to a good degree.

"However, then he started to do something strange. After realising that he was unable to take all of us on his own he picked up a Dalki corpse and devoured it. As the fight continued, he even grabbed live ones and just bit into them. Each time he did, he seemed to grow stronger to the point that we became unable to do much against him."

Thinking about what Nate had said so far, Quinn was wondering whether Dalki could grow stronger from eating their own kind or if that was something unique to Graham. The latter seemed to be the likelier case, as they had never seen other Dalki do that before. Back when he had controlled the Dalki, although he didn't test it, he hadn't felt any desire to cannibalise his fellow Dalki.

'It must be a special trait. From the information we gathered so far, Silcer's tail, and the one that attacked the Graylash family was able to produce energy from his hands. The Dalki around the five spikes level seem to all have gained a special trait.'

"That wasn't the end Quinn…that Dalki, he could change…he transformed, and that was when we knew we were doomed. I know you already know the rest of what happened after, but it was lucky that we all came out of it alive to be honest."

The conversation ended there. It seemed that Nate didn't want to go on and tell Quinn the full details for fear that he would be distracted, or it was because he thought Sam would have told him the rest.

The thing was, Quinn wanted to hear what happened directly from the people, and there was still a chance…

Eventually, the medium size ship had entered the planet's atmosphere, the beautiful flowers that had been planted all around, looked to have been burnt, including those on the Shelter walls. It was nothing like when Quinn had seen it before.

"Alright, Bonny Void, it's time to start recording." Quinn said as he stood up and used his Shadow equip to change into the red blood armour on his body.

It was the first time the others had seen this, and it was certainly eye-catching to them. Something they had never seen before, it was drawing them all in. The next second, Void started recording and made sure his drones were also ready.

"Hello everyone watching at the moment, I'm Quinn Talen, leader of the Cursed faction. As you may know the Daisy faction that was part of the Cursed faction has recently been taken over. They tried their best but eventually lost to the attacking force.

"The Dalki have captured some of them that are currently being held hostage. We will be approaching the Shelter any second now. The truth is, I know everyone is struggling in all of the groups…and as their leader I apologise to everyone that I was away during the Cursed faction's toughest times.

"However, the reason why I was away was because I went to ask for help. It is the kind of help that the human race needs right now to win this war and fight against the Dalki. I have asked to be recorded today, to demonstrate the power of our allies."

The door to the spaceship was opened, and they were now directly above the Shelter. It looked like many of the Dalki were already alerted, but Quinn didn't care, as he jumped down.

Void quickly moved to make sure he catched everything, and at the same time, the drones were sent out, quickly following Quinn as well.

Shadows started to appear from Quinn's back as he fell. The Dalki that jumped towards him never reached him, as the Vampire Lord quickly placed them in his Shadow lock, allowing him to crash down into the centre of the Shelter unobstructed.

"Right now everyone, as you can see, Quinn has entered the Shelter, which is currently filled with hundreds of Dalki all on his own." As Bonny reported these words, she was wondering who exactly those allies he was talking about were.

"System." Quinn called out. "Activate the Summon skill."

# Chapter 1390 - Quinn's Return
Since the war between the Dalki and the human race had started, the two had gone through different phases in the war. One of the worst attacks they had suffered was the initial blitz, where a Dalki mothership appeared on each planet.

Then soon after, strong forces had been sent to the Graylash first, and later to the Cursed faction. However, right now, they are in another calmer period. Neither side was fully pushing forward. Not that the humans felt like they could, they were clearly on the defensive.

After hearing the news of what had happened to the Cursed faction, it was a big morale blow to both the Graylash faction and Earthborn group. None of it caught live, but it was the first planet they had lost since the humans had decided to condense their forces onto nine beast planets.

On top of that, the Cursed faction had lately been seen as the strongest of the three groups. With all the accomplishments they had been making, especially with Quinn being able to destroy multiple of the Dalki mother ships.

Which was why when they heard the news of what happened, even without Quinn there, they couldn't quite believe it. It was the first great loss for the Cursed faction.

Since it was a quiet period during the war, all eyes were tuned in on the special Livestream that Bonny had prepared. Sach, who was still on the snow planet, was in his base watching the Livestream along with Samantha and other few high personnel.

On the Graylash planet, they were also tuned in, along with several civilians and more. Bonny's Livestream had become one of the few places that were still active and broadcasting, and they knew that they captured the best moments and were the closest to the truth.

What helped more so was that Bonny was able to tell everyone that Quinn, the Cursed faction leader, had something he wanted to show the world. The only thing was, they expected to see a message. The last thing they expected to see was Quinn having decided that he would go on the attack.

"Quinn, you're fighting on your own, I know you're strong, but this was something your whole group couldn't deal with!" Sach was worried.

On the other hand, Samantha was interested in who these allies were that he was referring to. Then there was Owen, who was watching it with a big smile on his face.

"So that is the man who you think will change everything," Grim commented, Owen's grandfather.

"There is one thing the others don't seem to understand about him," Owen replied. "If he says he is going to do something, then he will do it. There was one point and time I thought he was crazy. When he said he would be going to save his friend on Blade island…and yet here we are, and you are today. If there is one person's word I trust more than anyone, it would be his."

Everyone saw Quinn land in the centre of the shelter, and the drones were in perfect position. The ship was also able to move fast and get in position. With the Dalki mainly concentrating on Quinn, they were able to get optimal angles, and the broadcast was able to catch nearly everything.

The Dalki were ready to pounce, but suddenly, several lights could be seen on the ground around Quinn. The next second, a bright light appeared, showing multiple figures around him. When they arrived, they looked just as puzzled as the people who were watching the broadcast.

"Where did they come from, where were they hiding, was it an ability?"

"It looked like they all just teleported there or something."

"What are they wearing, it looks like none of them has beast armour or beast weapons."

"Except that one that's dressed in that thick armour from head to toe."

The users were quickly commenting about the situation, and as a camera zoomed in closely, there was a feature that was noticed on them all.

"They all have red eyes."

"Is this the allies Quinn was talking about?"

Some viewers had a hunch about what was going on, but there was no confirmation just yet.

"Everyone," Quinn said. "I said to be prepared at any moment, don't hold back and fight all the Dalki, save the humans! This is an order!" Quinn's voice was serious, more severe than any of the leaders had heard before, and they could see the Dalki already coming towards them.

With no weapons, immediately, the first thing they did was use their abilities and blood powers. Many of them fired off blood swipes hitting the Dalki away. The leader's blood powers were stronger than most, and the Dalki were gravely injured as they were hit. Seeing this, the viewers knew that their confirmation was right.

"V, these people are V. Did Quinn call more V. I know some of the Cursed factions were V, but not all of them were, and I have never seen these before."

"Who cares? Look how easily they are dealing with the Dalki. There are two spikes and three spikes in this group."

The leaders themselves had improved somewhat, in the past, even they would have had some trouble with the three spiked Dalki, but their small training had shown considerable improvements in their powers, and some were showing just how impressive they were.

Jin showed off his explosive blood, firing it out, and dealing with three or four Dalki at once. He also wasn't slow when it came to hand to hand combat.

At the same time, there was Lee, who was using his string abilities to wrap one of the Dalki and swung them around like children, hitting them into each other. Also, with a pull of his strings, he was able to tear some of their limbs off.

The leaders were quickly killing all of the Dalki in the area, and they were simply no match for them. So much so that not even a single one could get close to Quinn.

"I… I'm not needed at all." Nate said from the spaceship. "I think even if we were down there, they wouldn't let a single Dalki get close to us."

"Who are these people?" Bonny asked. "Do you know anything?"

Nate wasn't sure how much he could tell, nor did he know much at all. What Nate was concerned about was what Quinn had done to get these powerful vampires on their side.

'What type of deal did he make?'

"We need to find the survivors," Quinn said, lifting his hands up. It was then that the green blood started to lift from the ground, and Quinn's eyes began to glow red. The leaders were still fighting but noticed what Quinn was doing. He was using absolute blood control.

The blood looked to just be floating, staying in place, but in reality, since Quinn had time and knew he couldn't be disturbed, he was able to condense the blood into small little pellets.

"Get back!" Quinn shouted.

The leaders jumped back to where Quinn was, and they noticed that all of the pellets of blood were in the air floating outside of the area around him.

Moving his hand, in a single motion, all of the pellets struck outwards like bullets, hitting the remains of Dalki that were visible in the area, mainly aiming for their heads. The next second, nearly all of them fell to the ground.

The viewers at that moment had all stopped typing. In almost an instant, Quinn had killed around a hundred or so Dalki, all on his own. They had heard feats of what Quinn had done before, but those stories were different.

This time, they had seen it in person, and it was so effortless.

"This shelter is a large one. Spread out, use your noses and let me know if you find any humans." Quinn ordered.

At the same time, all of the leaders answered, and the camera was able to pick up what was said clearly.

"Yes, your majesty."

With that, the leaders split, disappearing from the cameras.

******

# Chapter 1391 - A Royal
"Yes, Your Majesty."

These three words had been clearly broadcast worldwide, yet everyone who watched the livestream didn't quite understand the meaning behind them. These words were usually used when addressing someone of royalty, yet it had been ages since any humans had referred to another one as such. Because of that, it took everyone a few moments to really know what they meant.

"Do I have a problem with my ears or did those V just call the Cursed faction leader 'Your Majesty'? Do V have some type of hierarchy? All of them V listened to Quinn as soon as he spoke."

"Not unless we both have problems with our ears… Could it be that he is some type of prince to them? Is that why they were listening to him?"

"Was the Cursed leader lying to us? Can we even be sure that he hasn't been a V this whole time? For all we know all of the problems with the V could have to do with him!"

"But he's fighting for us right now! They are fighting against the Dalki! I know the Cursed faction, not all of them are V! Quinn Talen is a good leader!"

Although views were split on whether Quinn used to be a human or had been a royal figure all along, there was one common consensus. He was someone important to those strong V, and they were listening to his words. It was clear that he was in charge of them.

This had not only come as a surprise to those on all the planets watching the livestream but including those closest to Quinn, those that were currently in the Cursed faction. Although their reaction was much different.

On the Cursed planet, nearly every available vicinity was showing Bonny's live stream, and those that had been in the cursed faction for a while now couldn't help but be proud of their leader.

"Look at Quinn! That power to destroy those damned Dalki! This is why the Cursed faction is the best group to be in!"

They had long gotten over the fact that Sam, Quinn and some of the other higher-ups were V. They had been with them long enough to know they were loyal to all those in the Cursed faction. They had been with them through countless fights to know that their actions were genuine, and if anyone disagreed they weren't afraid to tell them off.

"How…can we trust someone who has this much help from those V… they could betray us at any time!" Someone commented while watching the show in a bar-like venue.

"Shut your mouth!" Another person shouted. "That is the Cursed faction leader, and the only reason why we're all safe right now is because of them. As long as you are here, I won't let you say another bad word about them. If you doubt him, then just get off this planet right now and join the Earthborn or Graylash group!"

Where Sach was, the leaders were also discussing what they had seen Quinn do, rather than being happy that he was able to kill the Dalki straight away, they were afraid at how much power Quinn had been able to obtain not just himself but with those by his side.

'Quinn, I knew you were a vampire, but nobody told me you carried this high of a position…there is only so much I can do as Supreme Commander…but I will agree with whatever it is you chose.' Sach thought.

Finally, there was also Sam's thoughts on this. He did not know what Quinn had done either, only that the situation on the other side had been resolved.

'Quinn, you really did it. You somehow made those stubborn leaders pick you as King, and you have gotten them to help us.' Sam thought. 'I understand your plan of showing this power to the world, but I believe it is a double edged sword.

'You will create those that will attack you out of fear from this, there will be others that react in the same way that Innu had done. Humans are strange things…but at the same time, what else can humans do? You have extended your hand out to help them, giving them this option, a solution to the situation they are in…and they will have no choice but to accept it.'

——

Inside the Shelter the leaders had split up, and so had the drones. Void and Bonny had control of more drones than they did before, and had sent out some to look and follow the vampire leaders, while the main space ship along with one of the drones would follow Quinn.

The Shelter was large, and there were Dalki spread out everywhere in the place. Plenty of the buildings around had been destroyed as well, from the last fight, making it easier to see far in the distance.

One of the leaders the drones had followed, had entered a large empty building. It was one who wore all black, and had a strange mask covering the bottom half of his face. The building was filled with around four different Dalki.

A mixture of one spikes, two spikes going up to three spikes. The first one to strike was a three spiked Dalki, which sprinted forward throwing out a fist, but the leader stood there unafraid, throwing a fist back himself.

The audience watching knew one thing about the Dalki, the more spikes they had the greater their power. Even the strongest of ability users wouldn't go head to head with a Dalki in the battle of strength yet this V was fearless.

When the two fists collided, to their surprise, there was a clear winner as the bones in the Dalki's arms had been crushed. The V didn't stop there and created a blade of blood aura to slice the enemy's head off right after, before proceeding to deal with the rest in the room.

"These are a bit of a pain." The V mumbled, turning around and seeing the drone, placing a thumbs up towards the camera. This leader was none other than Vincent, who had decided to wear a mask so others wouldn't notice how similar he looked compared to Quinn in this regard.

At the same time, the drones had caught many of the other leaders fighting, using their blood powers and abilities, finishing off the Dalki easily. There were a few that struggled a little bit but it was because they had been told not to use their full power and avoid using their new inner blood weapons. Quinn didn't want to reveal everything just yet, especially since there was always the chance the Dalki might also be watching this. They still needed their own trump cards.

Out of the newer leaders that were struggling, one of them was Nicu.

Nicu, the first leader, was on a pile of rubble and the Dalki had followed him somewhat. He was confident in his barrier ability, but one of the three spiked Dalki pushed through, even with its hand being shredded it managed to skim across Nicu's chest clawing at it, and blood was drawn.

"You filthy creature, how dare you spill my blood!" Nicu shouted, then using his sword, he quickly slashed the Dalki multiple times to finish it off.

That's when the viewers also saw that the cut on Nicu's chest had already healed. Watching all the clips of the leaders fighting, the viewers noticed something on top of the healing.

"Hey, has anyone else noticed that all these strong V don't seem to have any beast gear on? Apart from that twirp using a sword, the rest don't seem to even be using beast weapons?"

"Holy crap, you're right, even the V that we came across were using beast weapons and were already strong, are these top tier V or something? How can they be this strong without beast gear and armour."

"Do you think they're like the Dalki? Those guys can't use the power of beast weapons, so maybe it's the same for V?"

"But then what about Quinn? The Cursed faction leader is also a V, right? He uses beast equipment all the time, so I think they can definitely use it. Maybe they have just chosen not to?"

"If what you're saying is true, then that means this is just their own strength. Just imagine how much stronger they could be with beast gear! I bet they could even make short work of four spiked Dalki!"

In the viewer's eyes the vampire leaders already had an immeasurable amount of strength. However, as soon as someone mentioned that possibility, it spread like wildfire. Some immediately started writing articles about the V being 'humanity's new hope!', whereas others felt more scared than ever.

*****

# Chapter 1392 - Super Dalki
The vampire leaders were doing as Quinn had ordered, and following their nose they were able to pick up particular scents. Dalki and humans each had their own scents, different from vampires, but they still had to be relatively close to find them.

However, there was one thing that had led two leaders, Sunny and Jin, to a particular location, and that was the smell of blood. To vampires, the smell of blood was far more prominent and they could notice it from much further away. Unfortunately, since they could smell human blood, especially as prudent as this one was, it wasn't exactly a good sign.

The smell had led the two leaders to a particularly large building. It was a giant greenhouse that was covered in glass. Inside looked like it spread for miles and it was the only green plants that didn't look to be too destroyed.

"The smell of those plants is quite annoying." Sunny commented, as she covered her nose.

"Still, the blood smell led us here, so let's head inside." Jin shrugged his shoulders, doing his best to tolerate the plants.

Inside, the two of them noticed that the drone had followed them, floating a short distance away. It was clear that the two of them were being watched right now. If it wasn't for Quinn telling them not to interfere, then they would have destroyed it by now.

The vampires didn't like being viewed. They had spent centuries away from humanity's eyes and yet suddenly each and every one of their moments was being watched by people they didn't even know. The two did their best to ignore it, as they headed further inside.

As they walked through, there were the same pathways. The green house seemed to be designed similarly to a tourist attraction, there was the sound of a waterfall and plants laid out in all types of different ways.

"It's such a beautiful place, but it stinks." Sunny complained, still covering her nose.

"Well, it looks like the Dalki think we can't tell they are here either." Jin said, looking through the greenery and seeing a Dalki off in the distance. The next second, using his speed, he ran through, avoiding stepping on the precious plants, after the Dalki who was fleeing instead of fighting.

With its back turned, Jin jumped at the creature, placing his hand on the Dalki's head. The tips of his fingers were slightly cut, allowing him to release a small amount of blood. Once he had let out enough, he ignited his blood, causing a small explosion.

After the smoke had cleared, the Dalki's head was no more. It was lying on the ground, dead.

"It looked like the Dalki was heading somewhere. Do you think it was going to inform the others?" Sunny asked her partner. "Do they not know that they are being attacked? Surely from when we first arrived, everyone should have noticed it."

The viewers who were watching were able to hear the conversation between the two vampire leaders and had come to their own conclusion. The Dalki were suitably armed, and even if they had heard the sound of fighting coming from the centre of the Shelter, they might have believed that the others had already dealt with the intruders.

It might have been the case as well, since the leaders were able to finish off all the Dalki in the area quickly, before they even had the chance to inform the others.

Eventually, heading in the direction of the smell of blood and where the Dalki was heading towards, they encountered more of them. They had come across a wide spread area that was just in front of an artificially made waterfall.

In the midst of the Dalki group, the humans were kneeling on the ground, they weren't tied up. It appeared that they were staying through fear alone. Not wishing to move, and some could understand why, since there weren't many of them left.

There were only nine female survivors along with one male, yet a pile of bodies was floating not too far away, in the water behind them.

"This is the strong scent of blood we could smell. The waterfall is spreading the smell out." Jin mumbled.

Wasting no time, the two leaders quickly went out. Initially, the prisoners seeing them appear began to harbor hope, thinking that someone had come to rescue them, but seeing that there were only two people they didn't think they could do much, especially since there were ten Dalki or so that were guarding them.

That was until they watched Sunny dodge a swipe from a two spike Dalki, and lift up her leg kicking it in the face. It looked like a simple kick, nothing special, yet, the Dalki's head flung back, and the creature fell to the ground with its face slit open.

During her attack, she had used blood hardening on her leg, creating a type of blade that was able to pierce the hard skin. Of course, this was the hardening of a vampire leader. The strength, the speed and power of the attack was different and was why she was able to do such a thing.

After that, the two dealt with the Dalki, one after another and they were saved, but the Daisy factions were aware while watching the fight that the ones that had saved them were V.

"We have been sent by His Majesty to save you. I believe you all know him as Quinn Talen." Sunny informed them.

As soon as they heard that name, they looked at each other and smiles appeared on their faces.

"He saved us! He didn't forget about us!" Hearing this news, they no longer were worried about what these two would do to them.

Both Sunny and Jin saw the reaction of the people and were quite impressed.

'It looks like the King really is a respected figure to the humans as well. I wonder what he went through to earn that much respect from them at his young age.'

Since Sunny had a nicer face, the survivors were less afraid of her and willing to follow her, at the same time, as she began to lead them out of the green house, Jin looked at the river. Bodies floating, limbs having been ripped off and even dead bodies on the ground.

The drone that had been following them, looked to be filming all of this as well.

"What is that V doing there just standing there looking at them."

"He must be thinking something along the lines of 'look at all this wasted food', lol."

"Yeah, I mean he is a V after all, we might get to see them drink some blood live!"

"What is wrong with you people? How could you say that? Did you not just see that they risked their lives to save those people. If they weren't there then it's possible that all of them could have been beaten. I can't believe, why do you have to be this distrusting of them all?"

"Too long, didn't read! These freaks eat humans and they didn't help us until now! How can you be such a sheeple to NOT be cautious of them?"

——

At the same time, they weren't the only leaders that had come across humans. In one of the apartment buildings, Vincent had also just defeated a group of Dalki that were guarding some captives.

He was looking at them all frightened, and had noticed a slight observation. They all had a pinprick on their arm. Which was suggesting they had been injected with a needle of some kind. After asking them some questions it seemed to be the case that they were taking blood from the humans, not just once, but sometimes several times.

'So the Dalki didn't just take them to hold them hostage. They are definitely doing something with the captives, but what?' Vincent wondered. 'They didn't before, so I can only guess it has something to do with the Demon tier beast they have captured. Even without the second half they seem to be able to create more Dalki.

'From the information we have, the Dalki can also be based on mixing specific human and the beast's DNA. Is that it? Are they capturing the strong members from Daisy, in order to create a better and stronger Dalki? It seems to be the most likely case.

"Alright everyone, it's time for me to get you out of here." Vincent spoke to the survivors.

'Whatever they are planning, I don't like it. If my hunch is correct, we might soon be facing off against a new wave of super Dalki.'

# Chapter 1393 - Untouchable (Part 1)
After the other leaders had split up, Quinn had decided that the best course of action for him was to head straight forward towards the back of the Shelter. The last time he was here, it was where the Daisy base was located, but at the same time, he realised that it was where most of the chaos had taken place.

It was clear that a great battle had happened, and the Daisy faction had made their last stand here.

Rather than running straight ahead, Quinn was walking through the Shelter concentrating and focusing. Getting closer to the main base, he could smell blood everywhere. Not only smell it, but he could see many victims. Bodies that had only slightly decomposed and worse off were just left there on the street. Blood splatters covered the buildings and broken walls.

Quinn wanted to see if anyone was still left to save, but he hadn't run into anyone yet.

'The Daisy faction, it was such a beautiful place when I first came to visit it. I remember talking to them all not too long ago. It was meant to be one of the most protected places, due to all the plants inside and on the outside wall…and yet it still ended up like this.' Quinn grinded his teeth.

'Helen, you were strong. I can tell you all put up quite a fight trying to protect this place, didn't you…but I need to know…are you still alive. We had a promise, remember, you're not a liar. You're someone who keeps their promises, right!'

As he walked closer towards the Shelter, Quinn was thinking of the worst as more dead bodies could be seen. Eventually, several Dalki had come out from the rubble of the buildings.

Bonny and Void were still in the air, following Quinn with their personal camera and one of the drones.

They could also tell what Quinn was trying to do and decided to help with the search but couldn't find anyone just like him, anyone alive at least. One of the Dalki's did, however, spot them. They stood behind a high pile of rubble. With a simple jump, it was easy for them to reach the spaceship.

Seeing this, Nate got his shield ready. The good thing about the Demon tier shield was most enemies didn't know its effect and would think that it was just a simple shield. The Dalki being the aggressive beings they were, would just punch the shield without thinking much of it, killing themselves in the process.

Just as suspected, the Dalki leapt up to the ship aiming to hit it.

'You guys are worse than monkey's.' Nate thought, placing his shield in front of him, but as the Dalki was halfway in the air towards the ship, out of nowhere, blood slightly splattered from one side of its head.

Its eyes quickly appeared lifeless as it fell back down to the ground. All of those on the ship were wondering what had happened, and looking towards Quinn, they could see he had his hand held out with his finger pointed like a gun.

"Did that come from Quinn, he's protecting us even now, but it didn't seem like the same attack as he made before?" Bonny noticed.

Void, thinking the same thing, decided to play the footage back in slow motion frame by frame, and that's when he could see a small bullet the size of red aura going through the Dalki's head.

If other vampires had seen this, they would have thought that Quinn had just produced the blood bullet, but that was not the case as his finger was perfectly working.

"When I obtained all that power from before, I didn't have the time to learn it properly, but now I can test it out on you and make you all pay for what you did!" Quinn said, lifting his hand and now had his hands out with his fingers pointed as if they were both guns.

What Quinn had done was create his own blood bullet. With his blood powers having increased, his red aura was strong. Then mixing it in with the third stage of Qi, he could make it even more powerful.

Lastly, he had absolute blood control. A blood swipe in itself wasn't that fast, but Quinn had seen how fast Bryce was able to move the raining swords, and seeing this, he figured it was due to the blood control, and Quinn was right.

Using the control, he could move the blood fast enough, so it would work similar to the blood bullet skill but have no drawbacks.

The Dalki started to charge towards him, and without holding back, Quinn began to fire away. He wasn't the best when it came to aiming, but it didn't matter. The Dalki had no defence against such an attack.

If the blood aura hit their arms or legs, it would go through them. Still, they could see Dalki dropping dead easily before they even reached Quinn in front of the area.

It looked like a scene out of a war from the past. As if a person holding two guns in his hands while the others hand nothing but their bare fists. The only problem was that Quinn couldn't use this skill rapidly due to the amount of concentration it would take, but that didn't matter either.

Some of the Dalki eventually reached him. He could have used his shadow to block their attacks, or maybe something else, but instead, he chose to use his blood skills. With the blood armour equipped, he could do so without holding back.

He avoided the punch from the Dalki easily, and then Quinn threw a simple punch to the Dalki's gut, using his normal blood spray. As his fist connected, the Dalki was lifted into the air. When the blood spray skill activated, a bang was heard, and a hole through the entire Dalki's stomach was seen, causing it to die instantly.

'I can mix my powers better now. I can use the red aura energy I obtained without it hurting my body too much. As long as I limit myself to using the blood control with my own aura, it doesn't hurt my body. Only when I also control blood from the outside, it affects me.'

After this, Quinn used the shadow equip to change his armour, changing it into the blue fang set.

[Nitro accelerate activated]

In the two minutes that the armour was activated, the camera was unable to pick up anything clearly. All they could see was Dalki losing body parts and falling to the ground out of nowhere until there was no more.

And once Quinn was done, he switched back to the red blood armour standing there.

"What are we watching right now…" Bonny was at a loss for words. She didn't even know how to report because she was unsure what had happened.

Thankfully, it looked like some of the leaders had returned. They had done so with survivors from the Daisy faction, so she could continue her commentary about that instead.

Seeing that there were some people alive, Quinn had new hopes, and the anger he had inside him was starting to settle a little bit.

"Quinn, it really is you!" One of the females saw him but noticed that he looked a bit different. At least the air around him was a little different.

The women that had been saved, Quinn noticed that these were the ones he had given blood weapons. Though it looked like they no longer had blood weapons on them anymore.

The leaders explained to Quinn what they had seen so far. Jin, Sunny and Vincent. Then it was time to ask the girls themselves.

"Where do you think others will be, and what about Helen?" Quinn asked.

The group of women looked uncomfortable when they heard this question.

"Honestly, we're not sure, but they were fighting until the very end towards the base. After we lost the fight, we got split up and taken hostage there. So I think your best bet is to continue heading to the base."

Since it seemed like they didn't know much and the direction Quinn was going to head anyway, he thanked them.

"You guys will just need to hold out a little longer. I will place you in a safe place for now." Quinn said.

They looked nervous but trusted Quinn. Holding out his hand, he placed each of them in his shadow lock. So they wouldn't be able to get hurt, and so the leaders didn't have to look after them.

"You guys, continue looking through the Shelter and see if you can find survivors. Then meet me at the base." Quinn ordered.

"Don't you want us to come with you?" Jin asked. "As they said, I don't think there are any other survivors in the Shelter."

"No," Quinn replied. "Every second counts, and if there are those around that are injured, I won't be able to get to them. You guys being around won't help me take over the base any quicker. it quicker for me to deal with them, then let you."

Although what Quinn said was true, the real reason was, he believed that most of the Dalki remaining in the Shelter would be at the base. He wanted to be the one to kill every single one of them himself.

'Something…is changing inside the boy.' Vincent thought. 'But right now, it might be exactly what the humans need to win this war.'

*****

# Chapter 1394 - Untouchable (Part 2)
As Quinn had somewhat expected, humans weren't the only one watching the live broadcast, but he somewhat wanted the Dalki to see this. He remembered that back when he had been in Graham's lab, the Dalki leader had been watching the fight between Slicer and the others.

Right now, Graham was doing the same thing. He was still out on the field, fighting against the new generation of Dalki, but during one of the breaks, a Dalki had come out to make a report of what was going on. That there was something interesting he should see.

After finally getting a set of clothes that fit his new size, he had calmed down, and was happy to watch the footage. A lot of it he had missed, and now on the camera he could see Quinn walking towards the Daisy base.

"This…man." Graham grumbled. "He was also there when Slicer was defeated. This person…" The Dalki leader didn't say it out loud, but he had a feeling that this person was going to cause him a lot of trouble.

Just watching the video alone, he was walking on camera with so much confidence, confidence he had never seen before, even amongst the strongest of humans, and vampires. It reminded Graham of when he had first met the vampire known as Arthur.

'Let's see if you have the skills to back it.' Graham smiled.

———

After finding out that there could be survivors at the main base, Quinn decided to run ahead at full speed. The spaceship was easily able to keep up with the Vampire Lord, but they were wondering when he was going to slow down, the thing was, Quinn never did.

Two large doors could be seen up ahead, they looked reinforced and Quinn could even see a few Dalki guards on the outside. Not slowing down, Quinn leapt up in the air. He was moving too fast for the guards to react. Throwing both of his fists back, he threw them forward slamming into the door.

He powered his fists with the first stage of Qi, as much as possible, and the two doors went flying open, breaking off from their hinges and crashing into the base. As Quinn landed on the ground in front of what would have been the doors that were there before, he threw out two punches to the side of him.

An invisible force hit the two Dalki away, the third stage of Qi, throwing them off their feet. Ignoring whether they were alive or not, Quinn decided to head further into the base.

"Come on, let's get down from here! We have to follow him, we can't let this go to waste!" Bonny shouted.

"What about the Dalki? He didn't finish them off! What if they attack us?!" Void complained.

"Do you really think you have to worry about that? Isn't that pretty much the whole reason I'm with you guys?" Nate asked confidently, as he was already getting off from the ship that had landed in front of the base. He walked over to the Dalki Quinn had hit, and the reason why they were no longer moving was because they were dead.

Sure these were just one spiked Dalki, but finishing them off in one hit. If Nate had heard stories like this back when he had been in the academy he would have just treated it as some sort of propaganda, made up to raise morale.

"If there are any leftovers I can protect you." Nate claimed, punching his shield, but he had a feeling he wasn't going to have to use it.

When they entered the base, they could see that the two large doors that were around ten meters in height, had been knocked to the back of the entrance rooms and not just that, the room was filled with dead Dalki and Quinn was nowhere to be seen.

"Everyone, I hope you are seeing everything. Quinn Talen entered the base seconds ago and without much effort defeated two Dalki on the way in." Bonny reported.

"This has to be fake, right? Like a pre made video to make the Cursed leader seem stronger." Someone commented under the livestream.

"Why would they have that? Everyone is watching this right now, why would they make a fake video. We all know that the Cursed planet was actually attacked, and he even saw what he did when he landed. This is real." Another viewer, refuted.

The three of them continued to follow Quinn's tracks, which didn't seem to be too hard to do, as they just had to follow the trail of dead Dalki inside the base. They went up a set of giant stairs, and onto the second floor. Up top, another door had been destroyed, though smaller than the entrance one, which led into a long hallway.

In the hallway, countless Dalki could be seen killed, it looked like none of them were able to put up much of a fight, and the spikes on their back could be clearly seen. There were three spikes, two spikes all killed just as easily as the one spikes, and Graham was watching all of this as well.

"This, after just having come back from that place?!" Graham was beyond annoyed. "Who the hell is this person! I want all the information on him!"

Although Graham had originally followed Jim's plan, now that the original Jim was dead, the Dalki leader had started to adapt his own plans, believing he had made a better one than Jim himself. The Dalki had already evolved far beyond whatever their creator had predicted. So how, how could the vampires or the humans possibly have such an outlier like this?

Still, Graham calmed himself down, it was true that Quinn looked to be stronger than when he thought against Slicer, but he was just one person, and it was up against the old generation of weak low spiked Dalki. Even Graham himself could do something like this.

——

Finally, Quinn had reached the room he had been looking for. Here he could see three four spiked Dalki. It was the main meeting hall for the Daisy faction but it was open, filled with blood and teleporters in the back could be seen having already been destroyed.

What Quinn was more concerned about, was the fact that he could see another group of survivors, about six or so of them in total.

'I don't see her!' Quinn thought, a mix of anger and worry on his face.

These Dalki, unlike the rest, seemed to be somewhat aware that something was coming. However, it didn't matter to Quinn, this whole time there was something he hadn't used. Shadows started to grow from his feet and had covered the entire floor.

The Dalki, seeing this, tried to avoid it, but since they had filled the entire room there was nowhere for them to go and once it came into contact with their shadows, their movements slowed. A Dalki seeing this, concerned, had decided to grab a hostage, yet the shadow had just appeared in front of them blocking its attack and the next second, Quinn was seen coming through it, holding onto Dalki's arm.

"I'm going to borrow some energy from you." Quinn said activating the active skill of his gauntlet. All of the things he had obtained, all of the fight he had fought, was for this moment. It was then the hostages could see that this person, in front of the four spiked Dalki they wouldn't dare fight against, was untouchable.

——

"Come on, we have to hurry!" Bonny shouted, as the three of them did their best to catch up to Quinn. They came just in time to see the Cursed faction leader standing there with three four spiked Dalki dead on the ground.

"It looks like Quinn has managed to save more of the Daisy faction, and we have two of their leaders here!"

Quinn hadn't had the time to speak to the ones he had saved, but he had recognised both of Helen's sisters.

'If these two are alive, Helen should also be safe.' Quinn thought, but there was another thought in the back of his mind. Where was Helen and why wasn't she with her sisters.

Without realising it, Quinn had become somewhat obsessed with finding Helen. Maybe it was because he felt like the two of them never got to talk, or he never got to thank her for the Daisy faction's help. Or perhaps it was the giant worry at the back of his mind. It was because of this, he didn't ask if the others were okay.

"Where is Helen?" Quinn asked. Her two sisters pointed towards a door to their right.

"We last saw them take her there, it's the science lab of the Daisy faction." Peach answered.

The two girls stood up next to Quinn, and followed him as he walked towards the door, and Bonny and the others weren't far behind him. He pushed the doors open, and they had finally found Helen…

*****

# Chapter 1395 - Battle Of Daisy (Part 1)
Nearly the entire cursed faction was watching Bonny's live stream. It was exciting for them. They felt like it was payback for what they had lost and a display of the faction's power. However, for the Cursed faction's main leaders, for those involved in protecting the Daisy faction at the time, watching it was nail biting.

Sam had his jaws clenched as he watched everything play out, and every time they saw people dead on camera, he was reminded of the decision he had to make that day. Yet, the person who was finding it hardest to watch everything was none other than Layla.

She had bitten on her thumb so hard while watching the video clip that it was bleeding slightly. She didn't care though. Each time the camera caught some survivors, Layla was looking for one person in particular, yet so far, they hadn't appeared on the screen.

'Please…please…Helen, you can't have…you can't have died!' Layla thought, thinking back to what had happened that day, the day of the Dalki attack.

——

On the day of the attack on planet Daisy, Helen was standing tall on the Shelter walls staring outward. The original Dalki mothership that was on the planet had been destroyed by Quinn, so when they saw another one appear, alarm bells were ringing in her head.

'They haven't just sent that to intimidate us, and from the reports, it seems like the other groups are going to be under attack as well.'

"Peach, contact the Cursed faction, inform them that the Dalki has made their move, and inform everyone. Tell them to get ready for battle." Helen ordered.

Peach, her sister, knew that the Dalki ship moving was probably a big deal. The Daisy faction was strong, and even when they had been attacked multiple times in the past, the Daisy faction had successfully defended it with the people they currently had.

It was a Shelter that had never suffered from a beast attack, or from another faction attack before. It was one of the reasons why the Daisy faction was so feared. She knew that Helen would have defended the Shelter with all her power and would never call for help from the others unless she felt like it was absolutely necessary.

Not long after, and hundreds of pods could be seen coming from the mothership. It was more than the attack from before, and what was worse, they could hear the sound of rumbling. Almost instantly after landing, they weren't building a type of fortress like they usually would.

Instead, it seemed like all the Dalki were on the attack straight away. Surprisingly, standing outside the Shelter wall were the three sisters, along with a large group of around five thousand fighters.

This was the first force of the Daisy faction. Then on all sides of the walls, there was an additional one thousand members covering each side. Finally, inside the Shelter, there were another five thousand ability users ready to fight. At the same time, the rest of those inside were civilians.

The anti jammers were working, and the teleporters were still online to allow them to escape. The only problem was, there really wasn't anywhere for them to run to. At the moment, the other two Cursed faction planets were also under attack, and the Cursed ship was heading their way.

At the same time, although the Cursed ship was large, there was no way that they could house so many people on board. They were already close to their max capacity.

"If they get inside the Shelter, then hundreds…no thousands of lives will be lost. We need to do what we can to make sure they don't make it inside!" Helen ordered.

The large group of five thousand cheered and quickly split into three groups. Each one led by a sister team, and they spread out slightly, with the centre group being more forward. That's when they could see the hundreds and hundreds of Dalki running towards them.

'These Dalki…they look to have higher spikes than the last lot. I knew my feelings were right.' Helen thought.

Still, this was Daisy's planet, and it was designed for combat using their powers. As soon as the Dalki got within a specific range, several of the plants the Dalki stopped on exploded. Vines had grown from the ground, wrapping around their feet, thorns digging into their body.

Of course, there was also Helen's power, as she had several plants pop out from her seeds, firing at the Dalki getting close. On top of that, she ran in together with the combat team and swung her whip, constantly getting rid of them.

"We were once one of the factions considered to become one of the big four. We are no pushovers!" Helen shouted as she continued to fight Dalki after Dalki. Still, her main focus was trying to help those around her rather than killing the Dalki. Since they were fighting on their specially built terrain, they felt powerful.

There were minimal losses on their side, and the powers and fighters were able to support each other well. Once in a while, groups from the Shelter would come out as support and grab those that were more injured than others. Bringing them back to the Shelter for healing.

Although there were more Dalki than the last attack, it was the same for the Daisy faction, which now had support from the factions of the other planets. The reason why they were so willing to follow and help Helen was because she was out there on the field now.

She didn't stay behind, waiting for the enemy to get weak. No, she was fighting against the Dalki from the beginning, and a leader who led through actions was a very powerful thing to the people.

However, soon, a giant shadow would be cast above the entire Shelter. Something gigantic was coming out from the clouds above, and the second they saw it, Helen hated that her gut feeling was right.

For right now, there was another Dalki mothership, and it had decided to attack right from above. Looking out, Helen wondered if she had made a mistake or noticed the other mother ship moving, but it was still there.

Before they knew it, more pods started to come out from above, landing directly in the Shelter.

——

At the moment, on the cursed faction ship, Sam was taking in the reports that he was getting from multiple areas. He thought he might need to send help to the other factions but decided that helping the Cursed faction was the number one priority.

The reason he hadn't sent help through the teleporters immediately was because he was in the middle of deciding which planet needed more help than the others. He knew every second that passed would mean more lives lost, but this was important as well.

He didn't want another situation similar to before where Sil was unable to help in a fight. After analysing everything, Sam had decided to send groups to their respective planets and knew Daisy was in the most trouble.

"Alright, you three will be one group, head through the teleporters. Save as many people as you can, and show the Dalki that they messed with the wrong faction." Sam said.

The three nodded and stepped through the teleporters, and before they knew it, they had arrived in the Daisy faction.

——

Helen was still struggling with the fight outside, but she knew that she needed to go in and help. Those in the Shelter at the moment were the weakest, but just then, she had received a message.

"Don't worry, I've sent in three of the strongest Cursed faction members to help you," Sam said.

And Sam wasn't lying either. A Dalki was seen, ready to swing and grab one of the civilians fleeing, but before it could, something had whisked right in front of the Dalki and grabbed its hand.

A blonde-haired boy, who gave a tug and ripped the Dalki's arm off with his super strength, this was Sil. There was a martial arts expert not too far away, who was dealing with two Dalki at once. He lifted up his new shield allowing them to hit it, and the next second, they were blasted away. This was Nate.

Then finally, Qi filled arrows were seen moving around, hitting a Dalki in the eye and through its skull. The last person who was there to help was Layla. Knowing that these three were inside the Shelter, Helen believed she could fight outside peacefully.

Until a different coloured pod, a larger black pod with golden trimmings, had landed in the centre of the Shelter.

******

# Chapter 1396 - Battle Of Daisy (Part 2)
The second Dalki mothership had caused panic inside the Daisy Faction. The number of Dalki that had appeared where equal to the force that was attacking outside. Helen had never predicted this, which was why the strongest members from the Daisy Faction were currently fighting outside.

The other members were stationed on the wall. However, they understood that if they were to move from their position, it might make matters worse, which was why it was left to all those who were currently inside the Shelter. Although lately, there had seemed to be a rise in those that could deal and fight with the Dalki, this number was minuscule compared to the regular human population.

Inside the Shelter, there weren't many normal civilians with abilities that could go past that of level five; their beast gear wasn't even past that of the advanced level. Which meant, even if they were to team up and try their best to fight against a One Spiked Dalki, they would fail.

This fact was made clear in the first war; it didn't matter how much the humans outnumbered the Dalki; they just didn't have enough people with strong enough abilities that could deal with them.

This was why, when the Cursed Faction members were called, it was a big help to the Shelter. These weren't just any members of the Cursed Faction but some of the strongest. Sil was making quite the impact; he had made sure to take abilities that suited him the most.

The Cursed Faction didn't have any elemental abilities that he could use, which was what the Blade family were mostly taught to use, but Sil knew that. After missing out on the fight on Balde Island with the rest, all Sil had done was train.

His enemies were now gone, Hilston was no longer here, so Sil decided to put his powers to use in helping Quinn, to make sure that others who had been raised like him could continue to live, and to protect the Blade kids at all costs.

With this in his head, Sil started to train himself with a set of abilities, strength, speed, hardness, and more, and he was using all of this now to fight off the Dalki. With his great power, he was stronger than them; with his speed, he was faster than them, and his hardening skills even made it, so his skin was stronger than theirs.

Sil was bulldozing through, killing Dalki after Dalki, and they could see that this was a problem, and now he had their attention. The Dalki knew if they didn't get rid of this troublesome variable, they wouldn't complete their mission.

However, he wasn't the only troublesome one, nor was he the only one that had trained. Nate was able to charge in just as recklessly with the shield, and then there was Layla, who stood on top of a building, firing at the Dalki with her arrows, trying to save as many lives as possible.

Helen, who was out the front, had been getting these reports, and she was thankful; it looked like the Daisy Faction would be okay. Until…a large black and golden pod came down from the Dalki mothership.

The pod looked different compared to others, and the way it had left the ship was distinct as well. It was shot out with such extreme force and speed that it hardly had spent any time in the air before slamming into the ground.

The force it had struck the ground was done so powerfully, that a large crater was created, and fissures on the ground were created from where it had fallen. Buildings within half a kilometre that were in the range of impact started to fall and crumble, and the Dalki started to move towards this destroyed area.

Layla was about a good kilometre away from where the pod had landed, but she could see its direction from a distance. She had a feeling this wasn't good news, so she made a decision.

"Everyone, head to the base where the teleporters are, be prepared to move out, at any moment," Layla shouted, making her voice louder with the power of Qi.

Hearing the voice, the people had decided to comply, leaving their homes and heading away from the centre of the Shelter, while those who thought they were better fighters would stay as others went past.

The streets were a bit clearer now, and Layla had decided to jump down from the high building. Before she hit the ground, she used her telekenesis ability on herself, slowing down her movements and landing safely.

'My ability powers have improved as well.' She noted. 'When I was human, it was limited to level two, and when I turned, I didn't bother trying to improve them so much. Now, I'm no longer restricted by the limits I had before. Thanks to Leo, I am able to realize this.'

On the ground, Nate had just finished dealing with a Dalki and ran over to the middle of the street between several buildings where Layla was. Up ahead, they could see the Dalki had gathered around the strange large pod. They were stood at the edge of the crater that was a few meters deep.

"What do you think that is?" Nate asked.

"Probably something similar to Slicer." Layla guessed. "The attack seems to be still happening outside, and I haven't received any report from Sam. I imagine other places might be under attack like this. Worst case though, the people should travel through the teleporters to one of the other planets."

"I think you might be right," Nate replied. "If Sam sent us, the big guns to this place, then they must be really in trouble."

Layla glanced at Nate for referring to himself and the others as the big guns, but that was just him, and it was then that the others saw someone else running straight past them at great speed, which was none other than Sil.

He continued to run forward and had entered where the Dalki and the large crater were. He didn't halt and continued to run right past the Dalki; none of them were able to catch him. At that moment, the door to the pod started to open. Steam had come out as the door opened wide.

"We don't need to call Quinn because he has us!" Sil shouted, jumping. He threw out his fist fast, and the outside of it could be seen hardening into a type of metallic material. With super-strength, speed, and hardening, Sil was delevering one of the strongest punches he had done before.

It was then that he saw his fist didn't strike; rather, something reached out and grabbed it. For a second, the strength gave in, and he could feel his hand losing momentum, but then a force pushed out, pushing Sil's hand back as well. Sil's feet were now touching the ground, and his other hand was quickly grabbed by whatever was in the pod.

The next second, he felt a force pushing him across the ground and the Dalki in the pod slowly stepped out.

"You are a strong one, I recognize you; you were there when Slicer died!" the Dalki shouted. He was covered in clothes and had five spikes on his back. He was none other than Graham.

"No one interferes! I need to fight this one!" Graham shouted, and soon a few arrows came for his head, which he quickly titled down, letting it hit his hard-scaled head. The arrows hit the target but snapped upon contact, even with the added power of Qi.

Looking up, Graham saw two more people standing at the edge of the crater, but Graham just smiled at this fact.

"All of you're going to help me evolve." Graham sneered. He then lifted his leg and kicked Sil by his side.

Sil, seeing this, tried to harden his side in time, but he was still sent flying and into the ground. The next second, Graham started running towards the other two.

"Back me up!" Nate said, running forward. He hadn't held out his shield yet; he thought that would be too obvious but needed to time it right. The Dalki was faster than him being a five spike, so he needed to predict the next attack. Still, he had gained extra strength and speed due to the power of the demon-tier weapon.

'He's pulled back his arm. Now!' Nate thought, throwing his shield out in front of him, but he never felt the attack against his shield and instead saw Graham standing there.

"You think I don't know what that shield does?" Graham smirked, "I was the one that created it."

Looking up, Nate could see just how large and muscular of a Dalki Graham was. Through the tight-fitting clothes, one could truly see how great beings they were, and just like with Sil, he lifted his leg to kick Nate aside.

Just then, an object came flying from the side and hit Graham from the side. It knocked him like a heavy truck, making him slightly fall off-balance and go down to one knee. Regaining his composure, Graham saw the boy he had kicked before holding a bow, but not on his own. Beside him was a brown-haired girl.

"Using our two abilities together was a good idea." Layla smiled. "For some reason, after the last five spikes, this one isn't that scary."

# Chapter 1397 - Battle Of Daisy (Part 3)
Looking at the ground, Graham was wondering what had hit him. The truth was that he wasn't hurt and could still move; he was just in a shock. It had been a long time since anything had succeeded in knocking off his balance. And he found out that of all things, what caused this was a simple arrowhead.

'The arrowhead couldn't pierce my skin, but that force, was it from the girl before? But how?' Graham thought.

Layla's arrows were able to work somewhat this time, compared to last time, due to the person who actually had fired the arrow. That was none other than Sil himself. Out of the multiple abilities he carried with himself, one of them could magnify any object's weight.

Using this, he made the arrowhead several times heavier. Then with another ability, he could accelerate any object he touched regardless of weight, which was exactly what he had used on the arrow. Lastly, Layla empowered it with Qi and ensured that it stayed on the right path.

She knew it would be almost impossible to move the arrow with her ability. They needed to get a perfect aim, and Sil wasn't exactly the best when using a bow and arrow. When the arrow had hit Graham, the force was too strong, and it had easily knocked him off balance.

However, although that trick had worked this time, they knew it wouldn't work again. Graham immediately stood up and felt it was best to deal with the troublesome ones first. He had wholly ignored Nate, deeming him as a person who could do him no harm even with his strongest attacks and headed straight for the other two.

They tried to fire multiple arrows, but Graham was able to jump and avoid them with his great speed each time.

"Layla, it's not going to work anymore. Let me take care of him!" Sil said as he hardened his fists and ran forward. He threw a punch towards Graham, but it completely missed; not only that, but Graham had wrapped his tail around Sil's arm and then slammed him onto the ground.

"You are from that damned Balde Family!" Graham said. "Even your whole family was only just able to take out Slicer, so what makes you think you can take care of me!"

Graham punched the ground where Sil lay, and Sil somehow managed to harden his stomach. Still, even then, the blow was so strong, his whole body sunk into the ground, making the crater around them even deeper. Sil spat out a bit of blood. He tried to get up but was hit again and again.

'No! I need to do something!' Layla was alarmed.

Strangely, there was a lot of negative smog in the air, and it was mostly coming off from Graham. Using this to her advantage, Layla didn't waste any time consuming it all in.

'In this situation, only one form will help us in this fight.' Layla thought, and almost immediately, the horns started to grow from her head, her teeth began to become pointed, and her eyes glowed red.

'Come on, stay in control; I have to stay in control!' Was the strongest thought in Layla's mind right now, and she had succeeded.

Graham was still in the middle of hitting Sil. With each hit, Graham seemed to be getting more frustrated, and it was all because Sil hadn't died yet. He didn't even have this much trouble killing fellow Dalki, so how was a mere human able to stay alive even after so many kicks?

With all six of his high-level abilities, Sil had a strong defence in his hardening abilities. Still, even with that, he was getting hurt from Graham's punches.

'How was Hilston able to fight against that other Dalki for so long? Is it because I'm still weak?' Sil knew he had to find a way to get out of this state but could not do anything.

In the next instant, Graham found himself being hit by a strange black ball. Spiritual chains were gripping on him, restricting his movements. However, even with their great power, the spiritual chains that had hardly failed Layla till this point, Graham was still able to move.

Still, Layla had somewhat expected this; she just needed Graham's movements to be slowed down slightly. At that moment, a blue flame formed out of nowhere. The second it touched Sil, he felt himself growing slightly stronger; a green flame touched his body, healing his wounds, and on top of that, there was another energy rising in him.

Layla was transferring her Qi energy into Sil. Sil hadn't learned the art of Qi; despite Nate wanting to teach it to him, Sil had decided to focus on improving his combat skills and use of different abilities.

With Layla, this didn't matter since she could give Qi through her ability to whoever she wished.

The next punch came towards Sil, and he was able to move away, hitting Graham's hand, causing it to skim right past Sil's head.

"You Damn lizard!" Sil shouted, using both his legs to kick Graham in the stomach, throwing him up in the air. He wasn't the only one in the air, as Layla was right behind with her sword. Striking at Graham's back, she hoped it would do something, but they just heard a loud clang as it bounced off his large scales.

Spinning his body, Graham now turned his attention towards Layla.

"You seem to be an annoying one as well!" Graham snarled.

Realizing that she had somehow been able to buff the boy Graham was punching just moments ago, Layla braced herself holding the sword.

Although the sword could block abilities, Qi, and other things, it didn't seem to work against physical strength, which the Dalki are best known for.

"Sprout!" She heard a voice, and plants started to appear seemingly out of nowhere, all turning towards Graham and Layla; at the same time, Nate was seen behind her, and he had covered the two of them in shadow.

Immediately, all of the plants started to fire towards Graham. As the spikes hit his body, multiple explosions went off one after another constantly. The spikes didn't stop, and Graham eventually landed on the ground.

Once Layla and Nate had landed and were far away enough, Nate placed his shadow away, and they could see who had come to their aid. On the other side was Helen, and she was standing next to Sil.

After seeing the strange pod land in the centre of the Shelter, Helen knew that it meant big trouble. Since her sisters were doing well dealing with the Dalki that were coming from the front, she decided to check in at the Shelter to find this situation.

"Do you think the four of us can take him down?" Helen asked, unsure.

Before Sil could answer, small stones suddenly flew out from the explosion dust and started to hit the plants one by one. Each time it hit them, the plants would wither instantly. Then, these stones were thrown towards Sil, who caught them, preventing them from hurting Helen.

On the other end, they were blocked by Nate's shield. Now that the explosions had stopped, they could see Graham standing there, some of his clothes slightly scorched from the attack, but still, through his hard skin, not a single attack had hurt his body.

The four of them had used nearly everything they could, and Sil was the strongest among them, yet even now, they still hadn't been able to put a scratch on Graham.

"Hey, I have an idea. You gave some of your power to Sil earlier, right? Well, give him as much power as you can. At the same time, try to trap the enemy with those chains like you did last time. If I use my shadow, I can block one attack from him, but that's it, and it will completely dry my MC cells." Nate explained, telling her they only had one shot.

Layla knew Nate had a plan, but she just didn't know whether or not Sil would understand the plan either. Lifting up his shield, Nate punched it a few times, and both he and Sil nodded as if they understood what they were about to do.

"Now!" Nate shouted.

Layla spread out her arms at that moment, and a dozen of the black spiritual balls had surrounded Graham; it was impossible for him to avoid. Seeing them and knowing what it did last time, Graham was cautious about touching them.

Regardless, it didn't exactly seem like he could get out if he didn't touch them, and he decided to pick a direction and move ahead. Two of them touched him, and the chains immediately wrapped around his feet. Using her powers, Layla then moved all of them towards him.

Layla used multiple black balls at once, so the effect of the chains was stronger, and now Graham's movements were somewhat restricted.

Helen had dropped many seeds on the ground, and immediately they started to sprout, firing off the spikes from before, causing multiple explosions as they hit Graham's body.

She knew that they wouldn't do any damage, but that wasn't why they were being used; it was because they needed a smokescreen. To her side, Sil could feel his strength rising beyond what it was before. This was because of Layla.

At that moment, though, they could see a fist moving so fast that the smoke had been blown away and a punch was heading right towards Sil's face, but a shadow had appeared, at that moment, between the two of them, blocking Graham's punch.

Seeing Sil's punch coming towards Graham, he was unafraid; just like before, these weak punches would do nothing to him, but the punch was never aiming for him in the first place. Sil had used one of Graham's legs to jump up as he threw out his hardened fist as strong as he could, and a ringing clang was heard.

What it had hit was the Demon-tier shield that Nate was currently holding up. Sil's momentum, the strength of his attack at that moment, was doubled.

"There is more than one way to use this thing!" Nate shouted as the shield lit up was pointed towards Graham.

So far, none of the attacks the group had done had worked on the five spiked Dalki. The situation was beginning to feel similar to when they faced Slicer; however, Sil didn't have stronger abilities, unlike before.

If they couldn't hurt Graham now, then how else could they hurt him. The most important thing to do was to increase their attack power. The idea had occurred to Nate when he had blocked the small stone from Graham. He could feel the energy that was collected in the shield.

That's when he realized why does the attack have to be from the enemy? Which was what eventually brought them to the situation they were in right now. Layla almost collapsed on the ground again. This was because of Qi Depletion. She had already partially given her Qi to Sil before, and she had given him, even more, this time.

The problem was, Sil's power probably would have increased by far more if he had some idea how to use Qi himself in order to power up his attacks, but because he didn't, it meant that the charge was only partially increased.

Nevertheless, even though Layla had used most of her energy, there was still one more thing she needed to do. She could feel her body reverting to normal as the energy around her was disappearing; however, she threw out several more black balls towards Graham at her last strike. Wrapping him in chains once more while Layla finally was back to her ordinary self again.

Now, with Graham's movement somewhat restricted, the group gained confidence that the attack could work. The shield lit up, causing it to shine blue. Nate gritted his teeth and held onto the shield as hard as he could.

Then, a large blast of blue energy came from the shield. It was too strong for Nate to handle, and he could feel himself being pushed back, skidding across the ground, until someone came for support, holding him from behind.

It was Sil. Supporting Nate from behind as the latter continued to fire the energy in the direction of Graham, and a few seconds later, the assault finally had ended. Still on guard, they quickly went to look at the condition of Graham and found that almost half of his body was missing.

The chains hadn't held out, and he was able to move somewhat from the attack; the right side of his body was missing, and almost half his chest was gone. Blood was oozing, spreading across the surface.

'Damn it, if only I could have held onto the shield a bit more, then maybe I could have directed it and finished him off, but he's nearly dead now, we can do this. I can get Sil to hit the shield again, and we can use this as an attack.'

'As long as we can hurt the Dalki, we can win this fight!' Nate thought.

Although they knew that Dalki got stronger the more they were injured, this looked like a critical blow, and judging from Graham's condition, it was.

However, he suddenly leapt up in the air, jumping out from the crater-like area even in this condition. Sil, seeing this, was ready to run after him, but the other Dalki, who had been watching everything from the sidelines, moved and stood in his way.

"Wait, Sil! Take the shield; it's useless in my hands right now. You're the only one who can fight!" Nate said, handing it over to him. He knew that it was pretty likely that Sil wouldn't be able to hurt Graham, and they needed to finish him off somehow. Working together had worked once, but now it was all up to Sil.

However, in that short timeframe, they had allowed Graham to do something they should have never allowed. Opening his mouth wide, he had bit the Dlaki's head off next to him, consuming it in an instant.

Then, the Dalki to his left, he bit their head off as well. Within seconds, his body began to heal on the spot. The green blood stopped, and his limbs started to regenerate.

'This…is bad…' Helen gulped. Seeing this, it was time for her to make the tough decision.

"Peach. Inform everyone, I want everyone to get out of the Shelter now! Head to one of the other planets, just tell them to leave this place, and you guys as well. We can no longer protect this place!" Helen decreed.

She had the same bad feeling in her guts which she had earlier. She figured that not only was eating his fellow Dalki healing Graham, but most likely, he was getting stronger as well.

Sil, using his speed, had caught up to him. Graham's other arm was still in the middle of healing. Sil then proceeded to hit the shield powering it up with his own attack, but before he could, Graham had moved from his spot and grabbed onto Sil's arm.

"Not again," Graham smirked.

Kicking Sil in the stomach, he sent him back to the crater with all the others. Feeling the kick, Sil knew that Helen's hunch was right. Graham's attacks had gotten stronger, and he was even faster!

If it weren't for the buff he got from the demon tier shield, then perhaps Sil wouldn't be able to get up again.

What the others didn't know was that Graham wasn't done yet. As his arm had finished healing, he looked up to the sky.

"I would have never thought, in a place like this, I would be injured in such a state," Graham said. "I can't take any more chances, and I won't underestimate you."

It was then that something started to happen to Graham. His body started to change slightly. The Dalki was already large, but he could be seen growing even larger; his face began to stick out a little, and his teeth sharpened more than before.

Strangely, the scales on his hand were turning slightly, changing into something else.

"All of you, get out of here!" Helen shouted. "While he's transforming, Sil can use his super-speed to get you all out of here."

The others knew that this was a lost fight and that they could do nothing else, and it looked like Graham was about to get even stronger.

"Don't tell me you're thinking of staying here!" Layla shouted.

To which Helen responded with a slight nod.

"I will slow him down; I still have a lot of tricks up myself, so don't worry about me," Helen said. "But once he finishes transforming, there's a good chance he might even be able to catch up to Sil."

It was then that Layla noticed that the vines that had covered the Shelter walls, the plants that were placed all over the Shelter had begun to move towards Helen; it seemed like she really did have some sort of plan.

Hearing Helen's words, Sil, decided to grab Nate under his arm and quickly zoomed towards Layla as well.

"What are you doing? Put me down! If we leave her here, she's going to die!" Layla shouted.

"And if we all stay here, we are all going to die!" Sil said; he looked over to Helen one more time, and she nodded.

It was then that Layla pulled out her sword; if she tapped it against Sil, she was sure that he wouldn't be able to use his ability, and that way, they would have no choice but to fight. Helen didn't know what the girl was trying to do but felt that Layla might do something reckless.

"Stop, don't do something stupid like that! How in the world did I lose out to you." Helen shook her head. "I don't know what he sees in you, but he should have picked me. Do you remember the bet when we had that fight? Whoever won can request something from the other, right? Well, you owe me a favour, and I'm going to call in that favour right now. Leave this place and make him happy."

The strength in Layla's arms started to give after hearing these words, and tears began to flow down her face. Without wasting any more time, Sil left, and Layla could only see Helen, bravely standing there surrounded by plants, about to go against the strongest Dalki in existence.

That was the last time that Layla would see Helen.

# Chapter 1399 - Helen's Fate
You can read the story for free at LatestNovel.Net or NovelGreat.Net

Reminiscing about the events that transpired that day, Layla was praying that Helen was safe. Quite a few Daisy fighters were saved, and Layla noticed a pattern with those still alive. They were the strongest members of Daisy.

If that really was the case, there was a good chance that Helen was alive as well. Her hands were held tightly together, shivering as she saw Quinn open the doors and the cameras with Bonny and Void rush in behind him.

Finally, she would get an answer of what had happened after they had left her that day.

"What…have they done!" Quinn was stunned at the scene in front of him and almost fell to his knees. Currently, they were in what looked like a lab. It wasn't a lab like the other bases had. Usually, they focused on improving weapons, designing mechs, perhaps even trying to create new weapons; however, here, the whole place was just filled with broken vases and plants all over the place.

Soon, Helen's sisters rushed in behind, and in an instant, tears started to roll down their faces; they couldn't even take another step forward. They fell to their knees beside Quinn, who stood motionless.

"Look away; we can't film this," Bonny said, making Void put the camera down. It was important for them to film and update people on the situation, but a certain amount of respect was obliged when filming the fallen.

Eventually, Quinn walked forward into the lab and finally went to the wall, where Helen was practically stuck. Her body looked to be flattened on the wall, as if she had been squashed onto there, her own flesh acting like glue.

It was easy to identify her because most of the front of her body was intact; although she had no clothes on, her body appeared naked with several holes all over the bare skin. The worst part of it all, though, was how skinny and frail she looked.

As if she wasn't fed, left there to starve, barely left alive. While at the same time, the blood had been drained out of her, leaving her in such a state. Then, the strangest thing of all were some of the plants.

The plants had escaped from their glass experiment jars, seemed to have eventually grown, and were starting to feed off of Helen's body. Around her legs, there were even several roots attached.

It was an unnatural phenomenon, to say the least.

'I can't hear anything.' Quinn thought. 'There is no heartbeat… I can't think of any way to save her…how did all this happen?'

"Let's cut to something else," Bonny said in a low voice as they left the rooms and instead decided to film the survivors who were standing outside. Bonny was hoping she could help in some way and get a clearer picture of what had supposedly happened. At the same time, Quinn just stood in the room, looking at Helen; he didn't touch her, he didn't do anything, but just stood there with Helen's sisters sobbing in the background.

"Do you think he'll be okay?" Void wondered as they headed back into the main base hall.

"I don't know, whatever happened, it seems like the two of them are close. I've never seen him act like this." Bonny replied. "Usually, anger, sadness, or something else overcomes them, but Quinn, he wasn't displaying any of those things, and sometimes the people that act this way have the worst reaction possible."

After interrogating the survivors, they found out that the Dalki were collecting blood from all the survivors once in a while. They didn't know what they were doing with it or how they were using it. They also claimed that they had seen Dalki enter the room that Helen was in several times, coming out with blood-filled tubes.

However, there was quite a clear difference in treatment between them. Dalki had fed the other survivors, and they were even allowed to stay together, but for Helen… they could only imagine that during that whole time, the Dalki only drained blood from her until her current state.

After some time, the leaders started to return to the base where Quinn was, and they had brought along a few more survivors, but not many numbers. In total, they had gathered around another twenty or so, and that was between all the leaders.

Void and Bonny made sure to film all of them walking together. Getting a clear look at their faces, and that's when she realized something.

"My gosh, all of these people, they're so handsome and pretty," Bonny unknowingly spoke aloud, and it seemed like the viewers agreed to this.

"Are all V like this? I mean, I guess not; there are some people I saw that were V's that looked quite normal."

"If all V's looked like this, then we would have to start suspecting every good-looking person."

At the same time, there was something else that couldn't be displayed through the camera. It was something only those who were present at the scene could feel - The overwhelming presence each of them carried; the V's had a sense of importance when walking as if they owned the land they stepped on.

"Where is his majes…I mean Quinn Talen?" Muka asked, stepping forward. Everyone looked towards the door of the other room, where Quinn would be. Bonny and Void followed behind, hoping to witness whatever might transpire next.

Upon entering the lab, they all stood next to each other and just looked towards Quinn with their heads down. Not a single one of them said a word and just waited. How much time had passed, no one was sure.

Even those watching on camera felt strange, as they knew they couldn't say much or poke fun at the situation.

Eventually, Quinn turned around and could see all the leaders. However, he seemingly ignored their presence and instead walked to the two sisters who were still sobbing on the ground.

"Ivy… and Peach, right?… I see you cared a lot for Helen." Quinn said. "Please tell me… what should I do?"

This was unexpected; for all things they expected Quinn to say, he was asking them what he should do. A strong person like him was asking for their help.

Wiping the tears away, Peach, the eldest of the two, stood up.

"Please, she was our sister; let us take her off the wall and give her a befitting farewell before you do anything."

Then, Ivy stood up as well, grabbing her sister's hand to help her up, she gripped tightly, and both of the sisters looked at each other and nodded. Then at the same time, the two of them spoke to him.

"And, Quinn, please, kill them, please help us kill whoever did this to our sister!" They shouted and started crying again.

It didn't take Quinn long to answer.

"So that's what I need to do. To let Helen rest in peace, I have to kill the person who did this to her. Then that's exactly what I will do. I promise… I promise I will get rid of the Dalki before I even think about resting."

With those words said, Bonny thought that it was time to end the live stream, at least for now. It was a good introduction to the Cursed Faction, and it had finished with Quinn making a promise to the whole world.

Still, Bonny and Void were instructed to remain in the Shelter for now, as they felt there was more to this story still, and the two sisters had something they wished to speak to Quinn before they began to bring Helen off the wall.

"There is something you should see, Quinn." Peach said. "When the Dalki started to attack the other Cursed Faction planets, Helen made every single person make a video. It was a video that was meant to be sent to whoever they wished after their death."

"It was for their loved ones to receive a last message. You see, the videos that were to be made even included us as leaders, and we're the only family Helen has, so she had already said everything she wanted to speak to us, but she still had made a video, and it was her wish that if she were to die, the video would be sent to you.

"Please… watch the video whenever you can."

Quinn nodded and instructed the leaders to stay on standby and aid in anything the sisters wanted help with. At the same time, those survivors had been sent back to the planet Sam was currently on. This was all done on the same day the Cursed Faction had reclaimed the Daisy Planet.

While the sisters and the leaders remained here, for now, not leaving, Quinn decided to head to the office of the Daisy Faction before doing anything else. Surprisingly the place was in good shape. There was no reason for the Dalki to destroy all the buildings in the first place, and an office wasn't important to them.

Here he could see several beautiful flowers, still full of life in the room, and windows that naturally let the light into the room. Then, there was the seat that she would sit on. Quinn had come here because he was finally ready, ready to watch the video that Helen had left for him.

Just what message had Helen left, Quinn couldn't help but wonder.
