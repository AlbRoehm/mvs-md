# Chapter 1600: The Bounty
As Quinn had stated, flying through the air was a lot calmer than before, and he had even chosen not to go at his full speed, no matter how much he was tempted to test the limits. Still, Minny was having a great time as she grinned while her small hair waved back.

Yet, there was one person that wasn't enjoying it at all.

"I'm really going to be sick," Lucia said as she tilted her head towards Jessica, still hanging on.

"We really have to land this thing now. Besides, I was part of the Earth's Vampire Corps unit, so I don't really know where the base is!" Jesica had to shout due to the wind's rustling sound, although Quinn could hear well either way.

In the end, Quinn noticed that they were entering a suburban area. It looked pretty calming, as the streets were filled with red and orange lights. People were outside, eating at street vendors on the roads, laughing, and drinking.

It was hard to tell if the little place was having some sort of festival, but one thing was clear: it was peaceful. Seeing a large hill that overlooked the small town, they landed on it. The others stretched and exercised a bit to get the normal feeling back while Lucia had gone to spill her guts out.

"Is it okay for us to enter the town? The humans have those rings, and I'm worried we might cause a panic," Quinn asked.

Jesica glanced at Lucia, wondering if she was going to be okay. The two of them had grown quite close to each other on this trip for more reasons than one. Both of them were outsiders in this group, and somewhat going along with the situation was just one of the many reasons.

Seeing that her new friend had finally stopped throwing up, Jessica was at peace of mind again.

"The current land we are on is meant to be the Vampire Corps's territory. So you should only see vampires and humans here." Jessica answered. "As we get closer to the base, there will be more vampires, vampire families that aren't part of the corps but live in the current area. So there shouldn't be a problem at all; as for the corps' base, it will be easy when we spot it. I thought if we headed into the territory, we might see it, but the area is more hilly and mountainous than I thought.

"So it will be easier if we just ask one of the people here."

It all sounded well and good, but of course, Quinn couldn't help but worry. Perhaps he was just over worrying because of the threat of war that used to be looming over their heads and then being in the war. Now that there was no war, was he making up imaginary enemies, or were people, including Logan, really after him?

When they eventually entered the town, they could see it was just as busy as it was above, and being here in person, it looked more alive. The people were dressed in some sort of one-piece outfits that covered their whole body as they enjoyed themselves.

At the same time, they noticed that there were plenty of Travellers in the area as well. This was because every town and city, no matter how small, had a travellers centre. In fact, Quinn could even see the locked large wall in the distance.

One would have to show their traveller ID to be let out into the open area where beasts roamed. Although, to Quinn's knowledge, there were no beasts on Mars unless they somehow started to appear here or the humans had done something.

Regardless, since there were Travellers in the street, Quinn had to believe that there would be beasts as well.

"This place is so pretty, the lights look so nice, and the drink they are drinking is making the people act like children." Minny pointed out a few drunken men who were dancing.

"Yes, Minny, that drink makes people into children, so you don't need to drink it; otherwise, it will just make you younger," Peter replied in a serious voice.

When walking, they didn't stop at any restaurants or places because they were looking for something, or someone, to be more precise. They had passed a few vampires, but they didn't seem to want to mingle and that's when they finally saw their first vampire that smiled towards them. It was a female dressed in the same one-set outfit as the others. She was calmly chatting away to other humans.

It was nice to see this; nice to see vampires and humans getting along.

"Should we ask her where the corps area is?" Jessica wondered.

Quinn didn't reply, and she wondered why that was.

"Haven't you noticed?" Quinn replied. "Ever since we came here, although the general people haven't been looking at us so strangely, the Travellers, they have been staring at us."

It was something that had gone entirely over Jessica's head, and honestly, she didn't see what the big deal was. Travellers would always look at vampires strangely.

'Wait, that is a little strange. The people are fine with vampires here; we just saw it, so why are they looking at us? Is it because we are strangers? Do we look so out of place? No, that can't be it.'

"They're following us as well," Peter mentioned. "Which makes me think they may be the extra people you talked about before."

The group continued to move, ignoring this fact, and decided not to approach the vampire in front of them. Truthfully they were just following Quinn's lead, and he decided for now that if they were after him, they quite possibly would think that every vampire they conversed with was helping them.

In the end, the others could see it as well. Quinn didn't imagine things, and some of the travellers weren't even hiding the fact that they were looking at them strangely, even pointing and speaking to them about it.

"If it's only the Travellers acting this way, maybe we should head to the travellers centre here and see for ourselves," Lucia suggested.

———

The group had entered the travellers centre, which wasn't too busy. After all, it was quite late in the night. There wouldn't be many trying to take an assessment or hand in their quest, but the Travellers around them reacted with sudden gasps when they noticed the group.

Walking around, Quinn and the others were on guard for what could happen at any moment. Some of the travellers inside the centre even looked frightened, which confused Quinn a bit, until he heard a small voice.

"Hey…look, it's the fake you!" Minny pointed in a direction, still sitting on top of Peter's head.

When walking over to see what Minny was pointing at, they saw a giant digital screen. Each of their images, all apart from Minny, all with a similar bounty: money enough to allow any of the travellers around them to live several lifetimes over with no worries at all.

"What…what is this?!" Jessica said, slapping her forehead in disbelief, "Why…who…who even has this much amount of money?"

For a second, she even thought about turning herself in for this amount of money. Either way, it looked like the group figured out why the other Travellers were looking this way towards them.

'This is troublesome; I can only think of one person who would have the power to do this, but why try so hard for us…strangers.' Quinn thought. 'Anyway, I'm glad Minny hasn't been put on this as well. Either way, for Peter and me, we can just change our appearance when we wish, but Peter can only create one mud mask. The girls, now they have been dragged into this whole mess because of us.

'With this amount of money, high-ranking travellers are sure to make their move. No one has done so far because of the amount of money. They must have assumed that we are either dangerous or strong to have such a huge bounty, and in a town like this.'

Listening carefully, it was then that Quinn could hear some calls being made. It seemed like the travellers were possibly talking to their higher-up friends.

"Let's get out of this town quickly; we'll find the Corps area ourselves," Quinn said, walking towards the exit, but was wondering if that was even a good idea now. As soon as they exited out of the door, Quinn was ready to use his wings.

But just then -

"Hey, you guys!" A person called out to them.

Up ahead, by the traveller centre's other entrance, they saw the female vampire from earlier.

"That bounty, it's on your head because they figured it out, right?" Quietly, she ran over to Quinn's side and whispered. "It's because you're part of the red vampires, right? Don't worry, I am too, and I can help you."

Pulling up her dress, she revealed part of her thigh, and there was a red marking of a single eye with wings on it.

******

# Chapter 1601: The Red Vampires
The Red Vampires. Quinn knew little about them from his talks with the others. They are one of the three groups of vampires that were around in the current time of the world and were one of the reasons why vampires had gotten so much hate from humans.

It was said that these vampires were known for attacking humans, either to turn the latter or kill them. Quinn didn't know whether these vampires were a branch of the thirteen families who believed vampires were a superior race compared to humans and should rule them or were part of Laxmus's group. Maybe even a mix of both.

However, seeing the symbol that Quinn had noticed on a few items and others before made him think.

'This symbol is similar to the one Laxmus had, right? Is this a marking? Is that how Laxmus was able to gain extra strength? It was clear what he had turned that day into something beyond that of a vampire…and I remember what he said was strange.'

'Either this marking is something that these red vampires have just chosen to have on their bodies, or she might have been marked. Meaning she has a closer connection towards a celestial being. If that's the case, maybe there is something bigger behind these Red vampires. It could just be a god that is tricking them all with a fake goal so that he could get stronger in the process.'

'Sounds about right to me.' Ray replied. 'The question is how strong has this apparent god become during the time you were asleep? Remember, you have just become a celestial being and are only at the first level. Unless you are willing to create some followers and make them follow your condition, the only other way is…'

'To kill the other god's dedicated followers and absorb their energy.'

Looking at the vampire in front of him, Quinn could tell by the aura around her body. She honestly didn't see them as a threat and even believed that they were their alley. It could only be because of the bounty. What other reason would there be to put such a large bounty on one's head unless they were part of the red vampires?

Then begged the other question. Shouldn't she do something to confirm Quinn's identity if he was a red vampire? Was Quinn now supposed to show his symbol to her to prove that they were part of the same group, or was it something only high ranking members had?

'What I'm more worried about is what is or is a red vampire doing in this place? Are they planning an attack on this village? If so…it would be in my best interest to stop them. Perhaps it can be as easy as allowing them to take me to their leader and stopping him, putting an end to this red vampire mess.'

Eventually, Quinn decided to answer with the most suitable option to his situation.

"We are not red vampires," Quinn answered. "Not yet anyway but we wish to be. We had a small scuffle on one of the Graylash planets, and ever since, we have been on the run. We just found out about the large bounties now, and it looks like we messed with someone we shouldn't have."

Quinn thought this little excuse or act should be good and vague enough to satisfy their questions.

The female vampire looked the group up and down, and there was only one thing that wouldn't quite fit their group, that was Lucia. She was clearly smelt like a human but also had a bounty on her head for some reason.

"I see; if what you say is true, then come join us...though not all of you can join, but, yeah, we are always looking for those that are happy to join our cause, but there are also those that wish to try their best to hamper us. There are too many of you to introduce at once. If all goes well, I promise the Red vampires will do their best to protect you; we always look after our kind. That's what being part of the red vampires is all about." The woman answered.

Looking at the others, Quinn wondered what the best choice in front of him was. Who could he bring with him, and how they would split up the group for a short time, they would be away. After discovering more about the red vampires and their plans, he would reunite with them again.

"Jessica," Quinn said. "Why don't you come along with me? Peter, make sure Minny and Lucia are safe at all costs. I am trusting you."

With the bounty on their heads, he was a little worried, but for some reason, he felt like Jessica, another vampire that knew more about the situation, would be a better option in this case rather than Peter.

Yet, he needed someone strong enough to protect the others if anything happened to them. Minny also had almost blown his cover several times, so bringing her wasn't a good idea.

"Very well, follow me, you two, and we can introduce ourselves and talk on the way."

As the two groups split from each other, Minny looked like tears were about to come out from her eyes. She had grown attached to Quinn, and saw Peter like an uncle. Peter gave a look as if to say that Quinn didn't have to worry. But of course, he would be worried about them.

While walking, they had found out a few things. The vampire that they were currently following was named Hannah. She explained that she had been in this town for a while now, not just her, but a few others were with them as well.

They were living here among the humans for years. This made Quinn wonder if certain humans had gone missing. Perhaps these red vampires worked in secret, taking them out slowly. Still, it wasn't something he could straight up ask.

Eventually, Hannah went into one of the small shops and pulled out robes that were of the same design as what the others on the street were wearing, except for one thing: these had hoodies as well.

"It would be best to cover up now that you are wanted. I can't wait to hear what you guys did to get a bounty of that size on your head." Hannah smiled.

They took the robes, covered themselves, and followed Hannah along. Honestly, she didn't talk much about the red vampires and just went on about how lovely the town was, which was a little confusing for Quinn, but he decided not to rush and take one step at a time.

"How many of you are there?" Quinn asked.

"In this town, there are a total of five of us, but more will be coming soon, so you are just in luck." She replied.

Although, initially, Quinn actually meant about the whole of the red vampires, thinking he might get a number. The vampire settlements were never large in numbers, but they could be in a completely different state with no restrictions on their population anymore.

Eventually, the three of them had arrived at what looked like an entrance to a cave. They were away from the busy parts of town and could see the lights off in the distance, and no one seemed to have followed them.

When heading inside, Quinn could hear the sound of talking that soon stopped. Their footsteps were quiet, so it was apparent that they were approaching.

"I have a guest, so please be on your best behaviour, you lot," Hannah said.

Taking a turn in the cave, they saw a group of four. All of them were vampires, just as Hannah had said, but that wasn't the shocking thing about them. For Quinn, it was what was on their faces.

"Those…masks," Quinn said.

"Oh, it looks like you already know quite a bit about the Red vampires then. We wear these masks whenever for a meeting among the members." Hannah explained and soon pulled out a mask from under her shirt. It was a red mask, with two large teeth on the sides- it was half of a red Oni mask.

Not just that, but it looked identical to the one that Quinn used to wear when he fought in the past.

"This mask is to remind us of who we worship."

Hearing those words, Quinn could feel his heart beating faster.

'It can't be.'

"Many don't know this, but the great Hero Quinn Talen used to wear this."

Now Quinn was really starting to scratch his head.

*****

# Chapter 1602: The End Goal
Upon seeing and hearing this, the first thing that Quinn thought was that he was glad that he didn't bring Peter. The latter would have straight-up laughed and perhaps offended these vampires, and unlike the humans before, it would have quite possibly caused a head-on argument before they ended up finding out about anything.

Still, this was something Quinn wasn't expecting.

'The red vampires worship me... not Laxmus or Bryce, but me? That doesn't make any sense. The humans see me as a hero, and so do the vampires. I fought to save them both; I introduced both of them to the world. So why would the red vampires worship me?'

It was beginning to make Quinn's blood boil thinking about it. Someone perhaps used his name to convince these vampires to do something they never wished to do, and he now wanted to get to the bottom of this situation.

Thankfully, someone was by his side that looked to be just as shocked as he was, which meant this wasn't public knowledge to them all.

"You also worship the Hero Quinn? This is the first time I am hearing something like this," Jessica said out loud and immediately had stares coming from all the others in the room. It was making her feel a little nervous. "I mean, I never knew…do you mind telling us why, so we can learn more and become a closer part of the red vampires?" She smiled.

Seeing this, Quinn felt like he had made the right choice in bringing her.

The group moved closer before they explained, and Quinn carefully looked at all of their faces. He was wondering if he might recognise one of them. It was hard with only the bottom part of their masks, but it seemed like they were all strangers.

'They all feel as strong as Hannah; there aren't really any special ones among them.' Quinn thought. 'I need to meet someone in a higher position or strength if I want to know more about them, but let's do one thing at a time.'

"Do you really think we can trust these guys?" One of the vampires shouted out.

"I'm not comfortable with you bringing random vampires to our meeting spot." The other shouted.

"Please, we are meant to be welcoming to any vampires that wish to join our cause." Hannah replied, folding her arms. "Besides, here is my reason for trusting and bringing them in."

It was then, from her wristwatch, that the image of their bounties had appeared. And reading the amount of money displayed under their name and faces nearly made their eyes pop out. Unlike before, where vampires cared little for the world currency, now that they were involved in the current world, they cared for it quite a bit.

They all knew that these vampires had to have done something pretty serious to get a bounty on their heads like that. It cleared up a lot of the suspicions the others had. The group sat down on some logs placed in a circle. Quinn, along with Jessica, sat on the same wooden log on the ground.

"About your question earlier, since you're going to be a part of our group, I will explain a few things for you. We believe that Quinn Talen had a different goal after saving the humans." Hannah started to explain.

"There are many that believed that he wanted humans to work alongside vampires, but there is another side to it; what if he didn't?"

'I did.' Quinn wanted to say but kept his mouth shut.

"The vampire settlement, there was no need for it to be moved back then as he had done so. At the same time, Quinn had turned every human close to him, from his friends to those in his group, into a vampire. With this mask, we believe he was trying to hide another side to him."

Hearing this, Quinn could somewhat understand how they had come to that conclusion, especially after a thousand years. But one would seriously have to twist a few things to think this way. If the Cursed faction were still publicly involved in the current world, then maybe this wouldn't have happened.

"This is a belief that all of the red vampires can agree on." Hannah continued. "But because of this, there is something that not all of the Red vampires agree on, and that splits us into two groups. One side wants to kill humans or rule over them. Then there are those like us who wish to show humans the benefits of being a vampire and then turn them. Some in our group might be a bit forceful. However, I am not like that."

Although it could have been easy to disregard and not believe what Hannah was saying, there was a smile on her face when she said the last line. Quinn had seen the same smile when Hannah was talking to the other humans.

He wanted to believe what she was saying, and he did believe what she was saying. Although he still felt it was wrong to try and turn others into vampires rather than letting those who wish to be human to let them be humans, at least she wasn't forceful about it.

'So there are even good vampires in the Red vampire group.' Quinn thought. The whole situation was certainly complicated, so he was happy he hadn't decided outright to destroy all the red vampires for causing difficult troubles for the other vampires.

"Okay, that's great you told them about our view of the Hero Quinn." One of the men from earlier interrupted. "But should we really talk about our mission before knowing if our leader has accepted them?"

"Well, I think if someone does find out what we plan to do, then we can track them down quite easily. Besides, today is just an update, and I think they might be able to help us." Hanah explained.

Sitting upright, Quinn was ready to hear carefully. If they did plan to do something to this town, he would stop them. Perhaps not kill them, but at least stop them.

"Our goal, for the time being, is to keep gathering information from the town. Honestly, I think they know nothing, but it's just for a while as we wait for the others to arrive. Once they have arrived, we will head to the Vampire Corps base and join them."

"Join the Vampire corps?" Jessica repeated. "Are you planning on leaving the Red vampires to join the corps?"

The others laughed at this comment, showing how unlikely that was to be the case, but that only meant they would be joining undercover.

"What do they have that you need?" Quinn asked, getting straight to the point.

"We need to know how close they are to finding the Red heart. Now, you might not know about this because it's not general knowledge, but there is another reason we decided to brand ourselves the name Red vampires, not just because red is the colour of our eyes and the blood we feast on.

"No, it's because, despite the two groups' visions not aligning with each other, we work together to find one thing. The thing that our Hero left us. The Red Heart."

When saying Hero, it was obviously referring to Quinn, but Red Heart? Quinn didn't remember leaving a red heart anywhere.

"What is this red heart that you are looking for, and why are you looking for it?" Quinn asked.

"Quinn Talen created the red heart during the fight with the Dalki leader. A condensed form of blood gathered and concentrated to the strongest degree, creating a blood crystal that we call the red heart."

Now Quinn knew exactly what Hannah was talking about, and he did indeed create it, but it looks like the cursed faction didn't have possession of it. Has it gone missing?

"The Red Heart will give us the power to turn everyone into a vampire. We have to get our hands on that before any of the other groups do."

*****

# Chapter 1603: What Are You?
After getting split up from Quinn and his group, the remaining three needed to decide what they would do next, making Lucia and Minny stare at Peter for answers.

"Well, we don't know when they will come back, so I guess our best bet is just to stay in this town." After saying those words, standing in the middle of a busy street, Peter folded his arms.

The two girls waited for a while and noticed that some of the Travellers were still looking towards them—some of them pulling something up on their wristwatch and other devices, perhaps comparing the bounty posters with the faces of the three.

In the end, the girls looked at each other and then looked towards Peter like he was meant to do something, but he had yet to move from the same spot; in fact, he didn't even blink. He just stood there with his arms crossed.

"Is he dead?" Lucia whispered, to which Minny shrugged her shoulders and started to run up to Peter climbing on top of his back until she eventually sat on his shoulders. It was quite a thing for a young girl like her to do, but then Lucia realised that she was, after all, a vampire.

Tapping Peter's forehead, Miiny was waiting for a reaction but still managed to get nothing out of him at all.

"Okay, I can't take it anymore, all these people staring at us... I need to go into a shop and get some clothes to cover myself up." Lucia said as she stormed off towards a clothes shop, not bothering whether Peter was coming along or not.

"Hey, Uncle Peter, I think we should follow her and go along with her. Remember what daddy Quinn said? That we should protect ourselves as best as we can. I think that included her as well." Minny said in her childish voice.

"You might be right; she is the one with the money after all."

Following into the clothes shop after Lucia, the two noticed that the clothes were similar to what the people in the town were wearing. It was a single piece of clothing that covered the legs and upper body part, with a piece that tied around one's waist.

Although they all looked the same, the design and pattern on each of them were different. Even the colours, among other things, had variations, and there were with hoods too, the types which Lucia now had in her hands.

On top of that, when she went to the table, she had already picked out two more that looked to be a fit for both Minny and Peter. After turning around, she paused in surprise to see that Peter had moved from his spot and followed her.

"I thought you were going to stand there even if the world was to end." Lucia joked as she handed him the outfit.

"Is this for us? I didn't ask you for one, and you didn't know we were in the shop and bought one for us anyway?" Peter replied.

"Of course she did!" Minny said, grabbing her clothes as well. "Lucia is a kind aunty."

"I think you mean sister, but I'll let it go." Lucia smiled.

It was the first time that Peter had seen her smile, and for him, naturally seeing her face, he had decided to smile back at her as well.

"Oh, the zombie can smile."

Upon hearing those words, Peter's smile quickly disappeared. Although he knew that she meant nothing by those words as Lucia had no idea what Peter was, it made him realise once again that he was no longer a human.

The three of them quickly changed clothes, and Peter still placed his armour and weapons carefully under the arm compartment. Wearing the armour made him look bulkier, but at the same time, it didn't make it too apparent that he was a traveller.

Coming out from the changing rooms, Peter saw Minny hustle out in a red styled dress with golden dragons rising to the top. She didn't wear her mask, as she had recently learned to control her shadow powers and had hidden it in there for the time being, but Peter had to admit that the red dress along with the mask was quite the stylish set.

Then Lucia came out. Honestly, the clothes weren't too different from what she usually wore. However, the dress was more tight-fitting around her body. At the same time, it was white with a golden dragon pattern running up both sides. It looked like she had somewhat sorted out her hair as well. Brushing it out, she allowed it to flow down the sides.

"How do I look?" Lucia asked.

"You look…good," Peter said, and nothing else, which for some reason embarrassed Lucia a bit as she quickly left the shop and tracking her closely was Minny. Peter stared at the exit for a moment, and then he too walked out. Soon, the three of them were strolling down the street.

They wouldn't leave the town, but now with different clothes, they could still explore a little without the stares. Peter also wondered where exactly had the clothes from before gone. After asking Lucia, Peter learned that she was using a storage ring.

It had a limited capacity, but it worked similar to Quinn's dimensional space. It allowed one to store items inside a ring, necklace or more. This had become quite common after the discovery of a new crystal in the vampire solar system.

Eventually, while they were walking, they suddenly heard a growl.

"Are you hungry?" Peter asked. He had forgotten that Lucia was a human; in other words, she could succumb to these things.

"I mean, it wouldn't hurt to grab a bite." She replied.

The three had entered a large restaurant that was two floors high. There were around fifty or so round tables with customers occupying most of them, and it was bustling with food and drinks shared all around. Still, they managed to get a seat quickly, as Peter had run over to one as soon as it was empty before anyone else, claiming it.

There were a few annoyed looks, but Minny smiled at them, conveying sorry, which let the other customer ignore the group and mind their own business. After looking at the menu, Lucia ordered food for herself, and the waiter, with a small notebook in his hand, scribbled Lucia's order and then glanced towards the other two.

"I'm okay, thanks. I won't be having anything," Peter answered.

"Same for me!" Minny said with a smile.

"I didn't realise that the two of you were going to make me eat on my own. It's quite embarrassing." Lucia added, "You know, they do serve blood at this establishment. Times have changed now; they won't look at you strangely for drinking blood."

Although Peter had seen blood on the menu, he couldn't see something that he could eat. At the same time, even if it was on the menu, it wasn't something he would have wanted to eat in front of Lucia, though he didn't know why he thought about this.

"I don't drink blood, and I'm not a vampire," Peter replied. "If I did eat in front of you, it would just make you sick."

"Not a vampire, so what are you?" The second Lucia had finished asking her question; she noticed a large man walking towards their table, towering above them. He had already swung his hammer, which was already above his head, coming towards them too fast for her to react.

It was then that she saw the hammer hit right into Peter's side, crushing the bones in his shoulder and arms, and the next second he was gone from her sight. He crashed through several tables and right into the restaurant wall on the other side.

As the onlookers looked at Peter, they could see the strike had utterly crushed the right side of his body. There were screams from all around as they were sure that he was dead and not just that, but several people whom he had crashed into had died as well.

It was clear that the man with that hammer was not an ordinary one, and behind him, there were other people as well.

Upon raising her head, Lucia noticed red tribal tattoos that ran down his face, and they continued up to his wrist.

"No…it's the Triple A-Rank traveller group...The Behemoths." Lucia said, shaking in fear.

The traveller groups had ranks assigned to them just like before the war, and although they weren't large factions like there used to be in the past, their ranks gave a proximate evaluation of their strength.

"That's right." The large man with a hammer chuckled. "We couldn't believe that those with such a large bounty would come to a town like this, and now that you have come, how can we simply waste such an opportunity?"

Lucia looked towards Minny, who was still at the table. She wondered what to do; even the original vampire she feared couldn't face such a group if he were here.

"AHHH!" Just then, everyone heard a scream coming from the side of the room. Turning their heads for a split second, they saw the man struck by the hammer was moving from the wall, and at the same time, in front of their eyes, his body was healing.

The crushed bones and the torn flesh were getting back to normal, except for the clothes on his body; this led to the robe only covering three-fourths of his body.

"How is that possible? What is he?" Someone whispered, but in the pin-drop silence, everyone heard it.

Glancing towards the man that just hit him, Peter rushed off from his feet, his fist covered in a strange aura, and before anyone could react, it slammed right into the large man's face, pushing him through several of the tables, chairs and the wall of the building.

They saw a big hole when they looked at where the man had gone - he went through the building and was now lying on the other side of the street.

"Just think of me as a Zombie," Peter spoke, answering Lucia's earlier question as the last few scratches on his arm healed.

*****

# Chapter 1604: What Is Your Goal?
Unlike the mud mask that Peter would make using his soul weapon, the disguise that originated from his ability, wouldn't go away from being hit. However, he did have to use his abilities MC cells to keep it the way he was before, and that was exactly what he was doing.

Some members of the Behemoth gang ran outside to check on their friend, and a few seconds later they loudly lamented his fate.

"He's dead!"

The whole restaurant turned to look at Peter. Some inside had seen his poster, while others had no clue who he was, but they were sure of one thing. This person was strong. To be able to kill someone from a Triple A-Rank Traveller group with one punch was unheard of. What's more, they had been unable to see him move from his position from the wall. Lastly, the strange healing powers that allowed him to heal from even cracked bones.

'Damn it, if I had been paying attention to my surroundings, I wouldn't have even let that hammer hit me, and now I've been hurt as well.' Peter thought. 'I really should keep practising Qi like Quinn suggested, that also would have helped me from protecting myself and my body from being crushed, and now she's looking at me like that.'

Turning his head towards Lucia, he thought that she would have freaked out given his abnormal healing speed. Many people did when they saw it, however, she was just left with her mouth wide open.

'While I don't know all of their members, the Behemoths wouldn't just let anyone join their group… yet he was able to kill one of them with a single hit!' Lucia thought. 'No, I shouldn't be surprised. I have to get used to the fact that I'm not travelling with someone normal. If 'Nate' is an Original, does that mean he was also someone from that era? But I don't recognise him…'

"How dare you kill Rodeiro?!!" Another large, burly man pointed his weapon at Peter. It seemed like the Behemoth group were filled with large, bulky people who mostly used large weapons. There were giant axes, hammers, greatswords and more.

"You three have officially become our Behemoths enemies! We planned to hunt most of you down alive, but you can now forget about it! Anyone who wishes to help us shall obtain a share of the reward. Everyone else, get out!" The man announced.

Hearing this, several people that were inside the restaurant quickly left the restaurant, scared to get involved in the fighting. However, there were other Traveller groups that were interested in the bounty on their heads, and with a strong faction backing them, even after seeing what Peter had done, they weren't afraid.

There had been ten Behemoth members in the establishment, but with the other groups, their force numbered around thirty. Once the area was cleared, the large man by the name of Edu pulled out a giant axe and swung it towards Lucia who was closest to him.

The two of them were quite a far distance away, so she didn't even think it would hit her. Still, she pulled out her spear just in case to try to defend herself and was ready to fight for her life. That's when the axe started to grow in size, becoming gigantic, almost covering half of the restaurant. It looked like the man's ability allowed him to make weapons larger, and she could tell it wasn't just large, but judging by the surrounding wind, the weight of the weapon seemed to have increased as well.

'All I can do is block this hit, with my Qi!' She thought, getting her spear ready and moving it to the side. However, before the gigantic axe could hit her, it had stopped, and the other saw that one man was responsible for it, holding the sharp edge of the axe with his fingers.

"Don't worry, I was told to protect you and Minny, so as long as you stay with me, I'll make sure that nobody will be able to harm a single hair on your head." Peter stated.

Looking at his fingertips, Lucia could see they were covered in a strange yellow glow.

'Is that Qi… but then why can I see it? I've never seen Qi in such a solid form! Just how much strength does he have to stop that large weapon?'

It wasn't just that, as the next second, gripping tightly the Wight had broken the head on the axe, which he quickly grabbed with both hands as the others came towards him and pulled it out from Edu's hands. The axe was shrinking by the second, but before the axe it had reverted to its normal size, Peter swung it as hard and fast as he could.

The handle part of it hit the Behemoth members as well as the others in the restaurant. No matter what ability or active armour they had used to try to block the attack, they were swept off her feet and crashed through the restaurant's walls out to the other side of the feet.

"Hehe, Uncle Peter is so strong!" Minny called out in excitement as she watched this.

"Strong is an understatement. He has abnormal healing, strange Qi, and inhuman strength. Any one of those would make him a powerhouse, yet he has all three. That guy could be one of the strongest people in the world, and he's right here by my side." Lucia mumbled to herself. 'Just how could it be that the world doesn't remember someone like him?'

Those that had been on the second floor, ready to attack, suddenly, reconsidered their approach. Still, as Peter walked out the front of the building, Lucia quickly followed him along with Minnie, and they had only taken a few steps when she had stopped.

'What is all this? Does everyone on Mars know where we are!' She panicked.

Lucia was unsure about their exact number, but she was certain they had to number in the hundreds, Travellers everywhere. It wasn't just members of the Behemoth group, there were also other prominent Traveller group standing on the rooftops, out from the other buildings and lining up down the street.

Before the others could even act or say anything, Peter ran straight towards the first man and kneed him in the face, crushing his skull and killing him instantly. The Wight then let go, causing him to fall on the floor.

"If you plan to stand in my way of protecting those two, I don't care how many of you I will have to kill." Peter stated, as he knelt down by the crushed man's face and pressed his hand on him.

"Wake up!" The Wight shouted, and the next moment the clearly dead man started to stand up again, completely ignoring the fact that his skull had just been crushed.

"Kill them!" A man shouted, and it looked like everyone was ready to attack Peter and the others, not caring whether this town might get destroyed in the process.

——

Inside the cave where Quinn and the others were, it looked like one of the vampires had been informed about what was happening in the town. Quinn could hear it clearly, and so could everyone else. Multiple factions had entered the town in search of a bounty, and they didn't care about the people of the place.

"Do you know these people?" The vampire asked.

"Yes," Quinn replied. "I'm not too worried about them, but the trouble or fighting it might cause. There might be a bloodbath."

The others thought Quinn was exaggerating, or perhaps didn't know what factions exactly had arrived in the place.

"These are high-level factions, Hannah. If we get involved in saving these vampires, there is a good chance that our group could get wiped out. We need to stick to the mission." The man next to her cautioned the red vampire.

"And what mission is that exactly?" Jessica interrupted. "To search for the red heart? I thought you said that your goal was to turn humans into vampires. Well, then, why don't you save them from these attackers. Why don't you actually help people? If you showed them your strength and what you're capable of, I'm pretty sure that would be a good way to convince people into turning them into vampires, don't you think?"

After saying the words, Jessica was a bit silent, wondering if she had taken it a step too far, but she soon saw a smile on Hannah's face.

"The new girl is right. More and more factions will probably come. We need to save who we can from the fighting and move the fighting to somewhere else. We will try our best to help out your friends before it is too late." Hannah stated.

Then, out from the inside of her pocket, she passed Jessica something and went over to Quinn, giving him the same item.

"Please put it on. We are going to make sure to let them know that the red vampires were the ones that saved them. This mask will soon become a symbol to all those out there."

Looking at it, Quinn felt like he was going back to his old days as he grabbed it and placed it on his face.

# Chapter 1605: Protect Is An Order
After witnessing the sight in front of her, it would be an understatement to say that Lucia was amazed by everything around her because she watched a single man take on several high ranking Travellers at once.

At that moment, Peter raised four people he had killed in the fight so far. He then ordered two of them to stay close to Lucia and Minny to protect them and not let them get involved in the fight. At the same time, the remaining two would be supporting Peter during the fight.

A strong blast of ice energy came toward him from his right side, but before it could even hit him, one of his Lesser wights sacrificed itself, taking the hit. Seeing this, Peter didn't hesitate to smash the ice that contained his Wight and forcefully threw the body part towards the ice user, aiming towards him, high up on one of the roofs of the buildings.

In the next second, he ran towards another man and kicked him, sending him flying into the building on the opposite side and destroying the wall in the process. It was clear that there was currently no one here who was stronger or faster than Peter.

However, with the sheer amount of travellers that were there and them working to gather being in the same factions together, they had their ways.

"Now!" one of them shouted, and immediately, from underneath, the ground had exploded. The explosion chucked up dirt in front of Peter and blocked his view. It was then that those that were using long-ranged weapons fired towards the cloud of dust, and those with ranged abilities also added their attacks in the ensuing assault.

It was impossible for anyone to avoid, even if they had his speed. Regardless when the smoke settled, all they could see was Peter holding up another traveller by their head, only using his finger strength.

At the same time, Peter's body was slowly healing from the edges he was hit on. Dropping the body on the ground, Peter proceeded to pull out what looked like a beast bolt that had gone through his arm.

"Always protect the head," Peter mumbled to himself. "It's good that I actually listened to that rule. A beast bolt actually managed to pierce quite deep through my arm."

'I wondered why someone had put such high bounties on our heads.' Lucia frowned. 'At first, I thought it was all a mistake or a misunderstanding, but now it looks like that's not the case.'

'The bounty was for him and that vampire. These two...someone must have known their real strength. I knew something was up when that other one got Zinon's armour. The attack in the hotel...was aimed at them, but why...why would someone put a bounty on their heads?'

At that moment, a powerful blast hit the familiar infront of her, causing the lesser weight to fall to the ground. Several pillars of earth spikes began to rise from the ground, and Lucia quickly jumped and avoided them all.

She could feel the rumbling under her feet and was quick to act. During her jump, though, she had grabbed onto Minny as well.

"I'm sorry," Minny shouted out, feeling pretty useless, almost on the verge of tears.

"It's not your fault. It's these people who are blinded by the greed of money. I mean, look what's happening." Lucia replied.

It was then they noticed that even the people who weren't taking part in the fight were now injured. The Owners of the restaurants and other buildings were close to pulling out their hair in despair upon witnessing the state of their shops. At the same time, the remaining bystanders were shaking in fear.

However, she had no time to worry about that. There were still things she needed to do. Getting her spear ready, she thrust it forward towards the Traveller that stood closest to her. A lightning strike left her spear, but an earth wall rose, blocking the attack.

Despite this, the lighting, midway, seemed to get a second surge of strength as it sped up and blasted right through the earth wall. The strike continued and hit the man in the chest, causing him to fall to the ground and convulse uncontrollably.

'Earth users have always been tough for lighting users to go against. So I had to use some of my Qi in that attack. But I can't keep using Qi. Otherwise, I'll be exhausted.'

In the middle of her thoughts, before she could react, she was pulled up off the ground, and in the next moment, holding her under his arm, was Peter. Minny, who was now unconscious, was in Lucia's grasp.

"My job is to protect the both of you. I almost forgot that, and I'm sorry." Peter explained. "I could probably beat all of these guys myself, but you are the priority."

Jumping up from a ledge, Peter made it onto one of the roofs. The best way for the others to not get hurt was to run away from the situation or get to an area where Peter could fight them more easily.

However, there were several Travellers on the roof, as if waiting for them. One had a super-speed ability, and he ran right towards Peter with two daggers and jumped towards the trio.

Peter also jumped at the right moment, and still holding the other two, he kicked the incoming Traveller's arm, breaking it in an instant as the dagger fell off of the latter's hands.

As soon as Peter's foot hit the ground, he lifted it again and kicked the Traveller in the stomach, causing blood to gush out of his mouth.

"You should put us down; it will make it easier for you to fight!" Lucia asked. "Also, you're going to get tired quicker if you continue like this."

"I don't get tired," Peter replied as he continued to run forward, jumping side from side, avoiding a range of different abilities. As they landed on the rooftops; the tiles below their feet would crack and burst in all directions.

Sensing some type of invisible wall, an ability from one of the Travellers, he didn't stop and ran forward at full speed. Peter smashed the barrier, but he was slowed down in the process, and now they had surrounded him.

"I know you're strong, but the number of Travellers coming here is countless. There is nothing we can do! You take the child and get out of here!" Lucia shouted.

"No!" Peter shouted as he held onto Lucia tighter, now grabbing her with both arms. He was holding her as if she was his bride in his arms. Then, lifting his leg, he stomped on the ground.

It destroyed the rooftop, causing them to fall down, but not just with the part of the roof below his feet; rather, the whole rooftop was going down. Peter collapsed the building's structure from a single stomp.

The travellers stepped back, waiting for the outcome, but they had seen this Zombie of a person come out from a much worse state than this, and they were sure it would be the same again, and they knew they were right when they saw the pile of rubble suddenly move.

Covered in blood, Peter stood up with injuries on his head but had safely protected the two girls.

"Why?!" Lucia shouted. "Why are you doing so much to protect me?!"

Something like this, she had never had someone in her life do something like this for her…she wondered whether Peter was doing this because he...

"Because my friend told me to, and I will do anything he tells me to do even if it costs my life," Peter replied.

With the Travellers still unwilling to give up, it looked like they still had a lot of fights to go through.

"Those were some good words, and I would do the same for you, my friend." A familiar voice resounded through the scene.

The Travellers who stood on the rooftops of nearby buildings weren't quick to act because now they could see that these three weren't alone anymore. Shielding Peter's group from the Travellers were seven people, all wearing strange red masks over their faces.

"We are the Red Vampires!" Hannah declared, walking out in front. "Look what you've done to this peaceful town! Because of you outsiders, this place is now destroyed, and we won't let you continue acting like this."

From the look in the Travellers eyes, Quinn, who was also in the group of seven, was sure that the Travellers wouldn't back down so easily.

Recognising the voice from earlier, Minny, who had now regained her composure, immediately hopped off from Lucia and ran towards Quinn.

"They...they tried to kill us!" Minny started crying as she tugged on his leg.

The other vampires seeing this wondered what sort of vampire travelled with their daughter like this—doing these things. It also gave the image that this vampire was quite soft.

Rubbing the top of her head, Quinn bent down to her height.

"I see..well, don't worry. I will make sure they never try that again."

Upon hearing what Quinn had said, the vampires thought he was just trying to reassure his daughter. It was then, after standing up, Quinn looked at all the Travellers and sighed.

One of them moved slightly, less than an inch forward, in the next second. Lifting his hand, Quinn shaped it like a gun, and out from his finger, a blood bullet shot out, hitting him right in the knee, making him fall off the roof and onto the floor.

It was strange because it had happened so fast that everyone froze, wondering what had just happened.

****

# Chapter 1606: Controlling One's Strength
Out of all the travellers, only a few of them were able to comprehend what had happened, or at least saw what had happened because to most, all they could see was a red masked vampire with his hand out—pointing at the location where one of them had fallen from a rooftop.

Quinn stood somewhat behind Hannah, who was leading the vampire group and standing at the front. She hadn't expected him to make the first move, and she didn't see the blood bullet leave from Quinn's hand. All she could see was the damage that had occurred on the Travelers leg. Allowing her to guess what the attack was. Looking over at his hand's position had only confirmed her thoughts.

'That has to be the blood bullet. Can he perform something like that?' but he smells like a regular vampire; how is that possible? And I've barely seen a bullet that fast before.' Hannah thought.

It was the same for the other vampires. The one move he had made showed that this person was no ordinary vampire. They somewhat understood now why there was a large bounty on one's head.

Trying to make the best out of the current situation, Hannah decided to speak once again.

"As you can see, we don't want to hurt you. That is a warning that if you continue to cause trouble for this town and pursue these people, we will get involved!" She shouted once again.

It seemed like Quinn's little act had somewhat caused them to be hesitant in their movements, and the people that filled the streets were a little confused. They had heard the name red vampires, but why did the woman seem so concerned for the people. It was the first for many of them to hear something like this.

"It's not so strange." One of the residents said. "I heard that in one of the big Dhampir attacks, the red vampires came and supported the vampire corps in one of the fights."

"Ah yeah, I heard that as well. It was one of their leaders, that strong female vampire. They thought that the red vampires would request something. Some land from the corps unit or something else, but they said nothing and just left."

Hearing some of the stories behind him made Quinn feel like there were a set of good vampires among the red vampires. He needed to know more about this group.

"That damned zombie already killed some of our people, and then he raised them from the dead!" A traveller shouted. "You said you weren't trying to hurt us. We have lost too much al-"

Suddenly, the man speaking knee exploded, causing him to fall over on one side and hit the floor. When Hannah turned around, she could see that the newly recruited vampire had his hand pointed towards the man's position.

"Let's make this really clear. You attacked our vampires. You did so full well trying to kill them. If you are prepared to kill, you should be prepared to die as well." Quinn spoke. "Right now, we are the ones that are giving you a chance."

'He used the blood bullet again, but that is a risky move.' Hannah thought. 'Right now, they are intimidated by his strong attack, but if he uses both hands, he will only be able to use that move a total of 8 more times. Simply put, it's just a bluff.'

Although this would have been the case for other vampires, this was not the case for Quinn at all. No longer did Quinn get the drawback from using the blood bullet as he had done in the past? If he wanted to, he could continually fire it at all of the Travellers that we're here right now,

He had chosen to use this move because he realised after using his blood control that other vampires would certainly get suspicious, but a move like this was something that other vampires were capable of doing.

On top of that, he was annoyed that these people had attacked those close to him, so he needed to vent some of his anger out.

"You Fu*k-"

Bang, another shot had gone off as soon as one of the travellers opened her mouth.

They could see that this was the work of only a single vampire, and seeing that it was like this, they believed that perhaps all of the vampires were capable of this. Some of them were starting to have second thoughts. At the end of the day, what was the point of money if they wouldn't live to see another day?

"Good, it looks like we have come to an understanding-"

As Hannah was ready to finish her sentence, a large force of attack had come from behind. Two of the red blood vampires towards the back had managed to create blood walls just in time, to stop the attack somewhat.

Jets of what looked like water were powerful and had crashed through the Blood walls. The walls had slowed down the attack somewhat, allowing them to move slightly out of the way, but both of them were still hit on the arm.

"It's the flowing water faction, another triple-A rank faction!" One of the Travellers shouted. Seeing this, the confidence in all of them grew. As time went on, after all, more and more factions, famous bounty hunters and more would all be coming after the large bounty on their heads.

"Damn it, there's more, and these guys aren't weak!" The vampire said, holding onto his arm. It wasn't healing, and noticing this, Quinn could tell it was because Qi had been infused with their attacks. Due to the spread of Qi, vampires were no longer so much stronger than humans.

"Why are we risking our lives when these guys aren't even members yet!" The vampire shouted.

Two more water jet streams had come out. It was fast, and it looked like the vampires would be unable to avoid them. When they felt someone push their heads towards the ground, the jet streams of water had gone completely over their head.

Looking at who had saved their lives, they could tell that it was the new vampire Quinn.

"If you are fighting for the lives of those that I care about, then I will protect you as well."

Running forward, Quinn went towards the Flowing Water faction that seemed to consist of five members. Meanwhile, Hannah, Jessica and the others were dealing with the members that had come towards the front. Peter continued to stay by the two girls' side as he wished to help them out even more.

The jet streams of water were fast and consistent for Quinn, which were pricing annoying. He would run forward as fast as he could while using the flash step at the right time to avoid them, but at times, he would have to take a step back to avoid them.

'This is really annoying; if I had my shadow, they would be easier to deal with.'

Of course, there were other ways Quinn could deal with them, but he was trying not to show too much to the vampires. Eventually reaching them, Quinn had proceeded to attack with a thigh kick to the one closest.

Immediately, when making contact, the man's bones had been crushed, putting up no resistance and causing his leg to bend inward, so much so that his leg had actually been torn off from his body, flying off in the distance and hitting another person, knocking them over.

'Crap, I was trying to hold back. I sensed he was using the second stage of Qi, so I thought he would be able to handle that one.'

When another member tried to attack Quinn again, crashing water on top of him, he spun around, avoiding the hit, getting behind the other member. Grabbing his arms, Quinn pulled on them towards him, then kicked his back, once again, causing both of his arms to be removed from his body, blood gushing everywhere. A pop was heard when they had been released from their shoulder joints.

Some of the travellers, people and other vampires that were seeing this thought one thing, that the new vampire recruit was brutal.

'Sh!t, this is meant to be a triple AAA rank faction member. Why are their bodies so…weak.' Quinn thought as he had once again misjudged his own strength and their strength as well.

*BEEP *BEEP

The sound of the travellers' watches they were wearing continued to go off. Everyone could hear it, so they were wondering what was going on. Those that hadn't been fighting quickly checked to see the message, and their faces had the look of dread on them.

"Wait, stop!" A traveller shouted, and not just one but several others as well.

"Everyone stop; it's the bounty! The bounty has been dropped!"

*****

# Chapter 1607: Years
"I don't understand a thing you're doing." Agent Four said while rubbing his forehead with the tip of his fingers.

Since Logan seemed interested in these vampires, they also became Agent Four's interest. They were watching the events in the little town unfold. It was impossible not to find an electronic device one could monitor from in this day and age.

The wristwatches and the cameras in restaurant buildings, among other things, were there, just to name a few. The two of them were witnessing everything going on, and in the end, Logan had decided to call off the bounty.

"Well, do you mind explaining? You usually love to blabber a lot, so I wonder what has gotten your tongue so tied up?" Agent four asked.

Although Agent Four was teasing his fellow companion, the truth was, something had shocked Logan into his actions, and he didn't know how to reply or what to say at this moment as his head was beginning to process a few things.

'It didn't quite click at first because they look nothing alike, but that strength, that speed, the healing powers and that power. If they are travelling with vampires, all signs point that it was a Wight.' Logan thought. 'However, that Wight managed to raise four dead at the same time, that's something unheard of even between Wights. I only know one capable of such a feat is…wait…could it be him?

'Peter…Peter also had the transformation ability, he could easily disguise himself, but I don't recognise any of the ones he is travelling with. Is it really Peter? Has he finally returned after all this time?

'But why now? After going missing with the tomb for so many years, why now? None of this makes any sense; I have to find out though; I have to find out for myself.'

It was then that Logan looked out of the corner of his eye towards Agent Four, who was staring directly back at him.

"Something is seriously up, isn't there? What did you find out?" Agent Four asked as he started walking over towards Logan.

"It's nothing," Logan replied as he brought up images of the two on-screen. The destruction caused and injured people running for their lives due to the fighting could easily be seen in the pictures. "The whole town has been destroyed because of the Travellers. Honestly, I never expected them to act like wild beasts because of the bounty and thought they would have some sense. The chaos is beyond what I expected, so I decided to call off the bounty while I think of another way."

There was a pause, as it looked like Agent Four was taking in what the other had said.

"Besides, it was clear with their strength and the interference of the Red vampires that it has become a matter that is far too big for those travellers to handle."

"I thought, you of all people would have considered all this beforehand, no?" Agent Four asked.

This was what Logan was worried about; it was pretty unbelievable for him to think that the bounty wouldn't have this effect, which was why he had added in the last part as well, for two reasons.

"I thought since you were more robot than human, you wouldn't have emotions towards the others." Said Agent four. "Who cares if the whole town is destroyed? You do understand that if they get their hands on the Red Heart before us, then it won't just be a little town that's going to be destroyed; rather, everyone will die.

"Sacrifice the lives of a few to save the many!" Agent four shouted, slamming his fist onto a console. The console was instantly destroyed into pieces due to the punch, but his fist didn't have a single scratch on the knuckles.

"Don't destroy my things," Logan said immediately, "If you're going to continue to act like this, then leave."

In an instant, in the lab itself, several pods that were placed around the area opened up, and a few seconds later, A.I battle robots had all left quickly flying over to Logan's side. There were around twelve of them in total, and they had their hands held out, already charging energy to fire towards the agent.

"Oh? This is the first time I am seeing you act like this! But do you think those robots that couldn't even help capture those vampires you are after will be able to stop me?" Agent Four shouted with what could only be described as rage as a large vein sticking out from the side of his head.

"Do you really think that I wouldn't keep the best and highest grade crystal robots for myself? And let me reassure you, they aren't made from the same material as the others either." Logan explained. "I will remind you again. I don't want to fight; I only want you to respect my equipment."

The two of them stared at each other for a while, and Agent Four looked back and forth between Logan and the A.I. robots as if he was considering whether to fight them. He always wanted to know just how strong Logan Green was.

However, he decided to scoff as he turned away and avoided any fighting for the moment.

"I will be back to get an update on matters." Agent four said, finally leaving the lab.

As he stomped his feet down the hallway, he had a thought in his mind.

'Something really has him rattled to act like that. There seems to be something that he has noticed that I haven't. Was it those vampires? Do they have a clue to the red heart, and he is trying to keep it to himself? Well, even if that isn't the case, as long as Logan is interested in them, then it is enough for me to be interested in them as well.'

Back in the lab, Logan went back to the video. He was trying to see if he could spot anything important. He played back all the scenes with his suspected Peter in them. He watched the videos repeatedly, and the more he thought about it, Logan felt like the person in the footage was the same person he thought it was, Peter.

'Wights can live forever…but Peter, if you were always alive, why did you come out? Did something happen to Quinn? Or did you find out where he is?'

It was then that Logan went back to the security footage at the hotel, looking at the others who were with the suspected 'Peter'.

'Whom does he trust enough to even travel with? It can't be him…that's impossible. After ten years had passed….' At that moment, Logan's eyes suddenly moistened a bit as he thought about what had occurred ten years after that.

But suddenly, he heard the door to the lab opening again and quickly wiped his face with his sleeves, which hurt a bit since his arms were more solid than usual.

"Oh, your eyes are a bit red; I don't think I've seen that from you since…well, I don't think I've ever seen you in such a state." The one who had entered the lab was a handsome young man.

He had short blonde hair, cut to the side and was quite tall at the same time; It was clear he was gifted with quite an excellent set of genes.

"Hey, what was up with Agent Four's eyes?" The young man giggled at himself after coming up with that joke. "For a second, I thought steam was coming out from his ears."

Walking over, Logan went to the destroyed console and placed all of the A.I. robots back away into their pods.

"Ah, I see, he destroyed one of your machines." The young man sighed.

"Actually, can you do me a favour?" Logan asked, and the smile on the young man's face receded.

"I would like you and your mother to head to mars to check something out for me. This is, of course, not official business, just a personal trip." Logan stated.

The young man didn't hesitate as he smiled back.

"Sure thing, just let me know if you need anything from me, dad."

*****

# Chapter 1608: Dedicated Follower
Immediately after hearing what some of the other Travellers were saying about the bounty, they decided to take a step back. The red vampires were holding onto the wounds that had already been made on their bodies.

It was clear that these Travellers were indeed no ordinary set of Travellers because the vampires themselves weren't weak by any means, just not strong enough to face such a group like this.

"Hey, it's true the bounties have been called off. How is that even possible!" One of the travellers shouted. There was a specific process for bounties to be put up in the first place. One couldn't just request bounties.

One of the reasons for this was that the bounty would have to be inputted and checked. Once confirmed, it could be put through. Simply put, bounties were mainly for criminals on the run. However, the Travellers weren't stupid, and at times, there were ways to bypass this, allowing personal grudge bounties to be put up.

However, for a bounty to be taken down, either the people involved had to have been captured, which clearly wasn't the case here. Otherwise, half of the payment had to be given up to the Travellers association. The money would go towards improving the Travellers centre, medical centres and more, but it wouldn't go to any of the bounty hunters involved.

"What is this bullcrap! People in our faction have died!" Some of the Travellers were furious and gripped their weapons even harder.

While others started to turn away and head out from the scene, which included those from the Flowing water faction that had just arrived, they picked up their wounded and started to leave.

"What are you doing? After they did that to your people, you're just going to leave like that!" A Traveller shouted.

One of the members held the one that Quinn had ripped the arms off. Quinn had seen him do something interesting as he moved the broken arms close to the body and activated Qi. The cells were seen coming together. They weren't completely healed, but it had stopped the bleeding somewhat, joining part of the skin here and there.

"You want us to risk our lives when there isn't even a bounty on the line? That is ridiculous." The man said, turning around with the rest of the group. "And to be honest, even if there was still a bounty. We would be doing the same as we are doing right now."

That last line from one of the top factions really resonated with a lot of the Travellers, and those that felt like they were ready for revenge had decided it was better for them if they were to give up now or risk losing more than they had already done.

Most Travellers didn't belong to the town in the first place. They went around to different cities on different planets frequently with their occupation. It was partly where the name came from, so they didn't care what state they had left the town in.

Only a few Travellers that were locals, who only hunted for income now and then, had gone to apologise to the rest.

"We should head out of this place. Although they might be welcome to us now, they won't feel that way for a long time, and besides, we weren't planning to stick around anyway." Hannah stated.

The others agreed, and soon all of them were on the move, with Peter following along with Quinn and the others. As soon as they got out of the busy buildings and streets of the town, they had entered the forest that would lead to the cave before.

"Wait!" One of the Red vampires said, turning around. Hearing this, the whole group stopped thinking that something might have happened. "I don't mind the others following us back to our camp, but she's a human!"

The vampire pointed towards Lucia, who had come along with the others.

"The others wish to join the Red vampires, okay, but a human has to be turned if we are to trust them."

The vampire started to take a step towards Lucia, and looking nervous, she went to grab her spear, but before she could even grab it, another person already had his hands around the vampire's neck.

"You touch her, and you're dead," Peter said, gripping tightly, making sure he knew who had the superior strength.

Seeing one of their allies being hurt, and by what was a stranger to them no less, they had decided to try to attack him. Each one started to raise the blood aura in their body as they went to attack peter.

"STOP!" Quinn shouted.

All four of their bodies had frozen in place. They didn't know why until they could see that the new vampire was looking towards them all with red glowing eyes.

"If you dare touch him, I will make you all kill yourselves!" Quinn said, making sure they knew why he was angry.

'Can the others not move?' Hannah thought. 'With the glowing red eyes, is that vampire really using the influence skill on them and its working. This is not something a simple vampire can do. I thought something was strange about this person, but could they be a vampire lord? Then why do they smell like regular vampires?

'Whatever the case, he will be a big help in our goal.'

"Everyone, calm down. At the moment, she is just coming along as a supporter." Hannah explained. "We are just heading to the vampire corps area, not the Red vampires base, so there is no need to worry. If our new friend wishes to bring her, we can explain the rules to him then when those roads cross, we will sort it out then, but for now, it would be best if we cooperate, we just got out of a tricky situation after all."

Hearing this, Quinn nodded, and Peter soon let go of the vampire in his grasp. He walked back towards the girls staying by their side in case the others tried to do anything else.

With the little spat over, the group continued to head towards their meeting spot from before, but the vampires who had tried to attack Peter were left with a thought in their mind.

'Am I just imagining things, but did his influence skill also suppress our blood aura somehow? No, I must be imagining it. It had just to be the fact that we were frightened but just who is that vampire.'

Eventually reaching the cave, all of the vampires were resting; however, they had split even inside the cave into two groups—Jessica along with hers that she had come along with, and Hannah and her group as well.

To clear the tensions, Quinn had gone over to the other side. He then used his Qi to remove the traces in their body, which allowed them to heal.

"You know how to use Qi?" Hannah recognised immediately.

"I…I'm a human turned vampire and knew how to use Qi before, so it's still with me." Quinn answered.

That seemed like a good enough explanation for her, but for the others in his group who had overheard, now had heard conflicting stories.

'Did Nate just lie?' Jessica thought. 'He said he was a human turned vampire, but he said he was an original as well. Maybe he's just lying to throw them off, but then how does he know Qi?'

"So, what is the plan now?" One of the red vampires asked.

"I have already updated the other group of what has happened. They are on their way and should be here in a few hours. Once we meet up with Tikker, we will head together with him to the vampire corps to join them, and of course, our newest recruits will be joining us. If all goes well on this mission, we will bring them back with us to the red vampires." Hannah smiled.

"Tikker!" One of the vampires sounded surprised. "He…does that mean he will be leading us? If that's the case, he might have a bigger problem with humans than others in our group."

"Why's that?" Quinn asked immediately.

"Because Tikker is a vampire from the other Red Vampire group. The ones that have a slightly different view from us. He is also what is known as a dedicated follower, so he is a higher rank than me and will be leading our group." Hannah answered.

Hearing the word dedicated follower made Quinn think about the system. Was it a coincidence?

# Chapter 1609: Ranking Up
The system had to get its naming sense from somewhere, and it always seemed to be able to know about current situations, adapting to the world around it. Vincent had often talked about how the system had gone beyond what he, Richard and the Green family had intended it to be.

There were a few theories about why this was happening, but no one could be sure. Either way, he had never heard the term 'Dedicated follower' be used by someone until now, which made him more inclined to believe that it wasn't a coincidence at all.

Many vampires were still conversing among themselves, mainly about this Tikker person. It seemed that many of them had an aversion for this person, and Quinn was listening carefully. So far, he had heard that similar to the group he was with, another group of five Red Vampires was coming here.

The two groups were to work together on this special mission to bring them closer together. To the outside and public, the Red vampires appeared as one group, and it seemed whoever this leader or the leaders were, they wanted it to appear this way.

However, the Red Vampires were well aware of what was going on in their group. The divide from within that could tear them apart, which was why they had proceeded to do this.

Seeing that there was a break between their conversation, Quinn stood up and sat down beside Hannah. She seemed the most approachable out of the lot, and finding out she was the leader of this small group, he knew the others would listen to her, and she had the most information in the first place.

"I wanted to ask you a question," Quinn said, being upfront.

"Well, I thought as much. It looked like you wanted to ask something for a while now, so go ahead, feel free. We're stuck together." She smiled.

"It's about what you said earlier about this Tikker person being a dedicated follower. Is he different from you other than being in a higher position and part of the other half? If he is, then what makes the difference?" Quinn asked.

Quinn was a little worried that these might have been strange questions to ask, but before approaching Hannah and the rest, he and Jessica had gone away from the cave, far enough so they couldn't eavesdrop and had asked her all the questions he could about the Red vampires. Claiming he was just checking if anyone had followed them.

It seemed like the rankings or the words they were using weren't general knowledge. So it should have been a safe question for him to ask.

"There are no rankings per se, other than the leaders, Dedicated followers and followers; there aren't any rankings between us," Hannah replied. "However, it's more how closely connected you are to those above. There are some group leaders like us that aren't even led by a follower. Which is why I say that there really isn't something like a ranking difference amongst us."

Hannah then went to lift her dress once more, showing off the mark from before. Having a closer look, it was definitely what Laxmus looked to have had on him and the same marking that appeared on Layla's sword. Ray, his ancestor, had also told him that the marking was around during his time.

"This is just a tattoo of the markings of the Red Vampires; it's not an actual marking. All followers like myself have one. We aren't required to have one, but we have to look for those that are more like-minded and the most committed to our goals.

"Once a person has proven themselves enough, then that person will get a real mark. It's not just a tattoo, but I have seen it - a marking that glows with power, and that is what a dedicated follower is."

When speaking, Hannah had a smile on her face. Although she was a nice woman, Quinn thought that she had somehow already been zapped into some cult.

"And what does the marking do? Is there any reason you strive for it?" Quinn asked.

"I have seen those with markings grow in power as a vampire. Even those that were weak before are now far stronger. It is said that it brings us closer to our hero, Quinn Talen, and the marking allows us to draw energy from him."

Hearing his name when he was directly in front of the person was still strange, but Quinn was sure after hearing Hannah speak. These markings were the work of another celestial. Another thing that made him wonder what was this marking and the one on Layla's sword, were they the same.

'Maybe it has something to do with the levels? The system told me that the higher the celestial level is, the more powers I would unlock. I wonder, what if that's one of the level's powers? To allow it to mark weapons and objects, giving them great power.

'Although overall, the sword wasn't as strong as a demon tier weapon, its special trait of blocking all abilities, and Qi certainly were. I wonder, if I had those powers, what type of effects on a weapon I can put?'

It certainly was interesting for Quinn to increase his ranking. Looking around the room, he naturally turned to Peter. Originally, Quinn wanted to test his own marking on Peter. Before he did anything though, he wanted to explain to Peter what he was trying to do.

But he didn't get any opportunity due to the sudden attack in the hotel. Still, there were other ways to gather Celestial energy.

Standing up and heading over to Minny, Quinn made sure to block her body away from the others and knelt to her eye level.

"Minny, you were scared back then, but Uncle Peter did good protecting you, right?" Quinn asked.

Minny nodded her head and had a big smile on her face. Even if she was upset, she never was for long.

"Good, I want you to stay close to Peter, he will always protect you, and if he's in trouble, do you remember what I told you?" Quinn asked.

"Of course!" Minny smiled again.

"Good, now you remember that mask that I let you have? Is it okay if I borrow it for a little while? I promise I'll give it back."

She didn't hesitate, as shadows formed around her palm and quickly, the mask appeared. Standing up, Quinn patted her head before heading towards the cave entrance. Seeing this, Jessica wanted to follow but soon saw Quinn returning.

"Oh, I thought you were leaving?" Jessica said.

Quinn didn't respond and just walked to the side of the wall and stood there.

...

The real Quinn was running out in the forest, and he could feel it; he could feel the vampires' energy in the distance. He knew that the other Red Vampire group was coming.

'That shadow clone skill has improved and is certainly useful; too bad he can't speak though, but no one should know it's not me, right? It was even able to copy my disguised form of Chucky.' Quinn thought.

At the moment, he was wearing a mask over his face, and it looked slightly different from what the Red Vampires wore, which was why it was perfect. After all, he didn't know what was going to happen today, and that, of course, all depended on the person he was going to meet.

A few moments later, Quinn decreased his pace and soon came to a halt. There were fewer trees in the area, so he thought it would be an excellent place to fight if needed.

"It looks like they have arrived."

Appearing in front of him as if out of thin air were five vampires and in the middle was a bald vampire, with a large red 'T' in the middle of his head.

Quinn's lips curled up as he thought, 'I didn't need the T on your head to know you were Tikker because I can feel it. I can feel the celestial energy coming from you.'
