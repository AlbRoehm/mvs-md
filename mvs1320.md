# Chapter 1320 - Stronger Than A Demon Tier
The junkyard seemed to be endless.

No matter which direction Logan looked in, it was all just plastered in junk, making him even wonder if that might just be the type of planet he was on. Finding a teleporter seemed as likely as finding a needle in a haystack, not that he had the time to leisurely search through it.

He was busy running away from the dog type beasts. Logan was doing his best to conserve the energy of his blasters since he didn't have an endless supply of backup crystals with him. While trying to find a way out, he would only fire when those beasts came so close that he had to defend himself.

Unfortunately, even after half an hour of running around, Logan didn't really get anywhere and the number of his pursuers hadn't decreased at all. His AI was still scanning the area, but nothing useful had come of it, up until now.

'Those beasts seem to be on the same level as Intermediate tier beasts, so I can finish them with a single blast in a vital spot, but I'm down to three replacement crystals.' Logan thought. 'Did Eno just want to see me survive the onslaught of beasts, simulating how people might come after me for his knowledge, is there something about it that I have yet to grasp?'

'Could there be someone behind those dog-like beasts? Something like a pack leader? Do I have to defeat that guy, to make the others stop?'

If he continued to waste energy on these smaller beasts, then when meeting with the stronger one, assuming there actually was one, he would eventually lose out. Logan tried to find another beast, but to no avail.

The cycle continued and Logan knew something had to change. He had only ten blasts left in his blaster before he had to recharge it. Then he would have to start fighting the beasts with his bare hands. Trying the same thing and getting no result Logan decided to run away from where the beasts were located.

They were quite fast, and eventually three stayed on his tail. One of them was running across the top of the junk pile, and when it caught up to Logan in his speed suit and was side by side, it leapt up in the air going for the attack.

'Here I thought you were smarter, you should have learned from your brethren that once you're in the air, it just makes it easier to hit you.' Logan thought.

With a headshot the beast was dead, but that's when Logan noticed that the other two had stopped following him. To be more precise, both of them stood on top of the junk piles and just looked at him.

'That's strange they have been following me for a while, so why stop now?' Logan wondered. 'Is this the end of their territory? Will I get somewhere else if I go in that direction?'

At first he kept his eye on them, taking a few careful steps back, yet they continued to just stare at him. Taking it one step further, he showed his back to them, taking a few more steps, before quickly turning around, having expected them to follow, but nothing of that sort had happened.

In fact, one of them seemed to have gone back, whereas the sole remaining one was looking from Logan to his partner, as if trying to decide who to follow. In the end, he decided against Logan.

As such, Logan walked through the junkyard but all of the pieces of scrap that were around seemed to be useless. He couldn't really make anything from them unless he activated his soul weapon, and that seemed like a waste.

After unsuccessfully searching for about an hour, Logan was starting to wonder why he hadn't seen anything else. He had been sure to encounter another type of monster, but after scanning for signs of life, the AI had found nothing at all.

He decided that he had no choice, but to turn around, and head back to where the hounds were.

'I must have missed something.'

Upon returning, he was unable to see the hounds, but stepping one foot into the area he was in before, and the piles of junk started to move again, realigning the dogs. Immediately they started to go after him.

'Let's test this!' Logan thought, turning back and running around. Then when they reached the same point as last time they stopped again.

'This is the only place with beasts that I've been able to find nearby, and those dogs, for whatever reason they stop there each time. I know that this isn't the territory of something else, so they must have some reason for not wanting to move too far away… are they protecting something? Richard had to have a reason for putting me here in the teleporter and not the rest of the planet. Something has to be there.' Logan concluded.

Running in again, Logan quickly blasted the guard dogs, and dealt with them quickly. Running through going deeper into the area he was in before, he was met with even more dogs. Now there was a group of five surrounding him. He fired off his blasters and a few shots missed while one managed to hit.

For the first time, they had gotten up close, so he immediately swung out his arm, allowing the dog to bite it. The metal casing around it fell off, revealing Logan's Dalki hand.

The next second Logan used his great strength to swing the dog into the others, hitting them away, but at the same time his blasters had run out. On top of that when he looked back up, as quick as he dealt with five of them, he could see another five, and more coming from a distance.

'I've never seen this many beasts in a single area before, and I already killed so many of them. How are there so many?!' Logan thought.

Desperately thinking that perhaps there was another teleporter somewhere in the area, Logan ran in again. He was down to his last remaining backup crystal and he would rather keep it from his suits. As such, he resorted to using his Dalki arm, yet the numbers of the dogs attacking him grew to twenty. Logan changed the spiders from a speed suit, into a defensive suit.

It was sort of blocking most of the attacks, and with his arm he could deal with them in a couple of hits. They were no match against a Dalki, but even then the numbers weren't decreasing and somehow they were increasing the further in he got.

''Even with the Dalki arm, I'm going to tire out eventually. They'll be able to get through to my armour. It doesn't look like there are stronger beasts than those! Do I just have to fight an army of them? Will it even stop if I kill a thousand of them?! You could have told me something more, Eno!' Logan was frustrated and taking out his frustration he continued to defeat the dogs.

It certainly was a tough battle, but it seemed more like a battle of endurance rather than strength. What was more frustrating for Logan was that even though he was racking his head trying to figure out how to solve this, he just lacked vital information about what the ancient vampire wanted from him.

'Fine, you want to test me out on my strength then so be it!' Logan thought, as he dived right into one of the junk piles and immediately pressed his hand against it, activating his soul weapon, he soon could control all the metallic components turning giving them minds similar to machines.

For a lack of time, he forewent turning them into spiders first and instead he started to turn the surrounding junk into three giant snakes.

"Get rid of them!" Logan shouted, and the giant snakes quickly followed their master's command. With their sheer size they were easily able to take out what felt like the endless wave of dogs.

Now with some guards on his side, Logan had some breathing space. He started to go to all the piles of rubbish in the nearby area and created more giant snakes out of them. His MC cells would soon run out without any beast crystals to utilise their power but that's when Logan discovered something.

All of the dogs seemed to originate from one particular trash pile, and they also seemed reluctant to leave it, despite the incoming snakes.

'So I was right, they're really protecting something and whatever it is, it has to be in there!'

Ordering a couple of the giant trash snakes he had created, they started to attack and Logan himself got involved fighting them as well. Eventually all of those surviving the trash pile were destroyed.

Using his ability again, instead of creating something from it, he decided to move it to the side, and that's when Logan could see it. Something looked to be growing out of the ground, similar to a giant hand but what struck his eye was what it was holding, a crystal.

It didn't seem like a beast crystal, yet at the same time it did. Staring into its pattern it looked like a crystal made from space itself.

Walking up to it, Logan touched it out of curiosity. Just to be safe, he touched it with his Dalki hand, but nothing happened. Carefully, he started to yank the crystal out from the ground. Surprisingly, it had been rooted more strongly than he had anticipated, forcing him to use all of his strength.

In an instant, howls from all over were heard at the same time.

"What is going on?" Logan asked.

"What you have in your hand, is one of the secrets of the world, knowledge that the humans once had lost."

Tuning back around, Logan could see an Eno Clone standing behind the strange hand. Logan wondered how and when he had gotten there, or if he had been hiding the whole time.

It was hard to tell if it was the same or a different clone.

"What is it?" Logan asked, more interested in the crystal than the antics of the old man.

"This is what you would call a 'Nest Crystal'. It's something even more valuable than a Demon tier crystal. It's the lifeblood of certain planets and it's what it used to create beasts."

The clone then held out his hand, offering it to Logan.

"You have successfully passed the test. Are you ready to learn more about this world?"

*****

# Chapter 1321 - Relying On The System
At the moment, Logan was being led by the clone through the junkyard to a different area. Cancelling his soul weapon, the giant snakes made from junk soon fell to the floor, and the beasts also seemed to no longer bother them as they continued to howl.

The new Nest crystal that Logan had discovered was still on his body, placed in his special toolbox attached to his trousers. He still had it on him for when Borden came along on journeys. It was also a good place to keep important things.

Honestly, Logan thought that perhaps after getting such a crystal, it would need to be handed back to Richard or the clone, but he had asked for no such thing. Still, he was fascinated about learning everything about it.

"A Nest crystal, in a place like this, so they're actually real?" Logan asked. He had heard a few things about a rumoured Nest crystal, but that was all it was. Some thought it was a myth. There were reports that some groups had seen them but never managed to get their hands on such a thing.

"You have your answer already." The clone replied. "Nest crystals are what give the energy to the beasts. It's a strange phenomenon, to say the least. We believe that the creatures on these planets were just regular animals like we have back on earth at some point in time.

"However, they were drawn to these mystical energies called the Nest crystals. The animals gave birth, laid their eggs next to these crystals, and eventually started to change, going through an evolution. They were born with crystals inside of their body, and they gained great power.

"The Nest crystal itself seems to adapt to the newly found beasts it has created and almost starts replicating them. Spawning them constantly at an incredible rate, and this is what we know as the beasts today."

Logan was thinking back to his test, how the beasts seemed to constantly be appearing.

"Are you saying the Nest crystals were the cause of all the beasts I fought? The fact that their numbers didn't dwindle was due to how fast they were being produced?"

"Correct. If you had continued to fight the beasts, it would have been endless, just like the energy in the crystal itself. It is also because of this fact that Nest crystals have been almost impossible for humans to find.

"Fighting countless waves of beasts or even coming across an area would put off most groups. In the first place, the beasts tend to try and hide or cover the nest crystal away from the eyes of others.

"And as you expect, this crystal, or these crystals, are one of the rewards that will help you in your fight. Unfortunately, Nest crystals are unable to be turned into beast weapons, but they have endless amounts of energy.

"A large ship would have to never gather any crystals again, only having to use one of these Nest crystals, but there are more uses than even that for it. To explain, Richard's ability of equivalent exchange, to use it, there would often be a cost associated with it.

"This cost could sometimes be in the forms of large energy, and when this was the case, Beast crystals could be used, and that includes Nest crystals."

Logan was figuring out how dangerous such a crystal was in the hands of someone like Richard. A Nest crystal, endless power that could produce beast after beasts.

"It broke the rules of your ability," Logan answered.

"Correct again, I can see why the original Richard has hope in you." The clone replied. "With a Nest crystal, one was able to use its energy again and again. It felt as if there was no cost to using the ability. However, there were some things that took even the entire crystal to use our powers."

Already Logan was learning so much, and with the Nest crystal in his possession, he wondered what could be done with them. He didn't have the equivalent exchange ability, but through his research, in the Dalki creation, he learnt there were other ways to use crystal energy.

For one, he wouldn't have had his problem with his blasters, his soul weapon could be used endlessly since it relied on the powers of the crystals, but both of those methods were selfish. Logan was thinking of something else.

He was pretty sure that both Jim and Richard had used these Nest crystals to produce the countless clones they had created. It was probably the same for the vampires. But there was a problem of a short life span with the clones.

That was because they were creating multiple clones with the energy of the crystal. Eventually, that energy would fade as there was no beast crystal in their body.

But what if a clone was created with the Nest crystal in their body, similar to beasts? Wouldn't they then be able to create a perfect clone?

"It is time for us to get the rest of your rewards." The clone had moved some scrap from one of the piles, and underneath there was a portal. He had his hand placed forward, offering the way for Logan, but Logan stopped just outside before going in.

"I know, you're not coming with me. Your duty ends here." Logan said, having figured out that this clone had been on this planet for a while. It was hard to explain, but he could tell it wasn't the same one in the room as him.

"I know you're not the real Richard, but I want to say something. I saw that you did a lot for my family…I want to thank you for helping them and for helping me. Learning about the Nest crystals, thinking about the possibilities that I could create with it, has brought back my passion."

With that said, the clone smiled, and Logan stepped through the teleporter. Logan was expecting to be returned to the black room and for the doors to open, but instead, he was transported to a lab of all things.

It was filled with giant monitors and countless terminals and servers all over the room.

'Is this all still on the ship?'

There was only one door in the room, but it remained closed. Logan could have probably opened it with his ability, but he decided to keep it closed for fear that he would be interrupting the others' tests.

'He said that I would be taken to a place where all the information is gathered, so is it all here. If I touch these objects, will I learn everything that Eno knew?'

This was somewhat what Logan had been waiting for, but now that he was here, it felt too easy, as if he was almost cheating in a game. He also had no idea what to expect.

'The Nest crystal was already a big find, but I have to learn more. There has to be more information about how to help out."

Touching just one of the servers in the room. All the information was downloading into Logan's head. His ability and mind quickly allowed him to process everything that he was learning. After a few minutes, he had gathered all the information, but he realised when touching it, that it was only a fraction of the information that was there.

'There is information on each and every one of these servers about different things. The cloning techniques, Magic, vampire history, human history, even information on Pure! Everything, everything is here. Who was Richard Eno?' We're all the questions running through Logan's head right now, but he knew that he was going to find out.

———

A while ago, Quinn had stepped onto the strange drawing in the room, and he had received a devastating message. He had an idea of what had happened, so immediately, he went to look at his system. The only thing was there was no system to bring up.

Once before he had experienced something similar to this, it was the first time he had met Richard and was what had put a bad taste in his mouth about the man in the first place. There was one thing he was sure about though, Richard could control the system.

"As a clone, I do not have Richards powers." The clone answered. "Which is why there had been some things that were prepared beforehand. For your test Quinn, Richard has observed that your fast growth in strength could only be really explained by one thing. The system that he and Vincent created together.

"However, the system was only a tool that was to teach a person how to use their vampire powers, to bridge the gap, the years of experience vampires had. Now you must fight with your own strength, without the help of the system."

Rising from the ground were several platforms, and with them, there were clones. Several clones of Richard himself. In total, six of them.

"Haha, so my test is fighting you, and you're saying I can go all out? You don't know how long I have been wanting to do this." Quinn said.

The test had begun, with one of the clones running towards him, activating the blood drill. Seeing this, Quinn was calm. He closed his eyes, gathering the large Qi energy in his body, and also chose to suppress the red energy.

Combining the red energy and Qi energy inside his body produced a stronger attack than using one energy or the other. Still, they also interfered with each other, not allowing the other one to use its special properties to the fullest. This was also the reason why Quinn had struggled to learn the third stage of Qi.

Now that he had a large amount of Qi, compared to his blood energy, he had figured it out, and to top it off, Qi was perfect against vampires.

The energy gathered in his fist, and the raw energy was almost physically able to be seen in a glowing orange colour. The clone was still a few feet away. With a snap of Quinn's hand, a loud bang was heard, and the clone had stopped in its tracks, falling to the floor.

It was dead, lying there on the floor.

"I know you by now, you were planning to kill all the clones anyway, and you wouldn't have let me leave this place until they were dead, but I think you got one thing wrong. I don't rely on the system."

*****

# Chapter 1322 - A New…
It was a strange feeling not being able to use the system for Quinn's skills. Before he would use the shadow, and even activate the blood abilities through the system. Now he could access none of it. Even when Eno had messed around with his system before he had only limited his skills, but this was more like the system was offline.

However, fighting against the clones there was no need for Quinn to use any of the skills in the system, he could beat them all just with the power of his Qi. Even Quinn didn't expect the third stage of Qi to work this well against Eno.

In a way, with Quinn's strength and power, there was virtually no way for them to counter the attack, unless they had an ability, skills or strong beast armour. Still, as the next clones came from behind Quinn raised a shadow, blocking their attacks, and then with the two in front of him, Quinn started to spin Blood drills, swinging a punch and hitting both of the clones who had performed Blood drills of their own.

What was unsurprising was that Quinn's power had won out against the Clone Enos, with the hands of both of them ripped to shreds. However, Quinn didn't stop his attack there, as he used his speed to get close to them. Lifting his leg he performed a kick with the power of Qi directly to their heads, finishing them both off.

It had been less than a minute, yet the number of clones had already dropped in half. When the shadow dropped down, the clones were ready to pile up on the Vampire Lord, yet they could see nothing… until Quinn appeared directly behind them, already with his hands through both of their chests.

This time he had used the second stage of Qi, to sharpen his finger tips so they were like claws, while also covering it with the third stage. It had allowed him to bypass any type of defence they might have mustered.

Quinn didn't go on the attack against the sole remaining survivor, because the clone itself just stood there, as if it was frozen or something in its body had short circuited.

"Will the test be over once I kill you or is there another part to it?" Quinn asked with a smirk on his face.

Hearing this question had managed to snap the clone back to its duty.

"The test…is over." The clone spoke as if it couldn't even believe it was saying those words. In reality, it wasn't that Clone Eno had never thought that Quinn would pass the test, he had just never thought that without the system Quinn was still this deadly.

"It seems like you don't really understand what just happened." Quinn spoke calmly, enjoying the feeling of stumping Richard Eno, even though it was just a clone of his. "Ever since I got the system, I had been afraid that there might come a time when I won't be able to use it. After the first time that Richard altered it, I knew that my fears weren't unfounded. If he could alter it, as its creator, it only seemed natural that he might have a way to do something worse."

"It was from then on that I chose to try to learn all the skills without using the system. There are still times and certain skills that I use for the system, but as you saw yourself, I'm far from useless, even without it!"

In a way, Quinn had also decided to test himself during the fight. He knew he could beat all the Eno clones, and he could have done so just using the third stage of Qi he had recently learned, but while fighting, he had chosen to use all of his skills without the system, to check on his progress in a real fight.

"We clones only have the memories up until the point that Richard chose to create us. That being said, I have a feeling that the original would also have been surprised how easy you have passed." The clone said. "No matter what, you always seemed to be an anomaly that we failed to predict. We didn't know what you would do, what path you would take or your emotions, and it wasn't just him."

"Anyway enough of that, it is now time for your reward for completing your task. Please step back into the marking once again."

Quinn did as he was asked, and soon he received a message from the system.

[System has been activated again]

Checking everything was okay, Quinn was happy to get it back. Although he had just proven that he didn't have to rely on the system, he had already gotten so used to it, that it had felt strange with it being absent.

"Although this test was to see how you did without the system it doesn't mean the system doesn't offer you certain benefits. When creating the system, the original Eno did put a hope in it. He wasn't sure how much it would help, but Eno was always a person with many plans more than one."

"Which is why he decided if you passed the test, this should be your reward." The clone stated as he held out his hands.

"It's a hidden feature, that will only activate once the system hears this phrase from his voice. The phrase is; 'System unlock.'"

As if reacting to those words, Quinn had received a new system message that appeared bright green but he didn't quite understand the words he was seeing.

[The System has been fully unlocked.]

[Tht system grants you power]

[All available stats have been boosted to their maximum]

[Your body can feel the energy through you]

The system was right, Quinn could feel his body changing, as if it was breaking down and regenerating on the spot.

'What, just what did Richard do to the system for it to allow to do this?' Quinn thought.

[Strength 100]

[Agility 100]

[Stamina 100]

[Charm 100]

The reward was a max out of all of his base stats. Quinn couldn't believe it, with a few simple words he had achieved what might have taken him years, but he did realise it hadn't improved everything.

For example, Quinn's blood control was at 184, although it was above a hundred for blood control he gathered this was quite a low number. At the same time Quinn could see that his level was still at 70 and it looked like there was still an exp bar. Part of him had been hoping that upon reaching level 70 that it would allow him to reach the next evolution, but sadly nothing exceptional had happened.

"Wait, if I can still level up, can these stats be further improved?" Quinn asked out loud, as he realised the possibility.

"No." The clone instantly shattered his hopes in that regards. "For your stats themselves this is the highest they will go. The number in the first place is based on your potential and the system has made it so your body is now the best it can be.

"However, you can still improve your shadow skills and blood skills, I am not able to help in that department, maybe there are still more things to their system for it to grow. As you know, the system itself is something that has surpassed our expectations."

With that done, it was time for Quinn to leave the black room. A light lit up in the room revealing a door. Sliding down Quinn was free to exit and so he did, without turning back or looking at the clone.

He had already said his goodbyes to Richard, it was time for him to do what he needed to do. After going through the door, he had entered another hallway. After a short walk the door at the end opened and Quinn had entered the room.

"Quinn, you passed." Mona congratulated him, just thankful that finally someone else was in the room with her.

Quinn was about to reply, when he saw what else was in the room.

"Is that…Oscar!?" Quinn asked, seeing the strange drifting body. He could tell instantly something was up. Although it had Oscar's body it just didn't quite feel like it was actually him.

Seeing that it was in eno's lab, and Quinn knew that Oscar was already on the bridge of death when he posed to him through Shrio last time, he used the Inspect skill.

[A Dullahan]

*****


# Chapter 1323 - The Headless
As soon Quinn saw Oscar's apparent body, he knew something was wrong. The last time he had seen Oscar, it felt like there was no chance for him to come back, nor any wish for him to come back either. So it made him wonder just what had happened, so his body had gotten in the hands of Richard Eno.

'What have you done…' Quinn thought.

Using his inspect skill, he could see that his hunch was correct. Oscar was no longer a human. Instead, his inspect skill told him he was something known as a Dullahan. However, this was a word or a creature Quinn was unfamiliar with.

"It looks like you know a little more than I do," Mona said, standing by Quinn's side. She had made the assumption due to his shocked expression, but perhaps that was just the fact that he had seen Oscar in such a state.

The two of them were looking at the head rather than the body. It looked like Quinn's entrance had grabbed his attention since it was no longer staring at Mona but just Quinn.

Seeing this, Quinn moved his hand from side to side, but the eyes didn't follow, but taking a step to the left and right, it did.

"What is he looking at?" Quinn wondered.

"Maybe it wants another head buddy?" Mona joked.

It was then that Quinn started to move just his head, rather than his body, even bending forward. The joke that Mona made didn't seem so funny anymore. Since its eyes had just followed Quinn's head.

'Vincent, do you know what it is?' Quinn asked, hoping to answer Mona's question. Even though he knew the name of the subject, since it wasn't created by Quinn himself, he was unable to see information like when he would create a subclass.

'The headless horseman or woman.' Vincent answered. 'It was a legend told, or a story that was told when I was very young. However, even to vampires, such a creature is more mythical than anything. I'm not sure if it's a vampire subclass. At least one hadn't been created during my time, and there were no records of such a thing.

"However, we have learnt that even Dragons exist, which I would have thought was mythical as well. For as long as vampires have lived, we have never seen such creatures as Dragons, yet we are.

'It makes me wonder if Eno tried to create an entirely new creature, similar to what Jim did, or if what we are seeing here is a legendary creature being reborn. Perhaps just like dragons, they had died out, and Richard had found a way to bring one back or create one through Oscar.'

Although Quinn had learnt a little more about the Dullahan, he didn't learn about its nature, powers or ability. Quinn had repeated to Mona what he knew, and she didn't seem to have any knowledge of the creature either.

"So what do we do now? It's Oscar, we should take him out, right? After all, Richard said he had prepared rewards that would help us, and this should be my reward."

Hearing this, Quinn wanted to ask Mona what her trial was, but decided against it, in case it was something personal. Maybe he would ask once he learnt about Logan's who they had yet to see.

"I'm not sure if he's friendly or not. The way he's looking at me is giving me goosebumps. Let's just try to figure out how to get out first. We won't leave without him, don't worry." Quinn answered.

The two of them looked for a way out, but just like Mona, they could only find the other doors that neither of them had come through from. There were two more, which was strange in itself.

"When I completed my task, I came through this door, so maybe Logan is still doing him, and then he will come through one of the others. If we wait for him, maybe he will eventually come through one of the doors." Quinn suggested.

Mona agreed that the logic was sound, so they waited and waited, but there was no sign of Logan, and neither of the doors were opening. Since both of their tests were so quick, they were wondering if Logan was struggling to make it or if he had completed his task or not.

As time went on, Quinn was tempted to use his shadow abilities and enter the room.

"Maybe it's because I haven't accepted my reward." Mona eventually said, making Quinn forget about his previous urge.

Since they might leave the room anyway and with nothing else for them to do, Quinn thought that they could try to free Oscar regardless. In the first place, Quinn had gotten a boost from his reward, so he was sure that Richard wasn't lying about these rewards helping them. On top of that, if a fight was to break out, was the Dullahan a creature capable of stopping him, even with his stat boost?

Oscar was strong, but a lot of his strength came from his soul weapon and Demon tier weapon, both with which he no longer had.

Out of the two parts in separate containers, Mona and Quinn agreed to free the body first. The head just felt creepy. On one of the computers, there was a clear button to open the two glass containers.

One on the left and one on the right. Assuming the one on the left was connected to the left container, they pressed down on the button. The glass container immediately started to drain. Once it did, the glass began to sink down below into the ground. And the wires connected to the body were ejected.

'Okay, gotta be ready for anything.' Quinn thought, activating his shadow and keeping it hovering by his back.

When the body was free, it started to move around and stretched a couple of times. It looked like someone who had been stuck or asleep in the same potion for a long time. The body was muscular and completely naked, so they could see everything in the flesh, but something strange happened.

From its neck upwards, a bright blue mist started to show. It looked like a flame, yet they could also tell that it wasn't a flame. A few seconds later and it snapped its fingers. The light blue mist spread to its body and started to materialise an armour set on itself and a sword behind its back.

'What is this? Is it something similar to my shadow ability? Where I can keep items in my dimensional space. Did Eno also prepare all this for him?'

Using his inspect skill again, Quinn wanted to see the stats of the armour and the weapon he had just summoned. Still, he was in for a surprise as the items themselves were not beast armour.

'Is this possible? Is Oscar now some type of god?' Was Quinn's thought. After learning of the gods, and dragons, it wasn't something that he would put past him. Maybe Richard had captured one of the gods' dormant souls and placed it into Oscar.

"Oscar, can you hear us? Are you friendly?" Mona shouted out to the body.

However, instead of answering them or walking over to where they were, it turned around and looked towards its head. It walked up to the glass, and the head's eyes looked at its own body.

"What's it goi-"

A smashing sound was heard. The glass container broke with the Dullahan, pushing it. It then grabbed its own head by the top of its hair and pulled it towards itself.

"Is it going to wear it? Or put it back on, I mean." Quinn thought, carefully watching its every move. Strangely, it didn't attempt to put its head back on the mist. Instead, it just grabbed the head and tucked it in by its side.

"Can you speak?" Quinn asked.

Lifting up the head, it shook it, indicating that it couldn't. Even though the head had a mouth, with the creepy smile still there.

"Are you going to hurt us?" Mona asked.

Using the head again, it shook it, indicating it was a no. Both of them looked at each other and were thankful that this was the case. They wanted to ask it more questions since it seemed to understand them but thought it would be hard to talk this way.

"Maybe we can get it a pen and paper, and we can see if it can talk properly to us, or a tablet or something," Quinn said.

While making this suggestion, they could see that Oscar was walking towards one of the doors, and unlike with them, the door had started to open.

"Huh, what wait let's follow him. Maybe that's where Logan will be," Quinn said, and the two quickly followed but also made sure not to get too close to the headless person, just in case he would turn on them.

When they entered the room, though, there was no sign of Logan. Instead, it was something they both didn't expect to see. A creature of some sort that was trapped in a cage.

"A horse?" Mona said.

That's when it clicked in Quinn's head from what Vincent had told them.

"The headless horseman."

******

# Chapter 1324 - The Other Kings
The creature stuck in the cage was without a doubt, a horse. The only thing was it didn't look like a regular horse. It was black in colour but not just black like fur from horses on earth. This was the darkest black that one could see. Not an ounce of light was being reflected off its fur. It was nearly impossible to differentiate from its Maine and hair on its body when together.

If it was nighttime, it would stand out for how dark it was, but that wasn't the only thing that they would be able to see. For the Horse had red eyes. They were the same shade as vampires.

"That horse, it doesn't feel like a beast," Mona said. From her experience of using her ability through the years, she could almost tell in an instant whether this was something her powers could work on.

'That's because it is not a beast.' Vincent said in Quinn's head. 'This creature has more signs of it being familiar, but I have never seen one like this before…perhaps…' Vincent had paused as if he was going to say more, but he didn't want to shout out baseless theories and worry Quinn or give him wrong information.

It was then that Quinn himself could feel a tingling feeling on his back. Coming from a certain marking. It was Boney. His own familiar was reacting. His marking felt like it was trying to break free from his body, and at the same time, the horse stood up on its rear legs and neighed loudly.

It wasn't a high pitched neigh like usual horses did. Instead, the sound produced had a low frequency, so low that the ground was shaking from the bass in the horse's voice.

"That's kinda creepy, and why is there a horse acting crazy." Mona wondered.

Quinn knew it had something to do with his familiar, but he didn't know why. The mist from his back started to appear, floating outward and moving towards the horse's location.

"What are you doing? Come back!" Quinn ordered. He feared that there might be a confrontation.

At the same time, Oscar moved forward and drew his sword from his back, ready to fight what was about to come his way. Although it might be interesting to see the Dullahan's strength at the moment, Quinn knew full well how strong the Boneclaw was, and everyone here was meant to be on the same side. They didn't want to hurt a potential alley soon after receiving one.

"I do not… I do not wish to hurt them!" Quinn shouted even louder, and this time with anger in his voice.

Before the mist could form, it started to go back to where it was, back to Quinn's body.

'Is that the first time the Boneclaw has listened to me? Will it continue to listen to me?' Quinn had neglected the Boneclaw, because it mostly chose to come out when it wished. He knew it fed on his darkest desire, which most of the time was when he was filled with anger, and it had helped him out in dire situations.

But whenever Quinn had asked for its aids in fights, even when he was on the island, it never seemed to respond. Still, if it listened to this, then maybe the Boneclaw was starting to come around to Quinn.

'I have a theory about the reaction, but I can not confirm.' Vincent said. 'You should know that familiars do not belong to our world. Vampires lure them over with a scent of their blood, or at times there are families that just wish to live near the vampires. It has been like this for the longest time. No matter where the vampires would move to, there would be familiars that would cross over and live in a similar area to ourselves.'

Quinn remembered Leo and the others talking about their experience in the familiar world. It was an interesting tale, to say the least. He also remembered Leo saying that they fed off Qi energy, so it was strange that familiars chose to live near vampires rather than humans, but the vampires hadn't figured out everything about them. There was one person who had done a lot of research on them though.

'In the familiar world, there are beings that even other familiars respect. They have great power, and they have been granted the title king. I believe the reason why the horse was reacting and perhaps the Bone claw on your back is due to both of them being kings.'

Hearing the explanation, it sounded like the Horse in front of them was a familiar that was just as great as his Boneclaw. The questions were how Richard was able to catch such a being and what Oscar was planning to do with it.

Once it had reached the cage, Oscar held out his hand and started to stroke the top of its nose a few times. It then lifted its head and placed its forehead against the horses. A few seconds later, the horse's body started to light up.

It too started to turn into a black coloured mist, and it all began to head towards Oscar's forehead. Eventually, the horse had disappeared in front of their eyes, and now there was a diamond shape marking on top of Oscar's forehead.

Now, Oscar turned to look at Quinn and Mona again. They jolted backwards, seeing the creepy smile. Even though they had seen it before, it was still unsettling to them. It walked towards the pair, and they both prepared themselves again.

But it never touched its sword and just stood still in front of them, as if it was waiting for the two of them to do something.

"I guess this thing really won't attack us. That's good news." Mona said.

'I wonder how he can use that horse.' Quinn thought. 'Was the horse similar to his Boneclaw. Since it was a strong familiar, it might even be hard for the Dullahan to use it. Why did it even select the Dullahan and say yes?'

'Maybe, the special creature has a close connection with horses. I know it is a familiar, but who knows.'

At that moment, the sound of the door opening in the other room was heard. All three ran back into the room where Oscar was originally. They found out that the final door that had yet to open, had been opened.

They all went to take a look, and that's when they could see that they had entered some type of experiment lab. There were several servers all over the place on the ground and more. Sniffing the air, Quinn could tell that there was a human inside.

He quickly ran to see if Logan was okay, and although he only had light wounds on his body, for some reason, he was lying on the floor with his head staring up to the ceiling, doing nothing.

"Logan, what's wrong, is everything okay?" Quinn asked. His eyes looked somewhat different. His pupils had shrunken. It felt like he wasn't even registering that Quinn was there.

"Quinn, I can hear your voice." Logan said with a smile. It was starting to make Quinn wonder what was with everyone he met today having an unsettling smile. "I did it, I learnt about all the information in all the servers. I learned about them all, and it was my reward."

Seeing how Logan was and how strange he was reacting, Quinn was slightly worried, but as long as he was in good health, they could help him through whatever they needed to get through.

"You don't understand Quinn, I learnt about everything. The Nest crystals, how to create clones, the truth of human history. I learnt about what Eno did, what he was trying to do, and I also learnt about…the vampires. I learnt about how the vampires were made and how it all started."

The last words Logan spoke had caught not only Quinn's attention but also Vincent's, for even a great and old vampire like him didn't know about the vampire's beginnings.

*****

# Chapter 1325 - Seeing Them Again
Although Quinn was greatly interested in the information Logan had to share, it seemed like Logan was out of it for the time being. Even he was struggling to process everything that was going through his head. The problem was, this was the last room, and there were no more doors.

The ship was large from the outside, so they knew there had to be more rooms than this. Yet, if they just followed where they had come from, it would only lead them back to where their ship was currently at the moment.

Quinn was hoping with the information Logan had, that he would be able to lead them in the right direction to try and find more hidden gems on the ship.

"Where should we go from here?" Quinn asked.

Hearing these words, Logan stood up on his own from the ground he was on. He was no longer looking at the ceiling and instead started to walk towards one of the large control panels.

"There is nothing else on this ship that is worth using, but before we leave, Le- I mean Richard wanted me to show you this," Logan said. "This is also part of your reward Quinn. He wanted you to also know his original sin, but I wanted to show you something else before that."

A strange ball-like device started to drop down from the ceiling. It had several lights and strange components on it. The next second, the entire room had changed, taking them back to a certain point in time. Logan had experienced this before, but the others had not. They were currently in an augmented reality room. When Logan had learned about his family's history and their past, they had created a video log for him.

One could record words and details of specific events based on one's memories. Using all this information, the imagery from the mind could be uploaded. One could even create movies easily this way, just with their imagination. The AI would do its best to recreate scenes as if playing a movie to the person they wished to see, only they were in the film themselves.

Suddenly, the room had changed. They looked to be in some type of house. It was empty, mostly filled with grey colours, and there was carpet on the floor with a sofa. The sound of a crying baby was heard. The mother held the baby in its hands as it swung it back and forth, and the father tried to reassure the baby that everything was going to be okay.

"What is this?" Quinn asked, looking at the images, for some reason, he wanted to reach out and touch the two parents looking after the baby. He felt like he knew them, yet at the same time didn't.

"I would advise you not to move or try to touch anything," Logan stated. "We are still in the same room, but everything you see is being projected. So although we can't see it, there are still the servers and other things in this place that you could run into.

"Honestly Quinn, I don't know how much Eno wanted me to tell you or whether he wanted me to tell you anything about this. I have information with me that I know could be dangerous in the wrong hands. For example, did you know that beasts used to roam Earth in the past? There used to just be several pieces of large contents floating about.

"They had also succeeded in mixing beasts and humans in the past before the Dalki, and the world even had powers such as magic. Yet, all of this information was lost but kept here at the same time. The beasting process, as they called it, was even information that Jim had used to successfully create the Dalki."

It was hard for Quinn to even keep up with what Logan was saying or imagine just how much he had learned. It was no wonder he seemed to be out of it when they had found him.

"This Quinn, I thought you deserved to know this. This here, are your parents Quinn, and the baby is you."

When Quinn was a young boy, his parents had died during the first Dalki war. He had found memories of them, but as the years went by, he couldn't remember what they looked like. For some reason, there were no photos of them either.

Yet now he could see them both cleary.

"Both of them were so beautiful," Quinn said, with a tear falling down his cheek. "How did they make an ugly baby like me." Quinn thought, thinking about his appearance before he had become a vampire.

However, there soon was one person who had entered the room.

"I see both of you are doing well." The man said, sitting down on a sofa opposite them. The person had walked straight through Quinn, and for a second, the particles dispersed and soon reappeared, forming his body. The person was Richard.

'Richard, Richard knew my parents, what!' Quinn thought.

"Yes, he is a quick learner. Just this morning, he nearly said, Dad!" His father said.

"Honey, that's ridiculous. He's only two weeks old. That would be impossible." His mother replied.

"A Quick learner is the trait of a certain person I used to know a long time ago. I'm proud to know that his and my blood run through this person's veins." Richard said with a smile.

The scene then started to warp and change from there without much being said.

"What, wait!" Quinn called out, running trying to grab his parents, but soon his hand hit something solid and hard. For a second, the blue particles broke up, showing that he had hit one of the giant servers in the room, and then the vision started to change again.

"Quinn, there weren't many interactions in Eno's mind that I could show of your parents, but I thought that you deserved to see them again," Logan explained. "As someone who has recently lost his parents, I can somewhat understand how you feel.

"Still, whenever you and Eno spoke, he always seemed surprised to see you, or it was unexpected, but the more I looked through his memories, I would frequently see him meet with a certain individual. The Bliss person you spoke off, and not only recently, but it seems that the two have known each other for a very, very long time.

"Eno and Bliss worked together in hopes to protect the world. Although we may never understand why Bliss wishes to protect the Earth, I thought that we might be able to find Richards reason, but it never did come to light. The memories he stored here were all from the day he had become a vampire, and there is none past it.

"There are some things, some disastrous things I have seen him do during his time, one of them involved the Blade family, but it all seemed to be due to the words of Bliss. He trusted her every word. Still, it seemed like although they were able to fix current solutions, ironically, it was almost as if they forgot to think far ahead into the future. Their solutions to the problems would sometimes cause even more problems, and Eno felt guilty for that."

The scene around them changed, and Quinn could be seen as a young boy. Due to the war, children were sent out to a Shelter together. Quinn had his own room, but he didn't really get on with the other kids, so he stayed in it most of the time.

Young Quinn was sitting in his bed, not doing much.

Quinn didn't need the video to show him what happened in this scene because this memory was ingrained in his head.

A knock was heard at the door, and young Quinn rushed to open it up. Expecting to see his parents had returned but instead, he saw what looked like a man in a military suit.

"This is the day…I found out my parents died in the war." Quinn said.

Mona and Logan were watching everything carefully, and they could see the heartbroken young Quinn crying, falling to his knees. Mona was also feeling heartache, remembering a similar situation herself. It was then that the man had handed Quinn a book, the book that started it all.

"Why…why are you showing me this, Logan!" Quinn asked. This was the most painful memory for him, and now he had to relive it.

Logan didn't say anything and allowed the scene to play out. Instead of following Quinn though, it followed the strange soldier. Eventually, the soldier left the room and quickly ran until it was on the roof of the building they were on. The soldier's face started to change, warping into another person…Brock.

"I did as you asked. He has received the book." Brock said.

A man who was looking out turned around, revealing that it was Richard Eno.

"Good, that young boy from now on will live a hard life, but he must survive. I will do everything I can to protect the Talen bloodline. That family, our family, I owe them both too much having raised them in this hell. Make sure everything is taken care of for him.

"Give him a place to live, send him enough money to do as he wishes and make sure he doesn't find out that it is coming from us," Richard said.

It was then that Quinn realised that all his suspicions were correct. He had learnt that children who had lost their parents were usually forced to live on the beast planets or those with no money since they were cheaper than on Earth. Yet Quinn had been able to live life on Earth. He thought it was due to the government supplying all children with this benefit. This was what he was told, but now he knew everything was Richard Eno's doing. He had been looking out for him from the very beginning.

"I know you disliked the person, and honestly, if I had to show you everything he did, it would take years to, and even with everything I know, I can't tell if he is a good person or a bad, but one thing for sure. He cared about you and your family. Even more so than his own purer Bloodline. He took a deep interest when your mother met your father." Logan said.

"I don't fully understand why, but Quinn, I know you know more about your past, so perhaps learning about how Eno came to be a vampire, you will get your answer," Logan said as the scene started to change once again. Back to when Eno was for a few seconds still a human.

******

# Chapter 1326 - Eno's Sin
The scenery in the room was drastically changing, but unlike what they could see before this time, everything in it was almost unrecognisable. The walls looked to be made of an old stone. A wooden table appeared, and the room was a mess filled with scrolls all over the place.

It was clear they were not in a period that wasn't close to their current one.

Even more so, there were strange drawings all over the room, patterns of circles with weird characters and more illustrations.

'That looks similar to what took my system powers away.' Quinn thought, looking at it.

While the machine made the room, Vincent, who was able to witness everything Quinn could, was even more excited than him. If he had a body, he would be shaking head to toe. This was because they were about to witness a time when Richard Eno wasn't a vampire.

Richard Eno was one of the Original vampires. The start of the families and the beginning of everything for the vampire race. Their history had never been told or passed on for how they came to be. It was something that Vincent thought he would never be able to find out or know about in his lifetime, which was why he also chose to never pursue such a thing.

Soon though, they could see two people created by the simulation program, and they were those they had recently come to know. The people who had been projected into the room were Bliss and Richard. It was strange because Richard actually looked like an older version than what he knew him as today.

Thinking back, Quinn remembered that it was the same with Leo. After he had been turned, his appearance was younger than before.

While Bliss appeared to be far younger, someone who was barely an adult. There was something about the air around her… that annoyed Quinn nearly as much as when he saw Richard. However, as soon as the scene started to play out, there was something that shocked both Quinn and Mona.

"Lenny, I need to speak to you. The beasting process you went through. It will not be enough for you to be able to do anything." Bliss said. "I know you want to go out and fight against the shadow plague, but if you do, there is a good chance that you will end up dead."

This was a shocking fact, not that his name wasn't Richard. Quinn had somewhat guessed that perhaps Eno had gone through many different names during his time, but he thought at least his real name would be what the vampires knew him by as well. Just what was real about him in the first place, Quinn wondered, and what was going on in the past.

"Are you sure that Ray can deal with them? Even in your visions, he doesn't turn up! Which means we have to do something that not even you can predict." Lenny then went ahead and grabbed a crystal. It was a crystal Quinn had never seen before, but Logan had recently learned of it, as one of the Nest Crystals.

At the same time, Quinn had heard a familiar name, the name of his ancestor, who was Ray, in the tablet.

'Wait, Richard knew who Ray was, but he didn't seem to have any idea he was in the tablet. Did Ray do that without telling anyone in his past?'

Not being able to understand the actions or what was going on with his ancestor at the time, he decided to continue watching.

"Remember what you told me," Lenny said, placing the crystal down on the floor in one of the strange circles Quinn had recognised. "That there are different types of gods. Some lay in human bodies, but there are also those that belong to the world of the dead.

"We need strong power. When I saw the shadow summon that Dragon. I have an idea of what they are trying to do. They are trying to contact the other side and bring them back.

If we can contact one of the gods from the land of the dead, then maybe we can win this war." Lenny said.

Bliss was absolutely stunned, but she could tell that she was unable to stop him. Lenny had already placed his hands on the Nest crystal, connecting with the other side. The circle started to light up, and the image from there started to change once again.

"For some reason, it seems like Richard's memories are unable to be accessed from there. It seems like whatever he saw on the other side has been wiped from his head." Logan explained. "But there is one thing that we can be sure about. He succeeded that day, he had obtained great power from one of the gods, and that was what had turned him into what he was… a vampire.

"You see, Richard wasn't just an original. He was the first Original. Knowing this later on, he had decided to change his name to Eno, which spelt backwards was One. As in the first vampire. It was only later that Richard found out that gaining such a power he had brought a plague into this world."

Listening to Logan's explanation, that had explained how Richard had become a vampire, but what about the other Originals?

"I have no footage to show you, but I can answer the question you are probably thinking, for Richard had eventually found out the answer himself. When connecting with the other world, he had opened a gate, and Richard wasn't the only one affected at the time. There were others as well.

"After learning what he had done, and how he had summoned a curse upon the others, he journeyed to gather the rest that had been affected. Finding them and trying to help them, grouping them together."

It was here that Quinn realised why Eno always tried to protect the humans from the vampires. Because the creation of the vampires in the first place was his fault, but he couldn't just get rid of them. Still, knowing what they had eventually become, Richard could never rest, always looking over them.

"Wait, Logan, but what about Arthur? He had become original at another time. How did that happen?" Quinn asked.

"That…" Logan said. "The whole thing, it was something that was orchestrated by Bliss. She had seen a future where the vampires rampage and rule over the humans. In order to stop this, she came to Eno for help. As I said, they always created solutions for the current problem, always to create more for the future.

"With her powers and the powers of the Nest crystal, learning from their past mistakes, they were able to open the path to the other side, without it leaking out into the world. Making Arthur into an original, someone who was meant to keep all of the vampires in check for the rest of eternity, but you know how all of that went."

Now Quinn was starting to understand why even his ancestor had such a disliking for this Bliss character. Always meddling into things and, in a way, forcing others to act to her will. He wondered if she had done something similar to Ray, and perhaps one day, Quinn could hear the tale from him himself.

"And that is Richard's tale of how the original vampires came to be. I'm not sure if you know why Richard wished to help you and your family so much. Even when learning about the vampire's past, there were things that seemed to be missing. It seemed even Richard didn't want everything about the world recorded." Logan said.

Logan could have gone into more detail into specific points. When the world forgot about magic, how to create clones and more, but this was the information he needed to protect now. Saying too much would just put others in unseen danger for no reason. He now knew why his test was a test of strength and where he needed to improve and continue his family's legacy of continually learning more.

Thinking about everything. Quinn thought of one thing. Ray Talen, his ancestor, must have saved them during their time, and that was what Richard was in debt to him for. At some point, his family line and Ray's family line must have mixed with his mother and father. Giving him both the Eno blood and the Talen blood in his veins.

What Quinn didn't know, and he wished to know, was about Richard's or Lenny's past. What drove him so much to seek out such power in the first place. When looking at the image before he had contacted the other side, it seemed like there was pure hatred and a desire for revenge.

Thinking about this, Quinn soon felt the mask that he would attach to his side vibrate. It was a new one since he gave the last one to Alex for emergency situations. It had the same design but didn't come with the benefits.

Placing it over his face, Quinn could tell that the one calling him was Sam.

"Quinn, you answered, thankfully you did. I have news, I finally received word back from Paul and Leo, but it's not good news…" Sam reported.

*****

# Chapter 1327 - I Nominate…
Before the events that had occurred on Blade island, Erin and Leo had decided to head back to the vampire world. They did so after receiving their weapons in the hopes to aid Paul and the tenth family in whatever they thought might come.

They were unaware of the situation, but Paul had received their call, giving them hope that not too much could have happened in the week while they were away.

The two found themselves in the familiar tenth castle. Quickly, they both observed the castle area to see if everything was okay. The castle was intact, and the people inside seemed to be fine from sensing thier aura.

"It seems not too much has happened since we left," Leo commented.

In front of them were Paul, Xander and Timmy. These three as well as Ashley, were the backbone of the tenth castle and its people while everyone else was away. However, after Leo had said these words, they could feel that something was up.

"Unfortunately, things are fine in the castle, but the settlement, the vampires and the pooling area, we can't say the same for," Paul replied. "The settlement was attacked. Muka said that he would pass the message of the Dalki being on this planet, but it seems like he was unaware of the strength and threat they possed and hadn't done it soon enough. For while you guys were away, the settlement had suffered from an attack…"

Paul explained the details, giving them an overview of the situation of what had happened. Muka had been busy trying to see just who they could pull over to their side. They needed to find out two things, what exactly Bryce was doing with the missing people, and when it did come to light, those that would be willing to vote him out of his position.

He needed to be careful about this, for if one of the families found out what Muka was trying to do, his head would be off quicker than any of the leaders in existence.

Days went past, and eventually, the attack from the Dalki had occurred. It was only a force of around fifty of them. Far smaller than any of the attacks that had happened on the planets owned by the humans, but this force was slightly different.

They were filled with three spikes and two spikes, and hardly any one spiked Dalki could be seen. With their great strength and the fact that the vampire settlement was arrogant that nothing would attack them. They were able to leap through the forest and directly land in the settlement itself.

The vampires tried to attack, most of them not noticing what had suddenly appeared. They thought it was some type of beast and used their blood powers. However, for the pooling area, the vampire's blood powers weren't strong enough to pierce a three spiked Dalki's skin, and the two spikes that were injured just grew in strength.

The pooling area was in a panic. Most of the inner castle areas refused to let those in from the pooling area until they fully grasped the situation. All apart from the tenth castle and thirteenth castle.

The thirteenth allowed for all those belonging to their family in the pooling area to enter the inner castle for the time being. The stronger vampires would help them. As for the tenth castle. Their fortifications had done them well.

The towers attacked any Dalki that came their way, and they had strong walls, seeing this. Vampires not only form the tenth family, but also other members from other families begged to be allowed to enter, and in the end, due to the situation. Paul had accepted.

Once those in the castle and from the king's palace got into action, they were able to somewhat turn the tide, beating a few of the Dalki.

Still, before they could do serious damage to the attacking force forces, they all suddenly retreated back into the forest.

The settlement and the castles weren't the same after the attack. The vampires were frightened about what happened, filled with questions about what those creatures were, and the worst part was, they hadn't received any answers.

With the possible ex-leader of the punishers about and now this, the vampires were even scared of leaving their homes for the first time.

"The Dalki really did attack then. Did they really not know what was going on in the human world? At how much we were struggling, were they really that arrogant that they felt they were never a threat in the first place!" Erin complained, remembering the first time she had met with the Dalki.

In a way, the vampire's situation now was similar to when the Dalki first came to earth. The thing was, humans had no clue about their existence; they had an excuse, but the vampires didn't. The leaders, the king, they all knew about the Dalki but chose to ignore the problem.

Even Muka, who seemed to be more of a sensible leader, was blinded this time by the news they had brought.

"Does that mean that there are currently other family members in the tenth castle at the moment?" Leo asked.

The two by Paul's side nodded, and it seemed like there was more to it.

"At the moment, problems are being brought up every day because of the families. Living in the pooling area and mixing in with those from the inner castle, there are daily disputes." Timmy said. "Due to Quinn's system of making those that aren't just strong important members of the tenth family, they have gotten into more scuffles than expected. The other families are not used to our ways."

There was a lot to think about, and Leo had his own opinions on what the Dalki were planning to do. The attack wasn't a full on attack, and the attack also seemed to coincide with Arthur's plan, which made it seem more likely that Arthur was working with the Dalki.

"Actually, there are some people that I would like you to meet," Paul said. "There was a certain someone that was insistent that you get brought along for the discussions that are about to take place. As for you, Erin, I know your strength and it seems you have brought quite the weapon back with you this time."

Erin was surprised that even in its new sheath, Paul was able to tell what the weapon was, but since he was one of the few that were close to Oscar when he had the weapon, it made sense.

The sheath that had been made still carried the shape of the demon tier weapon after all.

"I was hoping you could help Timmy and Xander stop whatever is going on in the tenth castle." Paul requested.

Erin looked at Leo for permission. Of course, she didn't mind helping out the tenth family, but Paul asked her to fight against other vampires. She had always had Leo by her side in case anything went wrong, but this time she wouldn't.

"You have shown great improvement. In the end, you are the one that controls you, and now it is time for you to do so." Leo said, walking off with Paul.

The two of them headed to the throne room in the tenth castle, which came as a surprise because Leo could already tell that there were others on the other side of the door. None of them were weak either.

As the doors opened, one person immediately stood up from their seat at the grand table.

"Leo!" Silver called out, happy to see him. "It seems you have come back in good health."

There were a few of the vampire leaders in the room, all gathered in the tenth castle. It was hard for any vampire to believe that this would happen a few years ago, yet here they were.

Silver, the thirteenth leader Lee, Jim Talen the fourth leader, the fifth leader Sunny Kent, and the ninth leader Muka were present, all sitting down.

"Remember how I said that Muka had gone to try and gather those that might listen to him? For now, these are the ones he has managed to convince. The new leaders that have come to their position are hard to approach for the time being." Paul explained.

Muka cleared his throat, insinuating there was something else he wanted to say and stood up.

"There is a reason why we have chosen to gather at the tenth castle as well," Muka said, walking towards Leo. "Now that both the vampire knights have returned, I think it is safe to tell you our plan. Even if everything goes smoothly, one thing that will be undecided in all of this. It is who is fit to be the next vampire king or queen.

"In order for Bryce to be replaced, there needs to be a replacement. We have discussed this amongst ourselves, who would be fit for the role. At the moment, there is one family that the vampires are growing trust in day by day, a family that had saved the vampire settlement from its doom. The tenth family.

"Our wish and our plan is to make… Quinn Talen, the leader of the Tenth family, the next vampire king." Muka stated.

# Chapter 1328 - Out Of The Tenth Castle!
Erin, along with Timmy and Xander, got to work immediately. While the others had left the room to discuss whatever needed to be done, the three of them had left the castle to make rounds in the inner castle area.

"So tell me, what exactly do we need to do?" Erin asked.

During the walk, Timmy couldn't help but stare at Erin. She was a beauty in every sense of the word, and now that she was in the Vampire World her hair was jet black, rather than the usual blonde, crossing off every checkmark for his ideal girl.

She was straightforward, strong and independent, yet given his timid self it was nearly impossible for Timmy to approach her. He and Xander had both already worked with Erin in the past, during the time she had stayed at the tenth family's castle when Leo had been training the vampires.

Still, despite this, Timmy had never really found a way to really get close to her.

"Honestly, it's kind of a hard thing to report on. The disputes are so frequent that even if we started to resolve them one by one, by the time we would be done, new ones would have already started." Timmy replied with a sigh.

"We have started to make regular rounds to at least curb their numbers, but we aren't exactly Vampire Knights. The members of the tenth family show us some respect for what we have done, but the other family members only regard us as henchmen as best, so they refuse to listen to us." Xander explained their situation.

It didn't take long for Erin to see an example of what he meant.

One of the mansions had been converted into a feeding station for the refugee vampires. A special token was being handed out to each of the vampires on a daily basis and then these tokens could be traded to get a blood pack. There was more than more than this one station set up, so this was to stop vampires from claiming more than one blood pack.

It was a solution that Timmy had to come up with since vampires were quickly disregarding the rules. They had believed that most vampires would listen to orders and do what they had been told, but they had quickly come to realise that unless the order was coming from within their own family or the King himself, those vampires would act only in their own best interest.

It was then that they saw a group of vampires walk up in the line, cutting in front of other members.

"Hey, make way! We belong to the first family, which means we should get served first! Don't you know that King Bryce came from the first family?" The one that seemed to be talking a lot was a middle aged vampire with a thin frame named Pin. Xander recognised him immediately, because he and his group had already been a troublesome bunch of vampires when he had still been in the first castle.

Pin had a real talent to gather like-minded vampires that would have his back no matter what. Not even some of the higher inner castle vampires or vampires that were on the rise wanted to mess with them. Still, Xander was no longer a vampire from the first family, he was now living in the castle and working for the tenth family.

"Have you forgotten that this is not the first family area? Right now, you're in the tenth family area, so you better follow our rules!" Xander spoke up, as he walked up to them. "All those people have been waiting their turn, so head to the back and do the same, if you want your blood pack!"

Pin took one look at Xander and scoffed.

"Do you see anyone else make a big deal out of this? You talk about fairness, but they all know their place! They also know that my place is right here! How dare someone who was kicked out of the first family think that they can just talk to anyone how they wish? If we were in the first castle I would-"

"Are you deaf AND stupid? He just reminded you that this isn't the first castle!" Timmy interrupted Pin, to back up his friend. "If the first castle area is so great, why aren't you there? Nobody forced you to come here, yet for some reason, you chose to come to us after the Dalki attacked. If you don't like it, nobody is stopping you. Feel free to bring anyone who agrees with you to the first family!"

The others soon stayed silent about this, but they still refused to move. Recognising this stalemate for what it was, Erin walked right past Xander and Timmy. She didn't place her hand on either of the weapons nor the chains that were still wrapped around her hands.

"What is this? What's with that look on your face? Are you really trying to use force on a first family member? You know what will happen if you do?" Pin threatened her, while his buddies were ready to back him up. It wasn't just them, either, there were other members in the first family standing in the line that were getting ready to fight.

Meanwhile, those from the tenth family pooling area who knew her, were praying that Erin didn't attack them.

Timmy wanted to warn Erin, to not attack because of this very reason. Right now they had members form all sorts of families, and they were very loyal to their own family. The problem was, if they intervened too much with force, it could cause an entire fight to break out in the tenth castle.

"Get your hands off me, bitch!" Pin shouted out, going for the attack. For him in the pooling area and from the first family he knew that others were unlikely to attack him. He could see the fear in the tenth family's eyes but his arm was too slow.

In mere seconds, Erin had gone past that slow punch from Pin, and placed her hand on his face, slamming it down to the ground. The next moment, the chains left her hands and wrapped around his two colleagues.

"If you don't appreciate our hospitality, then you don't deserve it. Either follow our rules or get ready for me to drag you out of this place!" Erin shouted, as she ran across the floor with the two vampire bodies scrappin along the ground. Using all her strength, she swung them out letting the chains let go at the right moment, for them to go flying off somewhere in the distance.

Their bodies were heard crashing in the ground, somewhere in the tenth area. When Erin turned around to look for any other volunteers, most of those who had wanted to act, had already moved back to their position. Only a small minority, seemed to still be debating if they should take on Erin or not, after all some of their fellow first family members not only got hurt but also disgraced. It wasn't done by a vampire knight.

Timmy and Xander seeing this, also decided to prepare themselves in case chaos was about to break out, but before anyone else moved, Erin did so first.

She noticed that Pin was still on the floor and hadn't recovered. Wrapping in chains, she swung his body towards herself, and grabbed him in the air.

"This person did not listen, and tried to attack a member of the tenth family. For those who do not listen…"

Erin then started to spin, swinging Pin's body holding him with the chains. round and round again. As his body went past those that were watching they could feel the wind, blowing their hair up. They had no choice but to stand back, for fear of what would happen if the body was to hit them.

Then letting go at the right time, as if hurling a heavy disk, Pin's body went up far higher in the air than the others, and from where they were they could see him being hurled over the large castle walls.

"Anyone else feeling unruly?" Erin asked, yet the whole place remained silent.

"Come on, let's head to the other areas."

Both Timmy and Xander could only watch in awe.

-----

At the same time, a certain individual from a distance could see the body flying through the air, eventually crashing in the market place destroying several stands that had been left behind.

'So it looks like they have decided to all hold up in their castle areas. Do they really think they're safe? It's time to go for the next one… only this time, we attack together.'

# Chapter 1329 - The Other Hero
Back in the room, Leo had just learned of the other leader's plan to apparently make Quinn the next Vampire King. To be honest he had expected a few things, but this was not one of them. Leo went to join the others at the table out of a sign of respect. He also gave a wave to Silver, something he didn't do to the others and the others didn't fail to notice that Silver also waved back.

Lee, who was sitting by his side, made note of his daughter's actions, it certainly was strange. At least he had never seen his uptight daughter act this way with anyone else before. When they finally sat down, Leo spoke his mind.

"I understand the situation you are in. I agree that the next King needs to not only be someone respected but one who has great strength. During my time here, I have learned of your rules that there is also the possibility that a leader can challenge another to win their vote."

"For this reason the person selected also needs to be strong, and after witnessing what Quinn was able to do against Cindy he would indeed be a good candidate. That being said, don't you think, all of you are getting ahead of yourselves a little?"

"Let's not even start how you basically selected someone who isn't currently present, from what I have seen, being the Vampire King is no simple task. Quinn already has a life outside of the vampire settlement, and if he were to become King, it would mean forfeiting his other life."

"While this might be the highest honour for a vampire, don't forget that he was born a human and that his responsibilities in the human world are already far more than someone his age should have to deal with. I would suggest you find another solution."

There was a serious tone when Leo spoke those words. It was at that moment that the others realised that Leo was perhaps far more loyal to Quinn than they had anticipated. He also had a point. They were so used to their own vampire lifestyle that the possibility of someone not wishing to become the King had never even crossed their minds.

Even then, there would be those that would try and encourage others to take the position it was an honour, but Leo had only cared about Quinn and his well being. After all, this was the person who had agreed to stay behind in the Vampire World for Quinn's sake.

"I think you are right, we did jump the gun a little." Sunny was the first to speak up after being chided, trying to make sure the tone was reset. Everyone in this room was meant to be an ally. "Of course, when making plans it is important to have more than one so we can adapt to the situation. Right now, Quinn is not even allowed back due to King Bryce's order."

"Still, I suggest we at least pitch the idea to Quinn, though I believe that he might be more interested in the proposition than you might think."

"Let's move onto the next subject." Jin interrupted to avoid a constant back and forth. "At the moment, we still lack any concrete evidence we can present. We only have Kazz' word that he is doing something. There is a reason why she hasn't been invited and that's because if she still hasn't shared anything with us, she's unlikely to give us further details or help us obtain the proof we need."

"What we need to do is find out two things. Why is Arthur going against the other members, and what he is doing with the missing members? Right now, the other castles are in chaos, and as leaders there are those who are more cautious to our movements, but the same can't be said for you guys".

"Silver, Leo, since the King is unaware that you have returned, you're free to investigate. They don't follow the knights as closely as us. You will be able to move more freely. We need to find out what is going on and our best chance of that is by heading to one of the families that is close to Bryce."

Hearing this, they waited for Leo to have an answer. It was clear that Silver had already accepted this task. On top of that Leo's had already proven his ability by not getting caught by others, and there was a chance that they might have to use force.

"Due to the severity of the situation I'm ready to help, but it must not affect the tenth family. I will need a disguise, so no one will be able to recognize me." Leo stated his demands.

With that done, Leo and Silver went off to prepare a plan, while the other leaders headed back to their castle. They needed to try and find out which family would be the most likely to have the information they required.

The new leaders, although they might be on Bryce's side, were unlikely to know anything.

Jil was no longer in charge of her castle, and was always kept by Bryce's side.

"If we're looking at those closest, then it can only be those two, the Royal Knights. Due to them being part of the other families they often go back. Usually, they do so every three days. So we will have to wait, or we could try to see if the new leaders know anything first, and if not move onto them from there."

"If we get caught, this could be a tough battle, are you sure you're ready for this? "Silver asked.

Leo nodded but he had one question he wanted to ask.

"I believe there is one more person that will be suitable for this task, so I would like to bring her along with me."

"As long as they are strong enough to fend for themselves and are at our level then I do not have any problems." Silver replied.

"You won't have to worry about that." Leo replied with a smile, but Silver was left wondering who this other person was that he wanted to bring.

In the end, Silver decided that the best choice was to start with Prima Killton, the new Royal Knight. This was because they could easily move from the thirteenth castle, to the twelfth castle. If they needed a quick escape or something serious happened they could get some help at least.

However, they also chose to wait a few days, so they could confront Prima himself, rather than the new leader Kim.

While they waited, Erin had continued to deal with disputes and with each passing day, the number of them had lessened. She then later was informed of a message delivered by Leo, that he would call her when needed.

Finally the day arrived.

Led by Muka, Leo, Erin and Silver traveled underneath the tunnels to the thirteenth castle. Here they had been given certain clothes and disguises to use.

It wasn't anything fancy but it didn't need to be. They wore black masks that had slits where their eyes and faces were, not that Leo needed this where his eyes were, but they thought it was best that they were all disguised in the same manner.

After changing into their new set of clothes, the three traveled to the bottom floor of the tunnels, planning now to head into the twelfth castle. Muka, who was in charge of the combination for all the locks under the tunnels in the first place, would be ready by the twelfth castle to unlock them.

Alas, while they were travelling through the tunnels, on the day they were planning to infiltrate the twelfth castle, something unexpected had occurred.

A loud bang was heard from above, so loud and strong that dirt was falling from the ceiling of the deep tunnels they were in.

"What is happening?" Silver asked.

The two of them, using their abilities, could see what was above ground. That the settlement was once again being invaded by the Dalki.

——

Above ground, Dalki had landed in the pooling area. It was at the centre of the settlement. Usually it would be filled with vampires and more roaming the streets, but instead it was deadly quiet. Vampires still lived in their homes here, as not every family had chosen to let in all those from the pooling area. So they had no choice but to remain in their homes.

One of the families in the area peeked through their window, only to see the invading Dalki that had landed. The most prominent one was a particularly large individual with four spikes on its back.

'Four spikes, but in the last attack, the strongest one that was beating everyone only had three spikes! Does that mean this one is stronger?' The worried mother thought, as she went over to her young children holding them tightly.

'Please, anyone, come and save us!'

Last time the castles had been slow to act and send out troops, all of those still in the pooling area believed that their lives were lost, until…

Those watching from their houses noticed that all the Dalki were looking in a certain direction.

Turning their heads, they wondered what they were observing, only to see their hope. Tears filled their eyes as they could see that their own King in the red blood armour had come down personally to save them.

"This threat will be dealt with quickly!" Bryce announced. "By my own hands."

*****

# Chapter 1330 - The List
It certainly was a strange sight to behold. Neither the Royal Knights nor a single Royal Guard was by the King's side. For him to appear on his own and in the pooling area of all the places to be and to protect, it surely was a historic moment.

Still, for the vampires whose standing had been on the bottom of the barrel, his being there had instantly won over their trust and respect, especially since they had believed their lives to be over. The fifty or so Dalki that had attacked the first time had returned, only this time they had brought along a four spike.

"Bring out the one I want!" King Bryce demanded as he pulled his sword out of his cane and threw it into the air. It looked like it was levitating in place. However, if one was to look at it closer, they would see that the sword had been laced with blood, allowing him to use his Absolute Blood Control to keep it there. What's more, blood started to gather around the sword itself, increasing its size by three times.

The four spiked Dalki charged forward at a great speed, yet the Vampire King remained calm, and at the right moment he hurled his weapon at him. With his blood control he was able to make the blood sword move at a speed that was too great for the Dalki to react. Whatever defences the Dalki had proved to be useless against his attack, bisecting the creature from head to toes. The blood sword only stopped once it struck the ground.

Lifting his hands up once again, as if he was pulling two things apart, Bryce made his next move. The blood covering the sword immediately broke apart, creating waves of blood that crashed into the Dalki around it, injuring them all. Some of the weaker ones fell to the ground, dead.

"These creatures are nothing but beasts! They're hardly stronger than humans, so there is nothing to fear!" Bryce announced loudly.

Hearing his words, some of those that had been hiding in their homes started to come out on the streets and began to attack the Dalki together.

"If the King is willing to fight, we must not be afraid and fight alongside him!" They shouted.

The battle between those in the pooling area and the Dalki began in earnest. Despite his claims, the vampires weren't faring any better than they had done the last time, but every once in a while, when he saw them struggle, King Bryce would help them out with his skills, reigniting their will to continue fighting.

'Yes…the more blood gets spilt, the more effective the Absolute Blood Control becomes. Fortunately, even the blood of those lesser beings has a use. Arthur… I know you're here, but suit yourself. The longer you wait to show yourself, the stronger you allow me to become.' Bryce thought confidently.

It was at that moment that something strange appeared over the skies.

"On a planet that is in complete darkness for eternity, my shadows are able to thrive. You might get stronger based on the amount of blood, but there is no limit to the shadows I can use."

A dark shadow stretched over all the castles in the Vampire World, from the King's castle over the tenth's castle and even including the fourteenth's castle. What light they had allowed to be reflected from the moon was now gone. Only the lights from the beast crystals in the street remained.

"This is not that brat's doing, there is only one person that has this much power." Bryce uttered to himself, as he started to gather blood from the injured vampires in the pooling area.

The next second, more Dalki fell from the shadow above in the clouds, but they weren't alone. On their back there were human figures who wore black masks over their faces. The problem was that those falling from the sky weren't just headed for the pooling area, they were landing all throughout the settlement.

All of the vampire leaders had come out from their castles to witness the strange occurrence, and even they couldn't believe their eyes.

"An attack from the sky!" Lee recognised from his balcony. Looking down, he saw all his people who had considered themselves safe inside the wall, stare up and do nothing.

"Everyone, prepare yourselves for battle!" Lee shouted.

He prepared his red string, throwing it out towards two of the Dalki, then standing on the balcony Lee pushed off, leaping in the air, and pulling himself forward. The string wasn't able to be retracted like a certain spider, but he knew the Dalki would try to resist being pulled down, so it allowed him to close the distance.

Instantly, he saw one of the masked men use their red aura sending out a blood swipe. For Lee this was simple to deal with, he had hardened his own hand with blood, and was able to smash through it, landing on the Dalki's back before they had landed. The three kept falling, making it hard for them to see what was happening, and soon all of the Dalki with the Masked had come crashing down into each of the castles and their inner areas.

When the debris and dirt disappeared they could see that Lee had finished off the Masked, its head having been sliced off and the two spiked Dalki on the ground had a clear wound through its chest.

The others would have been amazed at the work of their leader, who seemed to continue getting stronger unlike the other leaders, but the whole area had fallen into chaos.

It was true, the thirteenth leader Lee had fortified his training. After nearly losing his son, and fighting against the first leader, he had acknowledged that the peaceful days of the vampire settlement would come to an end eventually, so he needed to grow stronger.

But could the same be said for the other castles?

"Everyone!" Lee shouted loudly so all his vampires in the area could hear. "Now is not the time to worry about the others finding out about our secret. I know some of you are worried what the King will do to us once they find out what will happen to our family, but I want you all to fight with your full strength. Activate your Inner Blood weapons!"

Thanks to a certain special vampire that was no longer in the thirteenth family, they might just pull through this battle better than any of the other families had expected.

———

Over in the tenth castle, Paul too was worried about what was happening. He had been prepared for another Dalki attack, though he hadn't accounted for them to be accompanied by the Masked.

Xander, and Timmy were in the inner castle area, while Ashley was stationed at the gates.

The gates were more fortified compared to the rest of the camp and Paul imagined this would be the same for the other castle, since none had assumed that an attack would happen from above.

What Paul didn't expect though, and it seemed like neither did the enemy, was the special towers that Quinn had implemented. There were two towers each stationed at the three entrances and also two towers right in front of the castle gate.

As soon as the Dalki got within a certain area falling from the sky, the towers immediately started to fire off. Due to them being airborne it was nearly impossible for them to move out of the way. The Masked that were on top of the Dalki, started to fire off their red aura skills, but there was a clear winner among the two powers. The tower shots were just too much and eventually ended up hitting the Dalki.

This time, unlike those that had entered the pooling area, there were many one spiked Dalki among those falling from the sky, and with a single hit from the towers, they fell to the ground, never to get back up again.

'Quinn, even when you aren't with us, you are still helping us.' Paul thought, while observing everything from the castle, ready to go down. However, before he did, he needed to contact the Cursed base.

He tried to use his communicator, but just like when the Dalki had attacked the other planets, their communication devices seemed to be jammed.

'If I turn on the teleporter, I can send someone through quickly, and they can inform the others about what is going on.'

As if the world was telling him not to, Several of the Dalki and Masked managed to come crashing through into the castle. Not much damage was done since even the castle itself was more fortified compared to the others but there was one worry going though Paul's mind.

"The teleporter!"

———

Bryce, who had entered the inner pooling area, saw the chaos unfold around him. With all of them under attack, he didn't know which castle to go and aid. Perhaps he should turn around and enter his own castle. However, despite Bryce's strength, the strongest Dalki in the attack, were currently in front of him, and they weren't going to let him do as he wished so easily.

One of the vampires was picked up by another four spike, and was hurled directly towards Bryce. Grabbing his sword, Bryce had no hesitation slashing though the vampire that blocked his site.

"Arghh!" Bryce yelled in frustration. "Arthur!!!"

———

"Don't worry young one, I have a list to go through, and I will be saving you for last."

******

# Chapter 1331 - Low And High
Somewhere covered in dark shadows, Arthur was able to witness everything going on. The plan had been set in motion and slowly things were playing out exactly as that person had foreseen it. The Punisher was surprised at the accuracy of all of it. Had the vampires always been this predictable in their behaviour?

Even though he knew that everything going according to plan should be a good thing, somehow all of it started to feel meaningless.

'I wonder how they are doing… So far he hasn't gone back on his word, so they should all be safe…' Arthur thought to himself.

He looked towards the other castle who had come under attack. His hearing allowed him to listen to the shouts and cries of all those affected, though he tried to mostly ignore them, as he closed his eyes.

'It's a shame that the other castles had to be dragged into all of this, but perhaps it's for the better. In a way, if they were forced to continue to live in this world, then it would be cruel. Take this as a type of kindness.'

——

Paul rushed through the castle, heading for the throne room where the teleporter had been placed. On his way there, he encountered a few of the Masked who had managed to crash through.

The Vampire Knight swiftly avoided the red aura attack, only to soon feel a fist from the two spiked Dalki hit him straight in the stomach. His body was lifted in the air, but Paul had made sure to hold onto the Dalki's forearm.

"Touching me is not a good idea." Paul's hands started to glow slightly green, and soon the Dalki could feel its whole body weakening. Banging his hands together, a set of claws could be seen appearing from his knuckles. It was a special mechanism of his gloves.

With them, Paul started to stab the Dalki over and over right in the chest, yet instead of growing stronger, it lost more of his strength. His blade-like claws had been laced with poison, bringing the creature also closer to death.

The Dallki dropped to the floor, and Paul soon moved over to the Masked, stabbing him right in the face, destroying the mask and killing the wearer in an instant. Still there were more down the hallway that needed to be dealt with.

"I don't have time for this!" Paul cursed.

Fortunately, he wasn't the only one in the castle. Following the noise, some of his own men came up. Those that were once part of his army and now vampires could see their commander in trouble, so they started to move towards him.

"Wait! Don't worry about me, head to the throne room and make sure it's safe!" Paul ordered.

Without hesitation, the soldiers followed his order and started to head to the teleporter.

Seeing this, the Masked and Dalki thought to turn around but before they could, a bright light started to appear from Paul. Eight large green balls of solid poison were hovering around him.

"I said, I don't have time to deal with you lot!" Paul activated his soul weapon and his deadly poison was something no one wanted to touch.

It didn't take the Vampire Knight long to deal with the intruders inside. After he was done with them, he stayed at his location to fend off any other, but more never came. Since Paul was still close to the balcony before heading off to check on the condition of the teleporter and the rest of his people, he chose to take a peek outside to observe the situation.

He could see that the gargoyles had activated and were now aiding the tenth family in this fight. Those from the pooling area were also fighting for their lives. The stronger members were dealing with the Dalki, while the weaker pooling vampires were dealing with the strange Masked.

Although the pooling vampires seemed to be weaker than those traitorous vampires behind the masks, since the vampire refugees from the other families were all there, their sheer number allowed them to overwhelm the intruders.

'All of this seems strange. Their forces are strong and the enemy clearly has information on the vampires and their families. Although we might be faring better compared to the other families, I doubt any of the vampires will have trouble dealing with such measly forces, especially if the leaders get involved. So what exactly is their plan in all of this? Why are the Dalki attacking us?'

The thing that Paul didn't know, nor anyone else in the other castles for that matter, was that the situation in each of the castles differed greatly from one another. The number of Dalki and Masked that had been sent over, wasn't random. There was a calculated amount sent over to each of the castles, each with their own purpose.

The first ones to figure this out were Leo and Erin as they traveled through the tunnels. They could see what was happening above, especially the Blind Swordsman who had more control over his ability, allowing him to see everything from a type of bird's eye view.

Here, he could tell that the forces attacking each of the castles were different. Especially at the twelfth castle where they were heading. For some reason, it had the least number of enemies compared to the rest.

'Should we take this as a good thing, or a bad thing?' Leo wondered, but regardless they continued to travel through the tunnel. They could see Muka waiting for them. He didn't say much as the fighting was still going on above and he knew there would be those looking for him.

"I have stayed here for as long as I could, but I must now leave. Use this opportunity and find out what Bryce is doing." Muka said, placing his hand on the strange lock, and turning all the different shapes until the door moved to the side, allowing them through.

The tunnels were a great way for the group to enter the castle. Following it, it led to a giant trap door, which they slid open. With everything going on, it was a given that no one was currently guarding the place. The three of them found themselves in a dark cellar. There was no light, but it didn't matter for the vampires who could see just fine.

"Due to the chaos outside, it looks like most of the guards and vampires have gone outside." Silver noted, pressing her ear up against the door leading to a room above.

"The attack doesn't seem to be as bad here, so the leader and other vampires must have decided to stay inside. Although I don't think this energy is strong enough to be from the Royal Knight, at least the leader of the twelfth castle should be here." Leo commented.

Leo was essentially asking if they still wanted to proceed with the plan. They had originally come here today, because the Royal Knight was supposed to return to his family. Every three days he would pay them a visit, but due to the attack, he appeared to have gone elsewhere, probably to protect the King.

"I think we should continue." Silver replied. "She might be a new leader, but there is a good chance that she still knows something. Arthur still had targeted the other young leader for information, so probably they know something as well."

Going through the rest of the castle, Leo had asked Erin to guide them. Even now the Vampire Knight was still training her in all aspects and he wanted her to get better at using her ability.

Silver found this interesting to say the least, and eventually, through Erin leading them, found out that the two of them shared the same ability and that the girl wasn't any worse than her mentor. They were able to avoid all the vampires clearly until they had reached the top floor, but here was the limit, as two guards stood outside.

"Let me handle this one." Silver suggested, since she had felt quite useless so far. Using her string she quickly and quietly sealed the mouths of the guards, before she strongly banged their heads together.

At that moment, both Leo and Erin burst through the doors. This was the only thing they could do. Eventually they would be found out, so they needed to blitz in the room as quickly as possible to learn everything they could. The doors were quickly opened and the two that Erin had beaten were choked inside while the double doors behind them were closed.

The new leader, Kim Prima, noticed this and immediately stood up from her seat, drawing her rapier.

"Intruders, the enemy has entered the castle!" Kim said.

The dozen or so vampires who were with her in the room went straight for the three. It was only natural for the vampire leader to mistake the three as intruders given their outer appearance.

The others were ready to fight, head on, until strange shadows dispersed from the centre of the room seemingly out of nowhere, and a figure could now be seen standing in the middle of the room.

"Arthur!" Kim called out, her hands shaking.

*****

# Chapter 1332 - The Wrong Or Right
Out of all the leaders that Leo and his group could have selected to try and interrogate, it appeared as if their luck had made them choose the very same one that Arthur had decided to go for. Seeing him appear, confirmed their thoughts that the twelfth family had been on the original Punisher's hit list.

Leo had managed to figure out something else as well. The low amount of forces in the twelfth castle… it was done on purpose.

The number was just perfect to make the intruders seem like a menace, but not to the point that the leader had to come out and deal with them. As such, Kim Prima was still in the throne room, which was exactly where Arthur had wanted her to be.

When seeing Arthur, the others had expected Kim to order an attack, to further the distance or to fight for her life but her next actions were something none of them had expected. A leader was a position that was respected and feared by all others, the only person they would ever have to bow to would be the King, yet…

Kim Prima had suddenly gotten on the floor, and repeatedly lifted her head up and down begging.

"Please, Arthur, spare me! I really didn't know what they were planning to do back then! Killton took me along without saying anything and after that I just followed orders!"

The three were frozen in place, everyone was.

Silver didn't know how to proceed with the plan. Whether they should abort and turn away. However, after hearing the words spoken from Kim's mouth she wanted to stay.

'With Arthur here, maybe we can learn why he is so going after the other families.' Silver thought, yet there was one thing worrying her. 'Are we even allowed to learn his reason or will Arthur attack us if we do? What if his revenge is just on the whole vampire settlement in the first place. There has to be a reason why he chose to switch sides instead of acting on his own.'

Out of everyone there, the first one to make their move was Arthur himself. He lifted up his hands, and the other ones that were in the room and by Kim's side, started to vanish into the shadows.

"My Shadow lock should be able to keep them in there for a long time, no matter how much they struggle." Arthur stated. Finally, he turned around and looked at the three strange people who had entered the throne room.

The Punisher had used his Shadow cloak skill to enter the room and he had seen what the three had attempted to do. This had told him that they weren't on the same side as the twelfth leader.

However, Arthur also didn't recognise the masks or outfits that the three of them were wearing either, so he had to make a decision what to do with them. For the time being, he lifted his hand.

"If you do that, we'll break out." One of the voices said. It was a female voice, but it hadn't come from Silver. Instead it was another one that sounded confident, and had her hand held on the large sword on her back.

The confidence was something Arthur wasn't expecting. Even if all three of them were leaders, they should have some fear after seeing how easily he had taken care of those around Kim. Yet they seemed completely unfazed by what he had done.

To top it all off, Arthur felt like the voice sounded familiar, although he was unable to recall who it belonged to. Rather worried about the person that was behind him, he decided to turn his attention to the three in front.

"Why…are you here?" Arthur asked, as he put his hand down.

The three looked at each other, but the best person to speak they all thought would be Silver, knowing that she stepped forward but not too far from the other two. She wasn't as confident as the others.

"We know you are going after the vampires, but it doesn't seem like you are going after all the vampires. We've come here to gather information about what happened. It's one thing for you to kill one of the leaders, but why did you put her body out for everyone to see?" Silver asked.

Arthur started to chuckle.

It seemed like his hunch was right. There were still some vampires in the settlement that were trying to find out the truth, not that changed the situation much anyway.

"I'm glad to know that not everyone is blindly following what the other says, but is it really enough?" Arthur asked. "I don't know how old you are, or if you were alive during my time of reign, but have they really made me out to be someone who would really disrespect someone's body like that?"

"I won't deny that I was the one to kill Suzan, however until her last breath she had denied to provide me with the information I sought. What would be the point of my desecrating her body after that? I was not the one that plastered her body on her castle walls like that. It is a shame, but he was right about how the King, or the others would react."

Hearing this, Silver was slightly confused. What did Arthur mean? He stated that he wasn't the one that had placed Cindy's body on her castle wall then who was and for what reason…

It was then that the reason hit her.

Who was the one who had benefited the most after that? In the first place, they were trying to make it, so all the vampires believed that Arthur was the enemy. That he was coming for them all. Arthur had helped Quinn and some of the leaders last time, and even had favour of the old King, so they needed to make sure that all the leaders were against him.

If it wasn't for Kazz confessing that her father was behind the missing people, then perhaps all of the leaders would have been fooled into believing that Bryce was doing everything for the sake of the vampires and not just to save his own backside.

"As for why I am doing this?" Arthur's body started to sink down, only to reappear directly behind Kim. He picked her up by the back of her neck and lifted her in the air.

"Why don't you tell them? Tell them why you are so frightened and why you are asking for forgiveness?" Arthur instructed her.

It was strange to see Arthur act in such a way. Silver had only seen him a few times before, but she got the expression of him being a calm man, who had been smiling most of the time. Had the smile been just a facade, or was his current behaviour due to him already deciding to go down this path?

"It-it-it was the expedition. At the time, Bryce had received permission to take a few leaders out for training! He… He had lied to the King, and had secretly brought along a few of the leaders. They all knew the real reason. All of these leaders had lost a lot during the war of the Punishers against the vampires."

"All of them had felt that the Punishers had gotten off lightly. Some of them were scared that the Punishers could grow into a force that would be even bigger than the vampire settlement, so they decided to deal with them before it could happen."

After everything had been answered, before the others could even react with the strength in his hands and fingers, Arthur snapped Kim's neck, in front of them all.

"Now that you know the reason behind my actions, I hope you won't get in my way. I have a list to get through with and I would prefer not having to add you to it. I am determined to finish myself no matter what with my own hands." Arthur said, dropping Kim's body to the floor.

"Those people died just because they knew me. They died because we were asked to help the vampires, forced to live a life punishing vampires for their crimes and when we wanted to leave we had to fight for our freedom, and even then it wasn't enough. They chased us down to get rid of us."

"I went to sleep thinking that I had finally found a happy life, but instead of helping them, I only ended up leaving them to an even curler fate. The vampire's reign is over, but before they go, I have decided that I will personally take care of their revenge before that happens."

At that moment, a loud scream could be heard behind the three, and they soon jumped out of the way, to see a certain vampire run past all of them, holding his rapier in his hand.

"Arthur!!!!" Prima shouted, as he went forward ready to do battle.

The three of them watching this, now having learned the truth, had to make a decision. Who should they side with in this fight?

Arthur, or the vampire settlement?

*****

# Chapter 1333 - The Shadow's Weakness
Prima Killton, one of King Bryce's Royal Knights, was known as the fastest vampire in the settlement and the others could see it as he had dashed across the room in almost a second from the doorway all the way to Arthur.

From the yell in his voice, it seemed he was clearly distressed due to seeing Kim on the floor. Erin, noticing how much anger was in the vampire's voice, could only guess that Kim was somehow related to Prima.

However, Silver knew what Arthur was doing was wrong. The people who he was going after had also killed innocent lives and for what reason, just because they were scared. They were even the ones that attacked first. Which was why she, and it seemed like the others were struggling to move.

The shadows around Arthur started to move, but it looked as if Prima had improved since last time she had seen him fight, as he dashed in even faster, allowing for the tip of his rapier blade to go through the shadow before it could reach his weapon to block its attack.

Still, Arthur had moved slightly, making the attack miss, and it looked like the shadow would soon catch up. Prima quickly pulled his sword out before it was able to touch the shadow and continued his thrust again and again.

It was strange watching the 'fight', since all they were seeing a shaodw slowly chasing after Prima, but each time he would move position and attack in a different place. Arthur could simply cover his body in shadows, but if he was to do that then he wouldn't have the opportunity to attack either.

'Prima's speed improved, and he hasn't even activated his ability yet.' Silver noticed. 'He also is aware of what the shadow can do, so he keeps his range, making sure his weapon stays untouched. Did Prima start training after the loss to Cindy?'

Regardless, it looked like there was a stalemate between the two sides.

"Do you think I would let you touch me?" Arthur asked. "I know what your ability is."

Prima's ability allowed him to increase his speed after each successful hit within a certain amount of time, yet so far he hadn't managed to land a single strike on the Punisher, despite how fast he was.

"Let's see you deal with this." Arthur said, lowering his shadow and now covering the whole ground with it.

Prima started to leap back, making sure not to touch any of the shadows. Instead he thrust forward hitting the air, and out from the tip of his blade he fired what looked similar to a Blood swipe, only the shape was different as it came out like an arrow. Despite it being fast, Arthur was able to move out of the way, seemingly having an easier time evading this Blood arrow than the rapier itself.

Some watching this couldn't tell the difference in speed, but such a minimal loss in speed was apparent for these high level fighters. The strongest of the vampires.

'This man is strong. They say I am the fastest vampire yet there is someone right in front of me who can match up to my speed. The title seems to only apply to the current generation. The only way to attack him is to somehow get past his shadow and hit him directly with my sword, but how?'

It was then that a red string had appeared and had wrapped around Arthur's arm. It wasn't that the Punisher hadn't seen it coming, but more that he had ignored it because he hadn't felt any enminity coming from it. Nor did he think it was something serious to worry about when comparing to Prima across the room.

"I'm sorry Arthur, I understand your pain, but I've learned certain things from the others. You might have your reasons to team up with the Dalki, but the fact remains that your side is even attacking my own family's castle right now and you're doing nothing to stop it! I have no other choice but to choose to save the vampire settlement, my home!" Silver shouted.

Silver yanked on the string attempting to at least overpower one of Arthur's arms. Unfortunately, it looked like it hardly had made any movement at all, though Prima believed that he should be at least slightly restricted by the strings.

Although he hadn't figured out who exactly these mysterious people were, he would gladly take any help facing Arthur. Seeing the strings, told him that at least one of them was from the thirteenth family, who he had believed to be on their side against the Punisher.

"I have no grudge against the thirteenth family, but I will also not let them get in my way." Arthur stated as he yanked on the string, causing Silver to stumble into the shadow. At the same time, Arthur raised one hand and made a Blood wall blocking all of the attacks that were coming towards him from Prima who had wanted to use the opportunity when his attention had been elsewhere.

Although the shadow was a skill that was slow, making it somewhat of a weakness, his blood skills were not.

'How long has it been since I last used Blood skills… or tasted human blood?" Arthur wondered. 'Well, I suppose it doesn't matter.'

Out of the shadow that was on the ground, eight figures started to appear. They had human appearances, but were completely made out of shadow. All of them were Arthur's Shadow clones.

They quickly proceeded to surround the Royal Knight. Prima thought this was an opportunity, if he attacked the clones' bodies then his ability would activate. He pierced the first one with his rapier expecting for it to go through the body, which it did, but the body didn't bleed, and instead shadows just rippled.

As soon as the rapier had touched the first body, the shadow effect had started and began to move over the weapon. The weapon had slowed down slightly. Still, the Royal Knight felt like he could still pull out the weapon with brute force.

Before he could though, another shadow hit Prima directly in the face, sending him flying back and his body flipping through the air. He quickly regained his balance landing on the floor on all fours. With a sore face he wondered what had just happened.

'What's going on? Those clones can fight and attack me, but then why isn't my ability working on them?' Prima was confused.

However, Leo could see what had happened. Through his ability he had seen that Arthur had switched positions with one of his clones, and his real body was now present in the one that attacked. So the hit that had landed was a full strength hit from Arthur himself.

Although Prima didn't know what happened, he was struggling with how exactly he could face Arthur. The floor was covered in shadow he couldn't touch. Any attacks could be blocked with the shadow, and now he even had clones helping him.

The only time Prima had gotten close to hurting Arthur was when he had help, but even then Arthur still had blood abilities on top of that.

It was at that moment that a certain individual went to strike at one of the shadow clones, and in an instant the shadow dispersed, and the clone's body had disappeared. The next person had struck with a red blade doing the same to the one next to them.

'How? How are their blades not slowing down when they touch the clones? Are they special weapons?' Prima thought.

Even Silver, who had now gotten out of the area of the shadow on the ground, was amazed by what was happening. One by one, the clones were all quickly dealt with, and Arthur had transferred his energy back to his original place at the back of the throne room.

The two masked people that had dealt with the clones started to walk forward, and it looked like their feet were soon going to enter the shadow space that was on the ground.

"Wait, if you touch that it will slow you down!" Prima yelled out a warning, thinking that maybe these others didn't know much about the Punisher's powers. It wouldn't surprise him, after all their existence had mostly been forgotten by all but ancient vampires. It wouldn't be uncommon to not know what the shadow exactly could and couldn't do.

Then, as if Prima was witnessing a miracle, when the two masked stepped on the shadow, they could see that a clear circle appeared around their feet. It was as if the shadow was unable to reach them. They could walk through it fine without the shadow touching them.

This was because both Erin and Leo were using the third stage of Qi.

"You harmed a boy that I have come to respect and like very much. You were once a man that I admired but I can not understand what could have happened for you to have put that boy through what you did!" Leo stated, holding his sword with both hands.

Erin also decided to pull out something from her back, the Demon tier beast weapon. As she held it in her hands, frost began to envelop her hand and the weapon.

"Oh, so it's the two of you." Arthur sighed, recognising the voices and the stance.

*****

# Chapter 1334 - Off The List
As soon as Arthur saw the stance the pair of masked people had taken, memories started to flash through his head. It was impossible for him to mistake them, as Arthur himself had trained the two of them in combat. He had fought them time and time again, hoping to improve their skills and also teach them what it meant to be a vampire.

"It seems you have grown even stronger since then. Never in my wildest dreams would I have imagined that I would be placed in this situation." Arthur said with a pleased smile on his face.

This time, the first one to attack was Leo. He slashed vertically four times, sending out Blood swipes with his sword. As soon as they left his blade, all the shadow from the ground that was around it, started to move away.

Seeing this, Arthur understood that his shadow wouldn't work against this attack. He ran to the right side of the room, away from his position. It was the first time during the fight that he seemed to be taking the fight seriously, but the second he did move a large tunnel of ice was seen shooting out his way.

Seeing as this attack wasn't the same, Arthur thought it would be easy to use his shadow to block it, but he could see something that the ice tunnel was abnormal as well. Although his shadow didn't spread out, like it did with Leo's attack, he could see something else happening.

All the shadow that was touching the ice, was starting to be frozen.

'My shadow is actually losing out to the ice, this is certainly a first for me!' Arthur realised, if the ice tunnel touched him, he would be done for.

The tunnel continued forward and eventually ended up hitting the back throne room wall.

'These people, who are they? What are these powers and how are they actually fighting against the Punisher!' Prima was amazed but he knew that as the original Punisher, Arthur was rumoured to be as strong as any King, so he shouldn't fall that easily.

The next second, Leo started to move to a certain spot in the shadows. It seemed strange and Prima was wondering what exactly he was doing until Leo turned his blade… and stabbed into the ground underneath him.

Surprisingly, a clang was heard and the next moment Arthur rose from the ground, with a large sword in his hand above his head. Swinging it around he soon shifted the weight from Leo's sword, yet Arthur's appearance had slightly changed.

"I didn't think I would have to use this here, but it just shows how much the two of you have grown." Arthur was now wearing his full set of red blood armour, and at the same time, he also had unchained his sword that he had kept on his back.

Erin, looking at her sword, could see the ring was on cool down, so she was unable to use the ice tunnel skill again, but there were still the other two active skills she could use.

Arthur and Leo were now battling out with their sword skills, clanging against each other. The only problem was that Arthur was able to overpower Leo, even with the use of his Qi.

Leo had hoped that by striking with the small amounts of the third stage of Qi in spots he could harm Arthur, but each time, rather than blocking the attack with his sword, Arthur was parrying them to the side, preventing the Qi shots to hit his body.

It left Leo wondering if Arthur really knew the danger of Qi to a vampire, or whether he was just following some type of instinct.

At the same time, Leo was constantly making sure that his feet remained covered in the third stage of Qi, in order to block out the shadow from reaching him, otherwise he would instantly lose. Not leaving him much choice to do other things with it.

"I don't understand!" Leo spoke, trying to strike even harder. "Someone of your skill, someone as great as you, why did you do that to him? Why did you harm the boy?! As a teacher I can understand that you might have wanted to teach him, but what you did was far too cruel!"

Hearing this, Arthur swung his blade once more, only this time he used his Blood aura. The whole time he had refrained from doing so, so the sudden force strongly pushed Leo back. The Blind Swordsman covered himself with his sword but the strength was too much, the back of his sword had cut his own chest, though not deep enough to deliver a fatal blow.

"This world is cruel, though I don't think you need me to tell you that. No, going easy on him just because of his age, especially when I knew what he would face in his future, would have been foolish. I was…" Arthur stopped there, as he felt another presence approaching.

Erin was in the air, swinging her blade and as she did, the sword started to vibrate letting out a screeching sound. It was then that Arthur noticed that his weapons started to freeze over slightly.

'The first skill of the Demon tier weapon can still be used!' Erin thought.

Disregarding it, Arthur still swung his blade towards Erin's and the two of them clashed.

'Even with my power, and the Demon tier weapon… Our strength is equal!' Erin thought, but it didn't matter, for this was part of the third movement of her swordsmanship. The suppression chains that were usefully kept on her, were now tied around both of Arthur's forearms. The Dhampir tilted her sword to the side, and soon kicked off the side of her sword, flipping backwards, then pulled on the chains, she moved her body closer to Arthurs, coming for another attack.

Arthur was able to block them, but he also didn't have the time to remove the chains, because Erin would continually pull her body forward while displaying a great feat of acrobatics in the air, each time their sword clashed.

"Are you just going to watch?!" Leo shouted at Prima. "The two of us aren't enough to take him out. We will need your strength as well!"

This action managed to knock Prima out of his daze as he had stayed at the back, witnessing the fight. However, the Royal Knight didn't know how he could help. Unlike the fighting masked duo, he had no way to avoid the shadow on the ground.

While Erin was busy dealing with Arthur, Leo started to spread his third stage of Qi pretty thin, and now the shadow that reached Prima, had disappeared.

Not knowing how long the person could keep it up for, Prima gripped his sword and charged in. Silver ran in as well, she could at least do something, and attempted to tie up Arthur's legs while he was distracted.

'I have to wait for the right time, if I do that, I can use my soul weapon skill to make his attack stop. If all of us attack at the same time, we can deal a fatal blow to him.' Leo thought.

'Would you like my help.' A voice sounded in his head. It was coming from none other than Leo's familiar.

'You are our trump card, if I manage to create an opening, use that opportunity!' Leo replied.

Leo timed it perfectly, waiting for Prima to reach Arthur, Silver had tied up his legs, and Arthur was still busy blocking the attack from Erin. Until he could see what was happening and it was then that his grand sword started to light up.

For a second, Prima seeing this hesitated to charge in.

'A blood weapon?! But how did it activate without any blood?' Prima wondered, knowing something bad was about to happen.

The next strike from Erin, the sword exploded on impact, blasting Erin away. Quickly sticking the sword in the ground, something started to glow by Prima's feet and he was left stuck where he was, trapped by a certain ability.

The strings were suddenly cut by some type of invisible force, and now that left only one person the Punisher had to deal with, Leo. Arthur swung his blade across aiming to hit him, but he still had his ace up his sleeve. His soul weapon.

Using his soul weapon, he could redirect Arthur's attack to where he wished. Using all of his MC cells, Leo did that, trying to suck Arthur's blow into a certain spot, but Arthur's hand had only moved slightly before Leo's entire pool of MC points had been exhausted…

Leo immediately fell to the ground, almost collapsing and passing out from all the energy he had used.

'When using it against the leader of the Bloodsuckers it had worked, but this person…we…can't defeat him.' Was Leo's thought at that moment.

With Leo down, the shadow returned surrounding Prima's feet, slowing his movements. Although the trap ability from the Blood sword that Arthur used was no longer in effect, it didn't matter, for there was no way for him to avoid this blow.

A diagonal slash was made, going through Prima's body like butter, and the top half of the Royal Knight had fallen to the floor.

The next second, Arthur disappeared into the shadows leaving the others, with a whisper.

"Another one off the list, but there are still more to go."

The Royal Knight had fallen, the twelfth family's leader was dead, and the other three, although not left with any serious wounds, had been defeated in body and spirit.

*****

# Chapter 1335 - Him
Just like that, as quickly as Arthur had come he had also left, only taking the lives of those that had been on his hit list. Despite Leo, Erin and Silver having teamed up with Prima, they had failed to take down the Punisher.

Silver standing up, and looking at the situation around them, the state of the room, couldn't quite believe what had happened. Leo and Erin were far stronger than she had imagined and even that hadn't been enough.

"If… even the King tried to face him, could the vampires really win?" Silver questioned.

"Of course." Erin answered, getting up from the ground. She had received a few wounds from the Blood explosion, but other than that she was hardly hurt. The Demon tier weapon had fortunately taken the brunt of the aftermath, but it still seemed to be working fine.

However, the look on the Dhampir's face revealed how frustrated she was. Silver thought that it might be because they had failed their task or that she blamed herself for being weak, but that wasn't her reason at all. No, Erin had wanted to use everything she had against Arthur, but he had disappeared before she could.

The Punisher hadn't faced the third skill of the Demon tier sword and she hadn't felt as if her movements had been any slower than Arthurs with all the additional stats the weapon had granted her, so Erin still had plenty more movements to show in both of stances.

"Think about it, the fact that someone that strong is working for the other side, don't you find that strange? Someone at his level isn't the type to just follow the orders of others, so why is he with the Dalki and not leading them?"

"The way I see it, it can only mean one of two things. Either Arthur has a weakness that they are exploiting," Erin guessed that this might be the reason after learning about who she had received the Demon tier weapon from. "Or… there's someone on the other side that even he is afraid of."

It was this thought, the words of Ruby from the village, the reason why Erin needed to get stronger, and why they needed to become someone who could defeat Arthur.

Silver, knowing there was nothing else they could do, tied up the weakened Leo, and with Erin's ability traveled back the way they came. That's when they noticed something else as well. The sounds of fighting at the castle had almost come to a complete stop.

Currently the three of them were running through the tunnels and had chosen to head to the thirteenth castle. Erin had stated that the fighting had stopped there. Before they reached though, Silver was a little worried.

"Don't worry, your father is still alive." Erin stated. "I can sense him, actually it looks like a lot of your family did well to fend off the attack."

It was good news to hear, and the three of them could rest while they planned their next course of action. They also needed to report what they had learned to Muka, but even with all that, Silver was wondering why the fighting had stopped for now.

What would happen once everyone found out about the death of a Royal Knight, and the twelfth family?

——

Bryce himself had dealt with the wave of the strong Dalki, not allowing them to move to any of the castles. It was because of him that the castle and those living in the castle areas were able to just focus on the enemy that had attacked them.

At the moment, Bryce had returned to his castle, and he had received the report. Around ten percent of the castle forces were lost. The tenth and thirteenth castle had only lost around two percent of their forces. Alas, more than half of those that had been in the pooling area had died.

However… this was due to Bryce allowing them to die, with the large force that had attacked them, Bryce had assumed it was an all out war. He had intended to use their blood for his match with Arthur… yet the Punisher never came.

A short while later, Bryce also received news that his Royal Knight and the twelfth family leader had both died.

"Damn it!" Bryce shouted as he threw a wine glass against the wall shattering it to pieces.

"It seems like he has chosen to take you all down one by one." Tempus, the Original, who was the current second family leader, was also in the King's throne room along with the surviving Royal Knight Kyle Harlu who had delivered the report.

"When we look at the entire picture, this attack appears to have been far more coordinated than we first believed. All of it appears to have been nothing more than a distraction." Harlu said. "While everyone was busy, it gave Arthur the chance to attack the twelfth family and the Royal Knight."

"He's just running away!" Bryce shouted.

"Well, it's a valid tactic, though it's not as if his side aren't suffering losses," Tempus replied. "In the end, Arthur is just doing what he has set out to do. I would be careful, I'm pretty sure he might go for you next, perhaps using the same idea as today."

Tempus knew all the leaders that had participated in their little 'expedition', yet his family hadn't been part of it. As such, it was far easier for the Original to remain calm, unlike the Royal Knight,

"There is the matter of what to do with the twelfth family who are in chaos. Not only was the twelfth leader and Royal Knight found dead but the Vampire Knights have gone missing as well." Kyle reported. "There were also signs of other abilities used. An ice tunnel of some sort. I have started to investigate, but there is no known ability among us vampires that could do anything like that."

Bryce honestly didn't care for what actually happened, he just knew that Arthur had been there and that his Royal Knight was now dead, yet he could do nothing against the one responsible for it.

"There is a simple solution. Allow me to wake up my old friend and let him take over the twelfth family for now. I'm sure they would be useful in your little fight against the Punisher. I'm sure he would be pleased to know his ability is in the hands of another."

"That's too dangerous!" Bryce shouted instantly. "He doesn't even know our ways, doesn't even know the existence of the Punisher, nor will that person be someone who follows tradition! I can beat Arthur, all I need to do is find where he is, and where he is going to attack next."

In the meantime, the settlement started to recover from the attack, and the unsettling news had already begun to spread. They were beginning to lose hope that they would be able to deal with this problem.

Thanks to the defenses that Quinn had left behind, the tenth castle had suffered minimal losses. Those that had come from the other families were surprised at how impressive everything was, they were also able to see just how strong the tenth family vampires were.

Those that used beast gear, and the students that were trained by Erin with the power of Qi, were able to fight better than even some of the inner castle family members they had seen in their own families.

It felt like they were acutely safe and could rely on the people here. However, there was one problem. Communication devices still seemed to be down in the entire vampire settlement, even though the Dalki had left, and what was worse, was that the teleporter wasn't working either.

It hadn't been destroyed but it seemed like the other side had deployed some type of jammer, and they didn't exactly have a Logan that could help them out in this situation.

Because of this, Paul was left unable to update the others on the situation, but he also knew this meant that the fight wasn't over.

"Timmy, Xander, gather the defeated Dalki. Make sure to store their blood. Use the beast flasks, if they run out then store them in the storage units." Paul ordered.

A few days went past, with nothing happening, but worry stayed on all of their minds waiting for the next attack, all of them on guard.

*****

# Chapter 1336 - Walking Snack
The pair had arrived in the Vampire World, but they didn't do so through conventional means, they had done so using the secret teleporter that they had discovered long ago, which led to a certain lab that was assumed to belong to Richard Eno.

Fex took a look around the place, it was quite different from the last time he had seen it since it was intact before but now with what had happened the whole place was a mess. Broken machines blood over certain equipment that had been dried up.

In a way they were lucky the teleporter was still intact, a few seconds later and sparks started to appear again, and the final member had come through. As he landed, he scratched the back of his head not really knowing what to do, or why he was in the situation he had been put in.

"How the hell do I keep getting dragged into all of this? Now I'm off to the home planet of those V, but nobody explains anything to me clearly." Agent 11 started to complain.

"How many times do you want to go through this? Just accept your fate, there's no way you're getting rescued, so you'll be by my side until… well I wanted to say until one of us dies, but if that happens, we probably will both croak, so realistically… until you break? Wait, that doesn't sound too nice either. Anyway, you know how good of a combo the two of us make, so let's just enjoy the time." Fex replied while throwing him a small little spray bottle.

Agent 11 looked at it and noticed that it was the same bottle that he had sprayed himself with before coming over to this place, but as usual, they didn't really explain anything to him and just sprayed him.

Quickly, Agent 11 was looking to see if there was any chance he could escape. Fighting together, he already knew string boy's strength, but he had no idea about the strength of the other girl next to him. Although she looked to be staring into space with black bags under her eyes, so he didn't think she would put up much of a fight.

'Maybe, this is my chance while the other Cursed faction members aren't around?'

"Remember to spray yourself every three hours." Fex reminded him, imitating spraying himself in three areas. "I'm serious, without that stuff you're basically a walking meal. Vampires will be able to sniff you out in seconds. Also, they're not the only things to worry about in this place. There's Wendigo's that eat human flesh and all sorts of other things like Linda."

Hearing her name, Linda lifted her head but she hadn't heard what Fex had said.

'She… eats flesh?!' Agent 11 gulped hard. 'I guess no one is normal in the Cursed faction. Maybe it's a better idea to listen and follow them for now.' Thinking this, he placed the bottle in a type of small bag that was attached around his waist. Then with the watch on his wrist, he made sure to set a timer so it would beep in 2 hours and 45 minutes. Agent 11 wasn't willing to test how accurate that 3 hour time limit was.

Before deciding which direction to go, they needed to decide as a group what to do.

"Logan gave us a layout of the cave tunnels from last time." Linda reported, opening up a hologram that allowed them a rough idea of where they currently were and what the place looked like.

The map wouldn't update as they moved, but at least they knew where they were now and could plan for the rest.

"Our current location puts us closer to the Dragon than the vampire settlement so it would make sense if we head there first. There shouldn't be any trouble there either. You're sure that the vampires don't know about this place?" Linda asked for confirmation.

She had visited the Vampire World before, but it was under very different circumstances, and last time, there was also another person here that was there to support her. She had come here to escape some of her memories with Wevil, but no matter what she did, it seemed like everything was reminding her of him.

"Yes, that's true," Fex answered. "From what we learned, the lab was something that was created by Jim when he worked on the Dalki for them. They knew about the Dragon, but this lab and the current Dragon's position are unknown to the vampire settlement.

"Maybe the vampires believed Jim took it with him, or perhaps it was Richard who decided to move it with that ability of his, making it so the lab stayed hidden from their eyes? Anyway, it should be safe. All of the Wendigos that were here last time have been defeated."

"I can't get into contact with the tenth castle at the moment. I didn't have too much hope, but it's still a shame. Oh well, we'll be here for a while, so let's just check up on what's closest."

With that said, the group decided to head through one of the large broken metal doors and following the map that Logan had made they soon entered a few tunnels.

"So, about what you said earlier?" Agent 11 asked. "You mentioned those Wendigo creatures that eat human flesh. Were they also here in the tunnels?"

"Indeed." Fex nodded, actually happy to have a conversation partner. Linda was clearly not over her deceased boyfriend yet, so it was hard to talk to her. If it was just the two of them, Fex didn't know how he would be able to face the current situation.

"You should have seen it, a whole army was practically running after us. It was crazy, but we managed to escape in the end. I don't know what happened to all of them though."

"Yeh, that was going to be my next question, if you guys killed a bunch of them, then where are their bodies? I mean they have bones and stuff right? So shouldn't their bodies still be back in the lab, or someplace?" Agent 11 asked.

Fex started a nervous laugh, but that was it, he didn't answer after that because he didn't have an answer for that.

"Well, there are creatures other than the Wendigos on the planet. The Wendigos can also evolve." Fex eventually said once the tunnel got silent again.

"That doesn't exactly make me feel better about the question I asked earlier." Agent 11 murmured, and it was because of that that he pulled out his weapon from his scabbard and was now in carefully moving forward.

He also looked back at the others, who were able to walk through the tunnel perfectly fine, while Agent 11 had to use a light crystal to allow him to see.

'Yeah it might allow me to see, but then what about the creatures? Isn't this practically the same as asking them to come over and make me into their meal?'

"I mean most of those creatures are locked up." Fex revealed. "The Wendigos were here because of the lab. Sometimes Wendigos, or sub class vampires escape into the forest but that's incredibly rare."

"And if that does happen, the vampires send out a subjugation team. I know because my family, the thirteenth family, was sent out on these missions most of the time due to our ability. As you can attest, it's perfect to capturing someone alive, making it easy enough to hand them over to the King. In turn, he would use them for his forces."

An example of what Fex was talking about, was when Paul and the others had first attacked. The vampires had sent out an army of Wendigos at the time, to help weaken the human forces before the others arrived.

Eventually, they had reached their destination. The other lab was on site and the door could be seen in front of them already opened. The others weren't sure if the door was meant to be open, especially since Logan had stated that he had been able to open it solely due to the connection to his family.

Taking a step forward though, Linda suddenly stopped and so did Fex. Agent 11 quickly tapped his light crystal, turning it off. Since he was unsure what had happened, he could just see two red eyes staring at them in the distance.

"I was afraid the moment I mentioned it that I might have jinxed us. I guess you're going to see what one of these other creatures looks like live."

*****

# Chapter 1337 - BEEP
"Don't turn off your light crystal!" Fex immediately shouted.

He did this for two reasons, one of them hoping to attract the beast to him, and the other was seeing how Agent 11 reacted.

Agent 11 had turned off the crystal because he was unable to see the beast even though others could. The light was almost too bright on him, and the beast was constantly moving as he turned.

Turning off the light, he thought he had done the right thing. Now, he could see glowing red eyes, but seeing how high up they were in the tunnel just gave him goosebumps.

"If the creature comes from this tunnel or has always lived in a dark place, there is a good chance it's-" Before Fex could finish what he was saying, the strange creature leapt up and headed straight towards Agent 11 out of all the others.

Taking the advice, he turned his light crystal back on in time and now could see the beast in the air and what its entire body looked like. It was something that Agent 11 could only imagine in his nightmares. Its outside flesh looked like a beast that had no skin or fur. As if its muscles were fully on display, even through that, he could see parts of its bones sticking out.

The creature was incredibly large, almost four times the size of a human, but what was terrifying about it was the long hair it had on its head, making it seem almost human and the multiple heads and skulls that looked to be sticking out from its body in different areas.

"What the hell is this beast!" Agent 11 said, rolling out of the way, causing it to hit the ground. He was used to being in tough combat situations, so he didn't freeze up and managed to slash it with his sword hitting its back leg.

'It looks like bringing agent 11 was good for more reasons than one. His ability with Qi helps block the regeneration even with the subclasses, but what the hell was this creature again?' Fex thought, trying to look at it, thinking back to his studying days.

As a student who wasn't the best at studying, he drew a blank at its name. This also meant he didn't exactly know the dangers of the creature, but judging by the fact it attacked them on sight, it did mean one thing. That the creature was something similar to a Wendigo, aggressive on sight.

Quickly, Fex tied up its back legs with strings pulling it to the ground, causing it to fall on its belly, and then Linda, lifting up the club type weapon, had whacked it on the top of its head. It was a strong, powerful blow, so much that it didn't move again after a single hit, and its head was spattered on the ground.

Agent 11, who had thought about escaping thinking that maybe the girl that had been brought along with them was weak, suddenly was happy that he had changed his mind.

"What the hell was that? Was that a Wendigo you were talking about or a beast?" Agent 11 asked, moving the light crystal to see if he could get a closer look. He even stabbed it with his sword a couple of times, using his Qi to make sure that it really was dead.

"No, it's not a beast," Fex replied. "I think it was something called a mouth splitter or something. It's not one of the code red subclasses, but still, something that doesn't really add up, but how did it get in here?" Fex was wondering.

Looking around, Linda eventually found a tunnel in the large room. Although this tunnel looked unnatural, as if it had been dug out, rather than once created by Eno or the vampires.

"Well, maybe we can take a small detour," Fex said, sticking his head in the thing and seeing how far it went. He was unable to see the end.

"I mean, if we go into the lab, maybe more of them will come out from here. It might be best to close it up or something."

The group decided to go in. The tunnel entrance was quite large since it was able to fit the creature that had just attacked them. However, Agent 11 was trying to walk towards the back of the group, so he could make a quick getaway, but Fex wouldn't let him. Nudging him in between the two of them while Linda led the way.

They walked for a couple of hours, finding nothing, and also found some branches of the tunnels that led to nowhere. Regardless, they did discover a few bones here and there, but the bones looked too long to belong to a human.

Some of them seemed to be from beasts and other things.

Eventually, they noticed that the tunnel led to outside. Before they even went to the very top, they had decided to tread carefully and lightly because the group could hear sounds from above. Crawling through the tunnel, they eventually crept up to the opening and could finally see where they were.

It was another facility, but not one linked to the mountains or such. They had been travelling too long for it to be close. It was however, a place that Fex had knowledge of but never learnt about its location. Seeing what was in front of them, Agent 11's whole body was shaking. For the strange creature they had seen and fought against, there were thousands of them in this very room.

It looked almost like a giant greenhouse, too large to see the end, and each of the sections looked to have different types of creatures in them. Each section was divided by different creatures with glass, and there seemed to be a system in place to feed the creatures, at least the ones that needed feeding.

"What is this place? Are they like growing creatures here?" Linda whispered and made sure so the beasts nearby wouldn't hear.

The three of them noticed that a lot of creatures weren't near the tunnel. The one section they were in was huge and looked more like a fake environment built for the creatures. They now realised what they were in was more of a hole.

"I learnt about this. It's a place for the dangerous subclasses they can kinda control. The vampires kept them for attacks, but I never knew there were this many." Fex replied.

The sheer number was frightening, to say the least. There were more creatures here than vampires, which just didn't seem right.

There weren't ever many situations where the vampires could use these creatures to help them, so in a way it made no sense to harbour this many creatures.

"Couldn't we use these to fight against the Dalki?" Linda thought.

Fex scoffed at the idea.

"I mean, sure. I guess an army of beings that attack anything on sight would be a great help. The question is, how do you get the vampires to agree to use such a thing. Most vampires don't even know about the Dalki, so I doubt Bryce, or anyone, sees them as a threat and would be the last person to help the humans.

"I experienced their strength first hand, so. I'm a bit different from the other vampires. What I want to know is what war were they planning to have keeping this many?"

"Isn't it obvious?" Agent 11 replied. "I mean, aren't vampires and humans different races? And if they don't care about the Dalki, then they have to be gathering these to fight against the humans."

Usually, Fex would have thought such a thought was ridiculous, but with the current king in charge and the number of creatures he could see, Fex was thinking along the same lines.

"Come on, let's get out of here, there is nothing we can do anyway, and it's not like the vampires would help out the humans. It looks like the hole was just made by one of our little Mouth spitters." Fex said.

The group took one peek at the creatures, as they wanted to make a note to see if they could find this place in the future. At least Linda did, and they were on their way to do what they had initially intended.

*BEEP *BEEP *BEEP

When they had entered the tunnel, a certain agent's wristwatch had been set to go off as a reminder. Only the tunnels had echoed the sound of his watch, causing it all to be heard from the Mouth spitters above.

"Run!" Fex shouted.

*****

# Chapter 1338 - He's Everywhere
Almost immediately after the sound of the watch going off was heard. Several growls came quickly after. The Mouth spitters could be seen entering the tunnel with which they had come from. The three of them were already running as fast as they could back in.

"Are you trying to get us killed?!" Fex shouted at Agent 11.

"You were the one who told me to spray myself with the bottle after every three hours! Excuse me for actually deciding to listen to you!" Agent 11 shouted and ducked down as one of the Mouth spitters leapt over the top of them and landed in front, blocking their way.

There was one thing about these creatures that they hadn't noticed since they had dealt with the first creature so fast. They were fast. Fex was a vampire with great speed, and Agent 11 was able to power his legs with Qi to allow him to run faster. However, the group needed to slow down for one person in particular, which was Linda.

Still, she was a great help to the group since whenever they would catch up, she would turn around with her monstrous strength, slamming the Mouth splitters and knocking them back a few steps. All of the creatures were so desperate to get the trio that they were tumbling over each other, and some were even stuck in the tunnel trying to get through the gaps.

"I need to borrow you!" Fex said.

Quickly, he threw out his needles with the strings and attached it to agent 11's back. Agent 11 knew what this meant and allowed this body to go limp, leaving Fex in control, but still keeping up the power of his Qi.

As Agent 11 charged in, Fex skilfully mastered his puppet to avoid the strikes of the creature in front of them, cutting up its legs and soon, rolling underneath it to stab its head from underneath.

"Linda, how are you holding up!" Fex asked.

"We need to keep moving. My strength in this form is not enough. I can't transform in this place. It's too small. If I do move, I might hit the ceiling and make this whole place cave in on us." Linda shouted back.

Hearing this had given Fex an idea. He quickly tied up Linda with his strings and pulled her underneath his arm, carrying her and did the same with Agent 11.

Right now, all he wanted to do was focus on running as fast as he could to get out of the tunnel. The sad truth was that the two of them were slowing him down in this aspect, and with his vampire strength, it was hardly any weight for him to carry, even if they did have weapons and armour on.

Fex was able to outrun the Mouth spitters, and a short while later, they returned to the area where the lab that Logan had sent them to was based.

"Linda, do what you said before, just smash this tunnel down. It shouldn't affect this area. Especially since the facility was built here, I don't think they would have made it so fragile." Fex tried to explain as fast as possible, but he wasn't making much sense, but there was another problem.

"I…I…" Linda said, her face turning red, it was clear that there was some type of issue, but their lives were on the line.

"Just smash it!" Agent 11 shouted, hearing the growls on the beast.

The next second, Linda could be seen her body changing in size, but something was wrong. As her body grew larger the armour that she was wearing, she started to take it off.

"Wait a second." Fex realised. "The armour! Did you never get another set made for your other form!"

Realising that Linda had no choice but to take off or break her armour, Fex went to cover agent 11's eyes and closed his.

"Linda, we aren't looking. Just do it!" Fex shouted.

They couldn't see anything, but they could feel the vibrations, the loud bangs, and the sound of the rocks falling. It was unsure whether the whole tunnel had collapsed, crushing the creatures inside them. Still, they were no longer making any noises, and it didn't look like they would be using the tunnel that was made any time soon.

"Hey, can you get off me!" Agent 11 complained while struggling, but Fex made sure to keep a tight hand on agent 11's eyes.

"Just keep them shut until-"

"You can open them again," Linda said.

Letting go, the two of them could see Linda, and they couldn't help but look her way. She was back in her armour and had the club attached to her back. Her face was clearly still red.

"Thank you for what you did," Linda said as she turned around and decided to head into the facility first.

"Hey, she's kinda cute when she acts like that." Agent 11 commented.

Fex scowled at Agent 11.

"She's off limits!" he said and turned back around, chasing after Linda. "Hey wait, what if there are more creatures in there? Maybe the other types created a tunnel into the facility."

Fex, moving his fingers, Agent 11 soon felt his legs moving with them as well.

"Get these strings off of me!" Agent 11 complained.

The three had entered the facility, and they were half expecting it to look destroyed like the other one they had seen, but it was kept intact. They walked through and could see countless of the glass containers all set up empty.

The dividing pathways in the lab led to the different rooms, and if Linda remembered correctly, one of them led to the dragon. She retook the lead but what she wasn't expecting was for the doors to be open.

Seeing this, Fex and Linda were getting slightly worried that maybe something had happened to the Demon tier dragon already.

However, when they entered a particular room, they could see the demon tier dragon attached with several large cables and devices all over the dragon's body. Setting their eyes on it, all of them shivered for some reason.

As for Agent 11, he had dropped to the floor.

"What, you scared you of this thing?" Fex asked.

Agent 11, couldn't explain. It was as if his body was having some type of strange reaction to seeing the Demon tier beast.

"I seem to remember that we all reacted in a similar way when we first saw the demon tier beast," Linda replied, making Fex's smug face look a little silly now.

Eventually, Agent 11 started to get used to the pressure. His Qi output was helping him. As time went on, he was able to slowly lessen the Qi to the point where he could withstand being in front of the demon tier beast.

"What do we know? We have confirmed that the Demon tier beast is still here, but aren't the Dalki after it?" Linda asked. "If we leave it here, there is a chance that they will find it. Imagine if someone was doing a routine check-up in that facility. I know the tunnel was a long one, but if they followed it, it would have led them to this place."

Fex thought about it for a while. Linda was right, but how were the Dalki expecting to find the dragon in the first place, or were they just relying on Arthur to deal with the problem. Although Fex thought it was important if they stayed where they were, at the same time, he still desperately wanted to check on his family, but the one thing he didn't think was right of him to do, was to leave Linda here all on her own.

"Let's wait until the communication channels are open again." Fex finally said. "I don't know what's going on, but I'm sure my family is doing okay. If we're this close, I should feel something if they were hurt, right?"

When Quinn was in a tough situation, all of those that he had turned could feel a small part of his pain, but for Fex, he wasn't part of the Cursed family, he belonged to the thirteenth family, and right now, he felt no such thing.

He thought it might be due to how far away he was from them, but even now, it didn't seem like they were having much trouble.

"How…how were the Dalki expecting to kill such a thing anyway? "Agent 11 asked.

"They have their ways, and there is always me." A voice said from behind.

All three of them turned around, and almost instantly, Fex's legs had turned to jelly. Linda and agent 11 were unaware of who exactly this man was, for they had never seen him before, but they had never seen Fex act like this.

Noticing the shadows on his back, Linda now understood who it was.

*****

# Chapter 1339 - Giving Up!
Seeing that HE was here, Fex didn't know what to do. Although the three of them weren't considered weak. There was no chance in his mind that the three of them could ever defeat someone as powerful as the person in front of them.

Their only option was to escape, but how would they even do that? The leader of the punishers, the controller of shadows that went far beyond what Quinn could achieve. If they tried anything, he could stop their escape in a heartbeat.

"Who the hell is this guy?!" Agent 11 asked, readying his sword. He had dealt with plenty of V on the island, so what was so different about this one.

The next second, Arthur lifted his hand, and a shadow appeared directly behind the agent. His body was sucked in, and he was gone from the room they were in, just like that.

"I could tell he was going to be a little annoying," Arthur said. "I thought it was best to get rid of him. You." Arthur pointed towards Fex, making him jump back, thinking he was going to pull the same trick.

"You're the boy that Quinn was trying to save that time."

Not really knowing how to act or what to do, Fex felt like all he could do was nod, telling the truth, but something felt a little off to Fex.

'Wait, what is Arthur even doing in a place like this? Doesn't that mean he knows where the Dragon is located? How long has he known that for, and he talked about killing it? Then why hasn't he killed the Dragon yet? Is there a reason why he can't, or hasn't?'

The group had learnt a lot about Arthur and perhaps the reasons for him going to the other side, but it was then that Fex realised something. Arthur had never turned up in the human world. He had to have been somewhere, had he been in the vampire world the whole time. If that was the case, perhaps he didn't know. He didn't know what had happened.

"Arthur…" Fex called out relatively weakly. Just saying his name was hard on Fex, but the fact that they hadn't been outright attacked meant there was a chance.

Arthur hadn't completely gone to the other side yet.

"Arthur…" Fex said again as he assured himself for a second time.

"Are you just going to keep saying his name over and over again, or are you actually going to say something," Linda whispered from the side of her mouth.

"Art…I mean, we know why you made a deal with the Dalki. We met with Ruby. She's with the Cursed faction now. Quinn is protecting her." Fex paused, waiting to see a reaction from Arthur, but it was hard to tell since he just stood there, but seeing as he was doing nothing and was listening, Fex took it as a good sign.

"We know you wanted to protect them, so you made a deal with Jim and the Dalki, but the military and Quinn managed to save them. They can't use their lives against you anymore."

Arthur stayed where he was and looked like he was deep in thought. He didn't draw his weapon, nor did he show signs of aggression and even placed his shadow away.

"You don't understand." He finally said. "I was the one that asked them for that deal. They weren't using the Dalki to threaten their lives. I was the one that had asked them to protect them. They had no reason to listen to my request, yet they did, and I was the one that offered to help them in return."

The pair couldn't believe their ears, like Quinn, they too believed that Arthur had to have gone to the other side because they were using something against him, but now they found out it wasn't true at all.

It made Fex wonder how Quinn would have reacted if he was to hear this.

"The humans will eventually all perish, and all I wanted in return was for them to live a full life. I also assume that Minny hasn't been saved?"

This was the one thing Fex was worried about. Although Arthur claimed he had asked them for protection, why was Ruby's daughter taken away? This was the real person they were using against Arthur. Clearly, by making the request for them to be protected, Jim knew that Arthur had grown to care for these people.

"I thought as much, but if what you said is true, that Ruby and the others are with the Cursed faction. Then their life will be short-lived. So it doesn't matter anymore. My wish was for her to spend the rest of her life knowing love with her mother.

"In this war, the humans have always believed that it was them against the Dalki, and the vampires have ignored them. While that happened, the Dalki were able to grow into a force that no one can stop."

"What do you mean?" Linda asked. "Is what we heard from Ruby true, that the Dalki are stronger than you?"

Arthur then nodded.

"I see my actions have pained the whole of the Cursed faction, so I should at least explain myself, and hopefully, you can pass this message onto Quinn. When I first met Jim, he had brought along with him two of the Dalki leaders.

"I was just looking around, trying to learn what happened to my people, when I saw him. He was there as if he predicted that I would be there. The Dalki I fought against were both four spikes. They were stronger than I imagined, but they still weren't something that I, nor I thought the vampires needed to worry about."

This was expected. Arthur was one of the strongest vampires, so the only ones that should have been able to give him trouble were the five spikes, and even then, Fex thought that the Punisher leader would win.

'Unless, he said Jim was there, did Jim create…'

"A six spiked Dalki, did you face the six spikes?" Fex asked, thinking he had figured it out.

"You know about them as well. I shouldn't have to go into too much detail about their power. They were there, or Jim certainly showed he had the power to change other Dalki into six spikes whenever he wished. Just witnessing this and seeing their strength was one of the reasons why I had been convinced that there was no way for the humans or the Vampires to win this war, but that wasn't the only reason. The other was due to the Dalki I had faced.

"It was a strange Dalki, one that wore the clothing of a human. Facing him, I couldn't remember the last time I had felt so…weak. Perhaps when I was human and was told to go hunting as a child, meeting a grand bear.

"Facing that particular five spikes power was completely different to the others. That is the reason why I think that humans and vampires will lose the war."

Hearing someone as great as Arthur talk this way, Fex couldn't begin to imagine just how strong this Dalki could have been to scare Arthur away. They had fought against Slicer, but even then, Arthur's power should have been greater in Fex's head, so who was this Dalki. Still, he had given up, Arthur had given up…unlike someone else he knew.

"You…" Fex gritted his teeth. "Disappoint me, Arthur. Have you really given up? If you have, then why didn't you just kill this Dragon already when you found it. Sure, you might want to hurt the vampire race or whatever, but you could have just as well done that and still have done what you wished.

"And I don't know what your loss against that Dalki was like, but I'm sure I know someone else who felt the same way, and it was because of you. When you defeated Quinn, when you completely overpowered him and left him in that state after he looked up to you as a mentor, did he just give up?

"No, he continued fighting and continued to get stronger, and one of the reasons you thought the human race would lose, you said it was because of Jim, right? Well, it looks like you didn't even know that Quin…Quinn killed Jim!" Fex shouted.

"……Jim…is dead?" Arthur replied.
