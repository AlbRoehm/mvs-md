Chapter 1520 - An Annoying God
It was a bumpy silent journey so far in the specially made travelling vehicle the group was currently in. A large reinforced vehicle that was used by top Travellers to go hunting. It was reinforced on the outside that would block most sudden attacks from beasts, but as long as they kept moving, they would be okay and mostly ignored.

On the inside, it had everything one could need. Food supplies, beds, even a kitchen area to cook in.

Travellers needed to go hunting for days on end, and with this task, in particular, none of them knew how long it was going to take.

The journey so far had been mostly silent. They were a group of strangers, and no one felt like talking, all apart from one, Rafer, who couldn't stop talking.

It was almost as if he didn't want a moment of silence to go by, so whenever no one said anything, which was a lot, he would start yapping away. There were six in total heading towards where the Demon tier beast was located or where it was hinted to be.

Nervous looks all around filled the room, apart from two who were sitting down. Erin had her arms and legs crossed, sitting opposite Bliss.

She was scowling towards the other and made sure to keep her eyebrows furrowed. It was clear she wasn't shy about hiding her disliking from the others.

"I think you're going to burn a hole through her body if you keep staring at her like that," Berg commented. "What's wrong? You've been like that ever since she was introduced to the group. Do you know her or something?"

"Not that well," Erin replied bluntly, and that was the end of Berg trying to break the ice with the only other person he knew once again. He had tried striking up a conversation with her a few times during the journey, but she had said nothing.

The ice queen still seemed like an ice queen.

The thing was, Erin was telling the truth. She really didn't know this person well, but she vividly remembered her. She was one of the few people that had turned her life upside down. In a way, ever since meeting her, that was the turning point when she started to focus on her urges.

Each time she killed a vampire, the words that the person spoke to her would come to mind, and after all that, to suddenly leave without explaining herself. Of course, Erin had a disliking for this person.

What was worse was that every time Erin gave her a look, Bliss would just smile back.

"Berg, it is now our turn," Rafer claimed, walking over to his side.

Not following what was going on, he stood up but remembered what they were meant to do and started to speak about himself.

"Hey, that's that Sunsheild kid from the big four." Connan nudged the other Traveller Brook who was next to him.

"I am from the Sunshield family, correct, and I am proud of it, but I am not proud of myself. I wasn't with the rest of the group when the Blade's came and attacked us, but I knew about them and was to keep the whole thing a secret.

"I didn't want to go into hiding, but the rest of us had to. Scared that they could still be out there. I then tried to get stronger every day, vowing to get rid of the Blade that made our family this way and then I saw the broadcast..of him getting killed.

"Now, I honestly don't know what to do, but it has led me to this place."

It was an awkward introduction, and the others didn't expect Berg to go into his back story, but it seemed like some of the comments from the others during this trip had rubbed him the wrong way.

"Okay, now Erin was it. Would you like to introduce yourself?"

Erin said nothing and just looked away. Rafer turned to the others, hoping someone else would speak, but no one did.

Since no one had volunteered or was doing so, he decided to tell everyones' skills and powers for them. He didn't know much about the others other than their name, so it was the only thing he could do. Although Erin's was completely wrong, as it looked like Rafer still believed she had some sort of speed ability.

"Okay, everyone, now that I have introduced you all to each other. I guess it's time to let someone else talk." Rafer said, who had been talking this whole time.

The next one to stand up was Bliss, who looked strange during these times with what she was wearing. She would wear long robes, which looked to have next to no armour on them. They were blue and white in colour, bright, which stood out. Then there was her weapon which was a staff.

Still, Erin of course, wouldn't let this fool her. For one time, she couldn't even move after seeing this person.

"The Demon tier beast we are about to face is strong, we are going to its location, and I have no doubt that we will beat it." After saying these words, Bliss just stopped there, smiled and sat back down.

"That's it?" Berg was now shaking even more than before. "Rafer, didn't you say she had details about the Demon tier beast or would tell us how to beat it! What is this?"

Rafer himself looked a little confused, but since he was one that didn't like confrontation much, he wanted to try and let the matter go.

"I agree. We are risking our lives here." Conan stood up. "Please tell us you have more. Otherwise, I won't support you."

"Fine," Bliss spoke again. "I can see you are all troubled, so I will tell you why the Earthborn group decided to listen to my request and why I am so confident in us beating the Demon tier beast. Because my ability is to see the future. Not just a few seconds, but accurate representations of the future.

"I already proved this fact with the leaders of the Earthborn group. So they have come to trust me."

Hearing this reminded Erin of the time the two of them met. She had said something similar to her as well.

'Honestly, this all sounds like monkey balls, and I still think she's talking cow balls right now.' Erin couldn't help but think.

"An ability to tell the future, I'm not sure I have ever heard of an ability like that. At least not like this?" Brook had his finger on his chin and was tapping away. Just like his smile, his voice was gentle as well, which didn't suit the whole look he had.

"If you really could tell the future, then you could have stopped several fights and wars by now. I don't believe it for a second." Conan crossed his arms. "Hey, why don't you tell me how I'm going to die."

"Usually, I can't tell such specific details like that, but I do have this information," Bliss replied. "But do you really wish for me to tell you that? There are many paths to the future, and perhaps me telling you your fate is the reason it is caused in the first place. Since you asked..."

It looked like Conan was somewhat regretting his actions and was about to tell her not to say anything. Now that he thought about it, knowing how he would die would be a very scary thing, but perhaps he could prevent it.

"Your death will be a cold one, a very cold one." That was all that Bliss said, and now Conan was wondering why he was even worried in the first place.

"The reason why I know we will do well on this task today in hunting the Demon tier beast, is because of her. She will be the one that we will rely on to defeat the Demon tier beast."

Looking up, Erin could see that Bliss was pointing her staff right towards her.

'Right, I really don't like this person.' Erin thought.

Chapter 1521 - Flying Balls
"Come on, do you really expect us to believe that?" Conan asked, right after Bliss had revealed the information. "This is a Demon tier beast we are talking about, and I've never seen her in my life. What rank are you even?"

Conan was referring to her Traveller rank, the different coloured tags that they would have around their neck that would prove to others the rank they had obtained.

"I don't have a Rank. I was in the military academy long before the civil war broke out." She answered honestly, and thought there was no need to prove herself to some nobody. Still, what exactly did Bliss mean by her statement?

Was this a vision that she had actually seen, or did she just want to stir trouble.

'Does she know that I have the Demon tier weapon on me? There should only be a handful of people who know… I can't imagine that information might have leaked. However, if she does know, then I could see why she would think with me there's a good chance of subduing one. … but does that really mean she can see the future?'

"Damn it." Conan sat back down, hearing that as a reply. "We are all going to die."

Although Conan might have been the only one to audibly complain, deep down, the others that had come along in this journey felt the same way. Since the start it had sounded like a suicide squad, but they had at least hoped the military might have had a secret weapon or something. As it turns out, though, they apparently chose to trust a crazy lady.

Only a few seconds later, the outside of the vehicle started to rumble, and a loud sound had come from the left side. It was clear that they had been hit by something.

"Hey bro, did you do that?" Brook asked. "Are you a jinx or something? Just when you say we're all going to die, beasts appear?"

"Hey, now's not the time to be pointing fingers! Besides, shouldn't our psychic Bliss over here seen it coming with her powers?" The Traveller refused to take the blame for this coincidence.

While the two were arguing, Rafer was on the move, heading to the control panel, and pressing a button that would open the vehicle up. The tires stopped in place, and out from the sides the vehicle anchored itself in the ground, shooting strange devices from under the vehicle itself.

After that, a small little energy blast was sent out in all directions like a bubble around the vehicle. It was a defensive measure that would allow them to get out safely and deal with whatever the problem was.

As the back opened up, the group rushed outside to see what was going on.

Bliss was the only one who walked out casually, unfazed by that had just happened.

The first thing the group noticed as they stepped onto the black, charcoal-like ground was the fact it was hot. They could feel it on their feet, even through their beast gear. It was similar to the feeling of walking on a sandy beach with bare feet, with the sun being out. They needed to move or the pain would get to them.

This was because of the type of planet they were on. The two Shelters were placed on a levelled black ground, and most of the surrounding space was the same, but the whole planet wasn't like that. There were certain parts that were filled with molten lava from the ground below.

Even now in the distance they could see mountains of lava flowing down the side of them. In the ground itself, although not on the surface, they could see part of the ground cracked with heat waves and little embers coming out as well.

Immediately, everyone started to move due to the heat that could be felt on their feet, and they could soon see what had attacked them.

"They're…they're… balls? Floating pair of balls?" Conan, said as for some reason, when lifting his crossbow, he was hesitant to shoot at it. The beast looked like two giant balls stuck together floating in the air, and he felt like if he were to hit such a thing, he would begin to feel pain in a certain area.

Soon, though, they turned towards him, and a single large eyeball could be seen, on each of the balls.

"Ahh, it's hideous!" Conan shouted and immediately shot out an arrow from his crossbow, hitting it square in the eye. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to kill the beast. The next moment, the strange tentacles that were attached around the balls started to fire out fireballs towards him in a rage.

He managed to avoid most of them with ease, but soon more attacks were coming towards him from the others. The beasts had surrounded the vehicle, and there looked to be around thirty or so of them.

Conan would roll on the ground, and fire at those closest to him. He proved that his crossbow was a mighty weapon. While he didn't manage to hit each beast in their eye, they would still get pushed back a few feet, giving him time and distance to fire at another one.

Brook had taken out the two sickles, and hopped from side to side, not allowing any of the flames to touch him. He had attempted to strike the ball from below, but the balls would just spin along with the hit, trying to minimise the damage. So instead, Brook decided to cut off the tentacles that were firing the balls of fire in the first place.

Finally, there were the other three, Berg didn't have any problems, when the flames hit his body they did next to no harm. If he timed it right, he could even hit the flames back at the beast that would even hurt them when being hit.

There was Bliss who even though stood still not a single one of the flames were hitting her. Finally, there was Erin. Who hadn't used her Demon tier blade, though she was showing off with her blood weapon.

The Dhampir pretended to struggle against one of the beasts at first, before bisecting it so fast that it had no time to react. She had expected to see blood, yet there was something else inside. Its insides were glowing, not just that, but the energy was getting larger by the second. An explosion went off.

The bang was heard and had destroyed part of the ground Erin had stood on, but when the smoke settled she looked to be fine. Using the second stage of Qi she had learned she managed to shield herself from this explosive attack, but this was certainly a strange thing.

And that's when all of them could see, since they were unable to kill the humans in front of them. The floating pair of balls started to shake violently. They then started to glow, and it looked like all twenty of them had decided to self-destruct.

"Everyone, gather around me." Bliss called out.

She had been drawing a large circle with her staff on the ground. The others listened and got inside, including Rafer who had been observing how well the others were doing. Mainly just using a beast shield to stop the flames.

When they got inside, explosion after explosion went off one after another, and no one could see a thing, but they realised that none of them felt pain. Bliss' staff was lit up, and she had created a barrier that had protected them all from the attack.

Now there were no more beasts on site, and at least the vehicle they had arrived in looked to be okay as well.

"Phew, that was a close one, I guess I should be thanking you." Conan said, as he was constantly hoping on the spot to make sure his feet didn't get too hot. Brock and Rafer were doing the same, but for the others the same couldn't be said.

Conan gave them a look as to wonder why they didn't feel the same way. Berg, he could understand.

"It's an active ability of my armour equipment, I knew what type of place we were going to after all." Bliss explained, seemingly having read his mind.

Since they were safe, Erin already started to head back to the vehicle to get a move on. In her case, the reason she was fine was due to the Demon tier weapon. Just being next to it was giving off this cooling effect on her body. It was the perfect counter to this type of environment.

When getting back on the vehicle, Rafer had made the decision that they would camp for the day. The military officer drove the vehicle to a safer area… One that was away from the heated spots of land, and was at the foot of a mountain that wasn't spewing lava.

He asked Bliss if it was okay, though she just gave him a smile and nodded. The vehicle had beds on the other end and were stacked on top of each other like a large bunk bed. Erin was sleeping on the bottom bunk and on the other side was Bliss. However, before both women went to sleep the Dhampir had decided to approach the God.

"It's clear you're not normal." Erin said. "I don't understand it, but I can tell you're special. I also have a feeling you're not actually lying, which is why I'm asking you. No, I'm begging you. Tell me, is there a way to stop the future that you saw from happening? Is there a way to stop what is happening to me?"

*****

Chapter 1522 - Come To Our Table
Before asking the question, Erin made sure that the others were busy. No one seemed to be paying them any attention, and Rafel was the first one on guard duty as he looked outside the vehicle's window while keeping an eye on the radar equipment.

The group would take turns during the night so all of them would get some type of shut-eye.

The worst thing that could happen was if a Demon tier beast suddenly attacked them in the middle of the night. Just in case, though, seeing how careful Erin was being, she stood up and walked towards the back of the vehicle to a small table where the kitchen cooking area would be.

Berg noticed this but decided to ignore it and close his eyes.

'For two people who don't like each other, they sure do talk a lot.'

By the next second, he was asleep. It was his talent to sleep within seconds no matter what time of day it was or worry he had in his mind.

"I can't help but notice that you're worried about my earlier words." Bliss started the conversation.

"I remember every single word," Erin replied as she clenched her fist. "Heed my warning, as two sides that didn't know of each other come together to defeat an enemy the other created, the whole world will learn about them.

"At that moment, something will break the trust and bond between those two, and a new chaos will destroy the other. You will become that Chaos. Those were your exact words."

Erin hadn't made a single mistake when repeating back what Bliss had once said because, since that day, she had been repeating the phrase over and over again.

"Two sides that come together to defeat an enemy the other created. It looks like this part has already come true. You must know that the vampires were the ones that created the Dalki. And now the humans and the vampires have come together.

"Since your first prediction turned out to be true, I'm now worried about the second part. You said I would be the chaos that destroys the other… it's the vampires. I have the urge to kill vampires, and that's what you meant."

She stopped there, waiting for Bliss's response. It took a moment before the latter eventually replied.

"I don't know if that's the case, Erin. The future has changed, and I do things to prevent the future. However, don't you think there is a middle section that you have skipped over to some degree?

"The Dalki have yet to fall. Perhaps you trying to change your fate will even change this part, but who knows? What I can say is this... I don't have an answer for you, but I have knowledge that might help you find your answer.

"The vampires are beings created by a god who resides on the other side. Now you might think I'm crazy saying all of this, but hear me out till the end, and then you can make up your own mind. You, yourself, were created from a vampire, yet you have the urge to kill those who created you.

"You can bypass the laws and powers that were set by those beings and gods that created you. Your existence is nothing less than a miracle, and that is why the vampires are so scared of your kind. And because of this, even the God that created vampires will be after you.

"To God, you're an existence that must be hunted down because you have the power to rise to his position or to even rise above him. You have the potential to go beyond a vampire and reach his level. If you try to fight what you are and what you have become, you will lose your life.

"But maybe you shouldn't be fighting it, perhaps to overcome it, you need to accept it. If you don't, then it also means that you will never reach that place, and you will be running for the rest of your life.

"I would suggest, even though I shouldn't, that you should strive to become a power. I want you at our table, and I assure you, you will be alright."

Bliss stood up there with nothing else to say, but it didn't seem like she was running away this time, and her words had left Erin with a lot to think about.

As time went on, Berg woke up. It was dark outside, and he was rubbing his eyes. He took a peek below him and noticed that Erin still wasn't in his bed.

'Don't tell me she is…' Berg thought, looking over in the direction where he had last seen her before she had gone to sleep. There he could still see her on the sofa, not having moved.

'I wonder if she fell asleep; oh well, not my problem.' Berg thought, closing his eyes again, and a few seconds later, loud snores buzzed from him.

Sometime later, Berg started to wake up, but it was because he could hear sound creaking from above. He imagined that it was due to another going on watch duty. Turning to his side, he decided to ignore it. As for the person above him, it was none other than Conan.

Walking on the floor, he was making his way towards Erin.

'I could feel it from before.' Conan thought as he walked towards her. 'There is a chill whenever I'm next to her. At first, I thought it was coming from her, but then I realised it was from whatever she had wrapped up.'

The huge sword usually left on Erin's back was currently on the sofa next to her, leaning against the sofa.

'A weapon that's able to sustain the user in a heat like this. It has to be of a high tier level.' He thought as his temptation had reached the better of him.

Turning over again, Berg opened his eyes, wondering if Erin was still there, and that's when he saw Conan's hand reaching out, attempting to seize the sword.

"What are you doing?!" Berg cried.

Hearing this, Conan jolted forward and grabbed onto the cloth material; simultaneously, Erin turned her head. She had fallen asleep at some point.

"AGHHHH!" Conan started to scream in shock and confusion upon noticing what was happening to him. The scream had woken up everyone in the vehicle, and when they moved to see what was happening, they saw ice that was slowly spreading up to his arm and was freezing his entire body. It took a few seconds, and when the ice encased his whole body, it shattered into hundreds of small pieces.

"I told him his death would be cold," Bliss grunted, looking at shattered ice, which was Conan a few seconds ago, "It seems your sword did not find him worthy. Your weapon is a picky one. Take pride in that."

'My weapon Did that?' Erin was still in a stupor, but what else could it have been. Without a doubt, it was the weapon's potent freezing powers.

Erin claimed that she wasn't the one who acted against Conan. Luckily due to Bliss's prophecy from before and Berg as a witness, the others didn't need much convincing about the whole thing.

It was clear that he was the cause of his own death. However, it also meant that Erin now could no longer hide things. She took off the cloth from the large blade, and now Rafer immediately recognised its shape in its sheath. It was the Demon tier weapon that Oscar had once carried, and now it was in the hands of Erin.

"I can assure you; I didn't steal this... it was given to me. You can confirm with Samantha if you want." Erin said.

"No worries here; besides, now I understand why we have a chance of beating this Demon tier beast."

With the Demon tier beast in her hand and the words from Bliss yesterday, the group was now confident to go out and hunt for another Demon tier beast.

*****

Chapter 1523 - Two Demons

The situation looked dire for the main Graylash family. From the initial large strong attack force, only a few were left alive, whereas there was still a third of the enemy side left. However, Owen did still have one trump card up his sleeve.

'The humanoid Dalki… it's strong. Nicu might be a loudmouth, but he is not a weak Vampire, yet it only has a few scratches of blood. It would be a mistake to regard these New Gen four spikes on the same level as the older ones.' Owen thought. 'I just hope Grandfather and the other groups are okay….'

Just when they were on their last legs, that was when Nate had noticed a fierce blonde beauty running from the side. Swinging her sword, a tunnel of ice came down. It froze a few of the Dalki, and with large slashes of yellow aura and strength in every swing, she had managed to kill three of the humanoid Dalki without breaking a sweat.

"Who is that?" One of the surviving vampires of the first family questioned. They could smell that Erin was somewhat similar to a vampire but didn't recognise her appearance. They also had no idea who it was from the looks. That was until her hair started to change colour, turning from a blonde into black, and her eyes began to glow.

It was a trait of a Dhampir, when next to other vampires, for their hair colour to change. Although Erin had learned how to control it, that required her concentration, and in the midst of battle, she couldn't afford to lose focus.

"Everyone, this is our only chance. Whatever second wind you have in you…we have to attack now!" Nate shouted at the top of his lungs and was ready to with his shield.

Nate knew some of the abilities that the Demon tier sword held. He also knew that there was a cooldown after using the first skill, the second one was practically useless in this situation, which was why he had decided they had to act now.

Since Erin had made such a grand entrance, the four and three spikes had turned their head towards her. This gave a chance for the vampires, Nate and Nicu, to go out on the attack. Five vampires, all wielding swords similar to Nicu, had charged in together. They were aiming to take out whatever Dalki they faced as quickly as possible.

A slash in one's stomach, Nicu then twisted the hilt of the sword and infused his blood powers, making a large hole. Before the Dalki could act, the other five of Nicu's men leaped and stabbed it with their swords, into the Dalki's arms.

Grabbing his hilt, Nicu used all his strength and blood aura to pull the sword up, slicing the Dalki's head in half from his stomach and finishing it in one spot.

Now, he could see the Humanoid Dalki that hadn't gone towards Erin, the one that had given him so much trouble from before.

"You!" Nicu pointed his sword towards him. The humanoid Dalki looked towards them and smiled, seemingly accepting the challenge to go for another round.

As he charged towards the first family leader, its legs grew in size, mainly around the thigh area. They were now larger than his torso, and his former speed seemed as if had just been warming up. However, before it could reach Nicu, a flash of lightning came down, striking directly at the top of the Dalki's head.

It hit perfectly just behind his neck, and a metal fan was seen digging deep into the Dalki, crashing it into the ground. Soon, Nicu could see Owen standing there.

"I have to deal with this…I have failed my family, allowing too many of them to die. This one is mine." Owen declared.

He held his metallic fan and pulled it apart with his bare hands, split into around twelve different metallic pieces. His fingers were still electrified and the current was passed through from one hand, going through each part of the fans to the other, making them stay in place.

Swinging his arms downward, the fan pieces split out, and hit the ground, making a circle around him and the Dalki. They started to glow blue and an electric current passed through each of them.

Now, around the Dalki was an makeshift arena spread to look like an electric fence.

"I know you can probably just storm out of this place, but you Dalki are warriors, you should have some pride, so let's just make this a fight between the two of us."

In the meantime, a little away in the massive crater. Erin could see a group of four Dalki charging towards her. She gripped onto the handle tightly as she thought back to that time.

——

The entire group were sweating and panting after having defeated such a colossal monster. Its body laid there in the background. Ice tunnels everywhere and ice all around. Rafer had been injured quite badly, yet he was still alive, and the others didn't look much better than him.

Bliss was currently the only one that wasn't out of breath. She had created a safe area for all of them, so their wounds wouldn't worsen by the surrounding heat.

"You want to know where to go next, don't you?" Bliss asked, looking at Erin. "Take the crystal, and use it to strengthen your powers. They will need you in this war."

——

Thinking back and seeing the Dalki run towards her, Erin twisted the hilt of her large sword, and something strange happened. The colour of her blade started to change slowly, going from a white and blue metallic shine, turning red.

The edges on both sides and the inner rings all started to glow red at the same time, and a strong heat was emptying from the sword.

Pointing it towards the Dalki, in front of her, one of the rings on the sword was activated, showing the first active skill was being used again. The next moment a large tunnel of fire appeared on the battlefield. It hit the Dalki straight on, and just like with the ice, anything that touched the tunnel of fire, would soon be covered in flames.

Nate, who was coming in to help, couldn't believe it. The Dalki's strong hide resisted flames, yet the power of the demon tier weapon was melting them in front of him.

'Since when..could Oscar's weapon do that?' Nate wondered.

This wasn't an active skill of Oscar's weapon. This was the power of the other Demon tier weapon that Erin had gotten her hands on. After being told what planet to go to, and what to do, Erin had taken the beast crystal.

The others wanted to complain, but they really couldn't. It was undeniable that her contribution had been paramount to obtaining the crystal. Besides, who could stop her in the first place? Searching far and wide, she had eventually found someone who could do something with the Demon tier crystal.

It wasn't a humanoid one like her current one, so she thought it would be weaker. However, the forger was inexperienced, and the best he could make out of the crystal was an attachment, for her sword. It was one that would go onto the hilt for better grip.

When she had come to pick up what she had assumed to be another weapon, or at least a piece of armor, only to see that, Erin had almost killed the forger. Fortunately for him, he had been quick enough to tell her to try it out. She had tried to figure out what effects the hilt had.

After testing, these were the results. Every single effect that the sword had, and its active skills, had been altered slightly. Instead of ice, she could use the power of flames. The power wasn't lacking, either.

Twisting the hilt of the sword again, a click would be heard, and the sword would go back to how it once was. The cooldown for the active skills on the weapon were separate as well. Allowing her to use six different active skills on her sword. Now she wielded the power of flames, and ice on her weapon.

She ran forward towards the incoming Dalki, and slashed one of its arms. A yellow aura covered the blade, and a trail of flames were left behind as she swung down, cutting the arm. She was fast, and slashed again, killing the Dalki in front of her. Soon another one was approaching, and twisting the hilt, the blade changed.

She stabbed the ground, and a trail of ice started to leave the ground and had reached the Dalki freezing its feet. It was strong enough to break free, but it had slowed it down just in time. Not only had Erin gotten strength from the skill, her Dhampir powers had grown, and she now had the stats of two Demon tier weapons she was untouchable.

Back in the fight with Owen and the humanoid Dalki, the two looked at each other, and the Graylash family leader was taunting the man, and he gathered a pure lightning bolt of power, holding it in his hand from the centre like it was some spear.

The Dalki didn't stop smiling, circling around the arena, and eventually charged forward. It was even faster than before, and rocks were chucked up from the ground itself. It readied its fist.

"With this power, I feel like I could destroy the whole planet!" The humanoid Dalki said, believing nothing could survive its punch.

"Have you tried destroying a shell, though?" Owen smiled.

The marking on his hand started to glow.

*****

Chapter 1524 - Unbreakable Shell
Since Erin could deal with whatever was coming her way and Nicu had his five bodyguards fighting alongside him, killing the Dalki relatively quickly, Nate decided to make himself useful in other ways.

He ran through the crater and, using his senses, tried to see if anyone was still alive on the battlefield. He was sure that there would be some at least. Although it seemed everyone had fallen after the fight, the Dalki didn't have time to check and make sure each one was dead.

As Nate was going through the large crater that had become a battlefield, he saw devastating aftermaths and his hopes weren't high. There were bodies everywhere, with torn limbs, and most of them were crushed by just a simple step of the Dalki.

He could even see armour that Dalki had ripped apart along with limbs.

'This fight…it wasn't a fight they could have won. The Dalki are too strong for this lot.'

Although Nate didn't want to admit something, even though the large army of around a hundred thousand couldn't do much, they were a big distraction for the Dalki, which was one of the reasons they were allowed to live.

Nate's Demon tier shield was strong, so strong that he was confident in battling with most Dalki, and even against a five spike, he had a chance as long as they didn't know what the shield did, of course. The battle becomes more unpredictable once the enemy learns of the shield's active skill.

Still, when fighting multiple, the shield wasn't the best, Nate could make up for this with his shadow powers, but against four spikes, his shadow powers were at best able to block a couple of hits.

'The shadow power appeared strong at first…but that's mainly because people have only seen Quinn use it against overwhelming strength. It just isn't that useful.'

Finally, Nate detected a heartbeat. He immediately rushed towards the pile of bodies, started to shuffle through them, and pulled bodies off one by one, eventually pulling out someone who mainly looked fine.

"What…is going on? I couldn't breathe. They were so heavy." The young man said while trying to catch a breath.

"What happened?" Nate replied. "The fight is still going on. They're too strong, but we can still do our part. Come on, help me look for other survivors... this war, as many as possible have to come back from it.'

Thinking back to what Sam had said, the Dalki had prepared nine-strong forces in their part of the solar system to counter the strong forces that the humans and vampires had in this war. As long as they had won this fight, they would have won one of the grand battles that were to take place.

However, there was still the Dalki mothership and the Dragon to go after, and on top of that, one of the forces on their side had pretty much already suffered a defeat due to One Horn.

Looking towards Owen, Nate was cheering him on inwardly.

At that moment, the humanoid Dalki charged forward with its fist clenched. Its super-speed amplified his natural strength to the max. There weren't many things that it would be unable to break if this fist hit them.

But Owen could perhaps think of one thing.

"Don't let me down," Owen muttered as the lightning bolt mark on his hand lit up. The next second, and a large shell had appeared, only a little bigger than Owen himself.

"The legendary Genbu has appeared!" The familiar shouted, looking towards Owen while its back faced the Dalki.

Not worried, the Dalki slammed whatever was in front of it with its fist. A magnifying bang was heard, and a shockwave was sent outward. The others could feel the air's vibrations from such a mighty clash.

Yet, when the Dalki looked at the shell, there wasn't a single crack on it.

"This thing is a lot stronger than those shells I have already shredded," Genbu claimed. "Is this why you needed me? To stop weak attacks like this? I was worried that you might need me to stop others like that other kid."

"No." Owen smiled. "That guy is one of a kind, and our current opponent is someone else."

Owen leapt onto Genbu's shoulders as the turtle stood upright like a human. Honestly, Owen was surprised that Genbu hadn't even moved an inch, but it meant that what he had claimed was true.

While Genbu and Owen had been together, he had asked what exactly he could do, other than having a solid shell and changing his size. The truth was, Genbu was actually a giant in size. His large figure was his true size, but his weight was still the same no matter how small he got and transformed his form down.

The familiar could use this power to its advantage. With his added strength and ability, one would need the power to move mountains to move him.

Owen held the pure lightning Bolt as he saw the Dalki's fist was still on the shell as if he was frozen in disbelief that something was able to block it. Owen aimed to kill, throwing the pure lighting bolt down towards the Dalki's head.

But the Dalki snapped out of the daze and moved his head to the side, avoiding the strike, and the lightning bolt hit nothing but the ground.

"This shell may stop my attacks, but you still can't kill-" Before the Dalki could finish its sentence, he saw the very same pure lightning bolt that Owen had thrown seconds ago in his hands.

Around it, there was green blood which was now slowly evaporating. The Dalki noticed that there was now a hole through its stomach when looking down.

The lightning bolt was able to be attracted back to Owen even after hitting the ground.

"I can't let you die so easily, and I realised I was wrong in my assessment before," Owen stated as he gathered all his lightning powers in his other hand. The lighting continued to spread up to his shoulders as it burnt his sleeves, revealing his muscular arms underneath.

With both of his hands covered in lightning, Owen shouted, "Genbu, now!"

The next second, the turtle grew in size; it was happening quickly, growing so big it was already half the size of the entire crater. It then jumped on its feet, and it looked like it was ready to crush the Dalki.

Seeing this, the Dalki was afraid that perhaps Genbu's sheer weight would kill him along with others in the crater; it was madness. Using his legs, the Dalki tried to run out of the crater, towards the fortress, as fast as he could, but just as quickly as Genbu grew, he suddenly shrank in size and headed right towards the Dalki.

"Thank you, I needed you to get away from the others," Owen smirked at the Dalki.

Genbu, now as large as a house, landed right on top of the Dalki, flattening it on the spot, and continued to shrink until he suppressed the Dalki lying just on his back legs.

Then Owen jumped off Genbu and landed in front of the Dalki. Genbu's weight must have been immense if the four spiked Dalki could not lift it off its legs even with its power; in fact, he felt as if his legs were most likely crushed.

The Dalki was punching the ground, creating deeper craters underneath it until the pure lighting bolt stabbed it right through its hand.

"Stop this," Owen shouted, stabbing the Dalki with the bolt again. He didn't do this just once, but several times, stabbing the Dalki's hand, again and again, each time creating a hole in his body. Owen wanted the Dalki to be incapable of moving his hands, and the power of Qi strengthened the lightning bolts.

"I was wrong about you…you weren't as strong as a five spike, but those that you brought with yourself were also strong," Owen said, as he finally threw one last lightning spike directly at the humanoid Dalki, finishing it off and at the same time he himself fell to his knees.

"Genbu…my vision is so blurry…I think... this might be it for… for me.." Owen said, clasping onto the floor.

Chapter 1525 - Who I Am
A search through a vast battlefield, through endless corpses, would have perhaps taken weeks, and maybe even longer with just a single person, but with Nate's vampire senses, he could hear any heartbeat among them; in other words, there wasn't the need for him to check each one individually.

Still, the stench of the blood was even getting to his nose now that he was no longer fighting. He had to make sure to hold himself back.

Originally, he had planned to make it so the survivors would help him on his search to make it easier for him to search. After all, there were bound to be a few who would be close to death or need emergency medical care.

He had already sent one of the survivors, who was in good condition, to head back to the ship, to grab some medical supplies, and return as soon as possible, but the rest of the survivors he had found were unwilling to leave his side.

They were still scared since the fight was ongoing and wanted to stay by Nate's side. He was one of the few people who survived the fight and they knew he was strong enough to take these monsters on.

Eventually, Nate managed to rescue a group of around fifteen almost unscathed people. Some of them had even been pretending to have been injured or hurt, hiding amongst the dead.

"You bastard! How could you, my friend, sacrificed himself while you, you-!" One of the men shouted and grabbed the other by the scruff of his uniform.

"Stop!" Nate shouted. "Of all times, now is definitely not the time to fight amongst ourselves."

Continuing their search, they even found a few who had a few limbs missing. Still, they did their best to do what they could and even cleared an area for the injured outside of the large crater, placing them gently on the ground and waiting for help to arrive.

Using the strength of the beast shield, Nate still had great strength along with his vampire powers to move things quickly, and once in a while, he would consume the blood of the Dalki to re energise himself.

Right now, the group of people had just placed their tenth injured but alive, soldiers down in a cleared area.

"Commander Nate." The first young man Nate had found, named Jerry, spoke. "Do you think we can really win this war…for me, right now, it seems somewhat impossible. We aren't even on their main planet or base, and there were only a hundred of them.

"I might look young...but I was also there during the first war, and I believe you were too young to take part. This fight, as to how we were so easily overpowered and could do nothing but watch helplessly as our abilities turned out ineffective against our enemy, felt a lot like the old war."

Nate understood what must have been going through his mind because he also had the same thoughts.

"I think the same way," Nate replied honestly. "However, there are times when I see people that make me think the opposite. Look at that." Nate turned back to the fighting field.

They were on the rim of the giant crater, and down below, they could see that the fight was still going on. It was Erin, who hadn't given up, and just blocked an attack with her long blade, stabbing it into the ground.

She soon pulled out her small blood blade and her chains as she continued to go through movements, pulling Dalki and smashing them into each other while slicing them with faster speed. She took out one quickly and hurried back to her large sword in the ground.

She kicked the sword handle so hard that it broke out of the ground and flipped into the air. Then grabbing it midway with both hands, she swung it with flames cutting it in half.

It was like watching a fiercely skilful and mighty warrior take out the Dalki one by one. It wasn't like Quinn who would overpower them... this fight gave a different feeling. And to the eyes of the humans and the others, what Erin was doing right now seemed achievable.

While watching the fight, they suddenly saw a large shadow being cast over the large crater. That was because Genbu had just grown in size, but the shadow quickly went away as he started to shrink.

A few minutes after watching everything, the group realised something as they looked below.

"The fighting has stopped…there are no more Dalki! We've won…we Won!" Jerry was the first to react, and soon the rest of the survivors screamed on top of their lungs and fell to their knees. It was a relief, as they felt something beyond the joy as they realised that they had managed to survive this war.

——

Back on the ground, Genbu was still out in his human-sized form, and Owen was lying there flat on the ground, not moving for a second.

"Ha…you are weak…but you are strong enough for me. Don't worry; you are not dead. If you were, then I still wouldn't be here." Genbu muttered.

With no danger around, Genbu started to disappear, and the purple bolt tattoo appeared back on Owen's hand.

Noticing that the battle had concluded, the group began to run down the crater to check on Owen and the others.

Nicu moved swiftly. Most of the vampires in the group were now dead, leaving only him with three others who were equally as hurt and bleeding with him.

"I can't believe those damn lizards were so strong, but it didn't help that everyone else died so quickly," Nicu said, still huffing and panting.

What he was even more amazed at, though, was Erin. She had come in such a short time and had taken out the majority of the twenty-five or so Dalki who were left, killing nearly twelve of them. Not only that, she had done it all on her own as well.

"Sir, do you wish for us to gather the vampires and make a report back to the settlement?" One of the vampires asked while kneeling on a knee, still in pain.

"We should perhaps gather our fallen. They have fought side by side with us. Then we will send them to the settlement for a proper burial, but this is not a loss." Nicu said as he looked around and noticed Owen was on the floor, having defeated the new Gen Dalki.

"This is a win for us…no, it is a win for the vampire and human race!" Nicu exclaimed with a smile.

Nicu had been stubborn. He had a distaste for humans, but where had that come from? It was mostly from his father's teachings and feelings that had somewhat passed onto him, but was that how he truly felt?

From the small interactions with them all, he felt that the humans weren't bad. Seeing Owen defeat an enemy that he could not, Nicu had nothing but respect for the former.

"Perhaps someday…the vampires and humans can work together."

Turning his head around away from Owen, he soon saw a flash of red blood appear in front of his eyes. It was sudden, and Nicu had no clue what was going on, but when the blood fell, he saw that all three of his men were dead and a sword covered in blood.

It was the girl from earlier, and her eyes were fierce yellow as she walked over towards him.

"A Dhampir!" Nicu shouted as he opened his mouth and bared his fangs towards the woman. He tried to get his sword but could barely move his hand, and before he could do anything, he suddenly lost his vision as his head bounced on the ground.

Nate and the others, who were a little away but close enough to witness everything, stood frozen in shock.

"ERIN!!! WHAT THE F*CK ARE YOU DOING!" Nate shouted at the top of his lungs and lifted his shield, ready to protect all those around him.

She then turned around and smiled at them all with a tear running down her face.

"I'm sorry, this is just who I am…. I have to go."

*****

Chapter 1526 - War Crime
The first leader's body fell on the surface without a head. The young Nicu hadn't been the leader for the first family for long, and he was a youngling compared to the others. In fact, other than ones whom Bryce had turned long ago, Nicu was the last child and end of the first family bloodline from Bryce.

The thing was, for the people who had witnessed this sudden turn of event, none of them knew how much of a big deal this truly was. That was because none of them were officially a part of the settlement. Nate, who was also a vampire, wasn't involved in that world.

"She killed one of the vampire leaders, who was helping us…is she going to come after us," Jerry said in a worried tone as his sword shook in his hands. Just seconds ago, he was about to praise this woman for her beautiful skills in combat and for helping them defeat the Dalki, and now he was scared by her for his life.

After Erin had spoken her words, she had a pained look on her face as she stared at Nate, and after a moment, she turned around and ran away.

"Hey...should we go after her?" One of the men asked, unsure if it was a good idea. However, even if they wanted to chase her, she was far too fast and was already too far for them to catch up.

"No...we can't defeat her anyway." Nate answered and glanced at the sliced corpses of Dalki not far away from them.

Although Nate had initially disliked Nicu for his noble attitude and his view that vampires were better than humans.

But at the end of the day, not just in vampire terms but even in human years, Nicu was just a child; thus, Nate disregarded the former's thoughts as childish.

However, a part of Nicu wasn't childish at all, and that was when fighting by their side. Not for a second did he waiver and always went head-on to face whatever was thrown at them. He had done things that other vampires and humans would have hesitated to do.

The vehicle from the main ship had returned, and for now, Nicu's body and his head were carefully placed in it, and with all of the survivors, they headed back to the ship. They would then bring the ship back and store the dead in a special place. Thankfully there were mechs on board and special equipment; thus, the few survivors could manage all this.

In the meantime, Nate stayed at Owen's side, where he had fought the Dalki; he was on the surface sleeping peacefully despite it being hard and rough. And Nate just sat there thinking about everything and resting, waiting for Owen to wake up eventually.

After some time, Owen slowly opened his eyes. He was half expecting to see clouds, but he could see the same dull ground-like substance, and not too far from him was the humanoid Dalki he had defeated.

"You're finally awake," Nate said.

"Oh…and the blockhead is still alive," Owen replied, trying to move his muscles, but he could barely move them. No matter how much he tried, it felt like his body was stuck on the ground. He was exhausted and would need some time to recover.

"Do you remember the mediation technique I showed you? It would be best to work on that and slowly try to recover your Qi. You used it all up, nearly surpassed your limits, and were going into your real-life energy. If you meditate for a while, eventually, it will speed up your recovery." Nate suggested.

Owen followed his advice, and after around fifteen minutes of meditation, he had gathered enough energy to slowly move his body and sit up in a better position.

Still, he knew that it would take a while for him to get back to fighting condition again.

"We lost a lot, didn't we," Owen said while still sitting in a cross-legged position and meditating.

"We actually lost more than you think…the vamp kid..is dead." Nate held his head in shame. Since he had survived, he now felt like he perhaps could have done something. Maybe if he even stayed and helped Nicu fight. He was sure that Erin, having at least known her somewhat, wouldn't have attacked him.

Honestly, though, Nate still had no clue what happened, why Erin had done such a thing, and if she was killing the vampires, why hadn't she killed him as well. In the end, Nate explained what happened to Owen, how Erin was the one that killed Nicu.

Perhaps it was something he should have hidden from the Graylash leader until the current situation settled down, but he was now frustrated with Erin. Having committed such a war crime, Erin wasn't an ally anymore.

"That is a crazy story." Owen finally replied. "I am just as at a loss as you are. However, although I agree she had done a bad thing, and I would not be kind to her in any way after killing someone I fought side-by-side with, I wonder if we could have survived if she hadn't interfered at the time.

"Sure, I was able to defeat the humanoid Dalki, but I collapsed shortly after, and we were truly on our last legs at the time. Still…I was starting to like that young vampire." Owen smiled and started to think back to the little playful competitions the two of them had during their time in this mission.

Eventually, the ship arrived near the crater. It landed at a short distance from the Dalki fortress. Soon, the survivors began to gather their fallen comrades and place them inside.

"I'm scared." Nate eventually said. "Based on what happened, I should have called Sam and updated him on what is going on, but now I'm scared to hear news of what has happened to the other planets. We had you, one of the previous big four, a demon tier weapon, a vampire leader, and even Erin, who had a demon tier weapon, to eventually win this fight.

"The other groups, some of them don't even have half as much power as we had, and our whole force was wiped out. What if we are the only ones to win the battle…what if... everyone is already dead?"

Of course, Owen understood Nate's feelings well, especially after looking at the devastation the new Gen Dalki had caused. At the same time, there wasn't even a five spike among them, nor was their leader Graham.

"I need to know what happened to my Grandfather." Owen eventually said. "He is strong, but as you said, even with the leaders helping him, I imagine the forces he has run into are troublesome. If he needs help…I will have to go and support him."

Sam had told them not to do this, but even Nate couldn't go against Owen when the latter's family was involved. The plan was to continue from this planet and search for the Dalki home base. Those that succeeded in taking over one of the nine Dalki planets were tasked with this job.

"I will continue to search for the Dalki base," Nate answered. "You should go see your grandfather, but before that, let's make a call."

On the receiver, Nate was trying to get through to Sam on the other end, hoping to hear an answer to everything. It rang for a while with no response, but of course, connections across different planets would take a while anyway.

Still, it made him more nervous until he had finally heard a voice.

"This is Sam. Nate, have you contacted me to make a report?" Sam asked.

Hearing his voice was a relief for Nate.

"Yeah, we are done on our end. Are you in a suitable position for me to tell you all the details, or would you like me to write a report for you to look at?"

There was a pause for a while until Sam eventually replied again.

"It's alright; you can tell me everything that has happened so far. We have landed on the Dalki planet and have discovered the new Gen Dalki. However, we have yet to engage; we were in the middle of deciding what to do as we got the reports of everyone else."

"Please." Owen suddenly interrupted, "Can you ask them if they got a report from Grim?" He asked.

Nate relayed the question over, to which Sam replied.

"Yes, I have received a report from two groups, one of them being from Grim, and the other from Sunny…I have some bad news."

*****

Chapter 1527 - Unexpected Help
Usually, Owen was a calm leader who could handle nearly any situation. He knew that it was always best to remain level-headed when making decisions and during combat, but lately, he had been losing calmness.

Right now, he could hear his heart thumping as he awaited the news from Sam. It didn't help that Sam had already stated that the news was a bad one.

"I suppose Owen is with you; I will inform you about the other Graylash group first. Three-quarters of their forces were wiped out. They had claimed they went against multiple three to four spike Dalki, and there were even a couple of ones that appeared to be more human." Sam explained.

The situation seemed to be similar to there's, if not worse. They had only fought against one humanoid Dalki. Hearing this, Owen didn't have much hope if it wasn't for what he said initially.

"Three-quarters of their forces were wiped out?" Owen repeated, now joining in on the same call as Nate.

"Yes, although a lot of lives were lost, the second Graylash group managed to achieve victory because they had some unexpected help come their way."

———

The second Graylash family was on the move. The planet was located somewhat close to the sun, and its ozone was very thin, allowing a lot of the heat to pass through, making the planet quite hot. For a large force that wasn't used to fighting in these types of conditions, they were already struggling.

When going up against the New Gen, the group faced a mammoth task that was more challenging than they could have ever thought. Thankfully though, Grim had trusted his gut somewhat. The Graylash Family's old ex-leader had a gut feeling that something terrible was about to happen, and they couldn't take on the enemy as they had done on the other planets.

He had rearranged the group into separate forces based on the abilities, rather than having small teams like they usually would support each other. Grim had a feeling that individual strength and individual groups wouldn't be able to deal with the threat, and they needed to unite their numbers and powers.

On top of this, by noticing the enemy before they reached the place, they had fared quite well against the Dalki, far better than Owen had done, who were unprepared when seeing the fortress in front of them.

Still, the strength of the Dalki was tremendous, and while Grim was busy dealing with a humanoid Dalki who looked like it had giant balloons on its shoulders, the other humanoid Dalki was wrecking the remaining force.

Hermes, who was also travelling with Grim, had tried to fight off the other Humanoid Dalki; this one had longer limbs than usual. Its arms were almost twice the size and had double elbow joints.

It allowed the Dalki to kill a mass amount of people at once. Unfortunately, facing a four spike creature with such a unique trait was the end of Hermes's life.

Old man Grim was at a loss of what to do. He knew that they would be unable to win, but if they were to retreat, it would do them no better, and they were more likely to lose their own lives.

That was until an unexpected ship was seen approaching the battle from a distance. A shiver went down Grims's spine as he noticed the ship's design.

Countless ability users dropped from the ship. Honestly, the Graylash family thought they were reinforcements from either the Cursed faction or that of the Earthborn group, but increasing their numbers wouldn't do much for them with the situation they were in.

However, all of them dropped down in the middle of the fight, and the Graylash family couldn't believe their eyes. Some of the ability users in there were somewhat able to deal with the Dalki better than they were.

The Dalki that was soon to go up against Grim for another round soon found two blond figures standing in front of it.

Both of them then pressed their hands on the ground, and an invisible force field stopped its advance.

"I never once in my whole life thought that I would be happy to see you... I hope you won't chain me up again once this is all over." Grim joked.

"We…no longer want to live like that. With him gone, we can do as we wish, and we wish to join in this fight and help defend this place." An older middle-aged man answered.

Large explosions were going off to the right of Grim, a few hundred meters away. He knew that was where the other Humanoid Dalki was there as well, and that's when he noticed a young brother and sister pair.

"It looks like nearly the whole family is here."

————

"With the arrival of the Blades, and the Chained that they had reclaimed and gathered amongst the solar systems, they were able to overwhelm the new Gen Dalki in the end. However, considering how only a few had survived, they will no longer be taking part in the war and are returning to the Graylash planets." Sam explained.

Nate and Owen couldn't quite believe it. Like them, the second group had received help from the most unexpected people they thought of during the time. However, although one could say that they were victorious so far, truthfully, it was more like a draw since the forces couldn't continue.

After Sam had finished explaining, Nate and Owen reported everything that had occurred on their end and even told details of Erin. Nate thought it would be best to warn him, just in case Erin appeared in different places after this and also thought Sam would be the best person to know somewhat what to do with the information.

"I see. Right now, I think your suggestion is best, Nate. Owen can no longer fight in his current state, and he will head back to the Graylash faction with the survivors. You take a small combat ship; they are faster for movement if you run into trouble. Search for the Main Dalki base. If you find it, inform me, and Logan will send out an energy reading.

"With how many Dalki they have placed on these patents, I doubt that they will have much left. With each group that wins their remaining battles, I plan for them to go ahead and defeat the Demon tier beast."

Nate nodded along as he got a gist of what Sam was planning, but he realised that the latter hadn't told them about the bad news yet.

"The bad news?" Nate asked.

For a second, Sam paused.

"As you know, we had created nine forces to take on the Dalki forces. However, we have already lost one of the forces due to the incident with Sach and his Earthborn group. I thought the Dalki might stay still, but instead, the Dalki used this to their advantage. They saw the gap, and there is a Dalki mothership that is heading straight for the Daisy base."

"The Daisy base.... you mean the vampire settlement!" Nate cried back.

If the enemy was as formidable as they had faced here, and with all the vampire leaders away, Nate knew how much trouble the Daisy Planet was in.

"What about one of the Cursed factions group? Can't we send them back?" Nate asked.

Sam shook his head.

"This plan…we just have to hope that the vampire settlement can hold out without their leaders. We can't get distracted. No matter what, many lives will be lost. This is the final battle, Nate. We must locate their base and destroy it before they take down ours. Once we have taken over the main Dalki forces in the beast planet solar system, we can turn around and finish them off.

"Besides, there are no Cursed faction forces we can dispatch. The Blade group has just landed on a Dalki planet, and the bad news I was talking about wasn't even the Vampire settlement under attack. I got news from Sunny… she has run into Graham."

Nate's eyes winded after hearing that name. Being one of the few that had gone up against Graham, he knew how strong the latter was. Nate believed whoever ran into him, apart from Quinn, had no chance of surviving this fight.

"Call Quinn, tell Quinn immediately; we have to tell him!" Nate cried.

"I already tried," Sam replied. "We have even sent out a force from the settlement to the planet where Quinn is at. They are unable to move. All of the beasts on that planet have locked onto something. The vampires are fighting endlessly to protect the ship while Quinn is going through something. I have no idea how long Quinn will take, but we need to try our best to win this war without him.

"All we can do is wish our allies luck. The best thing we can do for them is to continue winning our battles. We have a tough battle of our own ahead of us." Sam said, ending the call there.

Owen was now done with his part, but Nate still had his mission to complete, as he wondered what on earth was Quinn doing.

[42 percent of nest crystal has been absorbed]

*****

Chapter 1528 - Absorb The Crystal
Currently, a group of vampires was stationed on a swamp-like Planet. They took base on one of the few pieces of land that formed a small island-like structure. The vampires surrounded it to protect the ship from beasts.

The beasts had already destroyed the ship's engine, and at the moment, they didn't even have the time to repair it because nearly all of them were busy fighting the endless hordes of beasts that were coming their way.

Earl Ronsten, who was in charge of the expedition, was currently on top of the ship and staring at the scene.

'My word, what is going on this planet. I can see beasts coming from every direction. Is it because of the nest crystal that we have gathered? But it seems like his majesty is using it for something. All we have to do is keep defending. But, it feels more like a war between our small group and the countless beasts on this planet.'

It certainly did feel that way to everyone, especially those on the ground floor. The beasts weren't extremely powerful like the doppelgangers they had fought, but they still had some strength with them and numbers on their side.

On either side, protecting the north and south sides, were the two Viscounts leading two groups of vampires. Still, they had been fighting for hours and were now getting tired.

"Don't use your blood powers!" Viscount Norvic shouted as he slammed a giant tentacle-like creature on its head, causing black blood to splatter all over him and partly in his mouth. After pushing it back with a few more attacks, he resumed what he was saying.

"Using the blood powers will tire us out quicker; just carry on using your strength!"

The good news was that the other vampires were already used to this. When fighting against the doppelganger, they hadn't used their blood powers or abilities for fear that perhaps there would be more to come.

At the same time, they had done a lot of training and fighting themselves, so they knew what the enemy's weaknesses were. Although fighting against the doppelgangers was frightening and, at the same time, was incredibly frustrating, each of the vampires had improved their combat skills drastically because of it.

"I'm exhausted." Joy complained, her fists obscured in black blood. She was a fighter who mainly just punched her way out of the situation. However, it was using up more energy in this case than in any of her previous fights. Since she would just punch the beasts that came towards her rather than dodge obvious attacks.

"I have no more blood," Moe replied. "I used up what was in the flask. You will just have to hold out."

Unlike when vampires would fight against the Dalki or go against the humans, there was one thing that was different in fighting beasts: blood.

They could always reenergize themselves or restore their blood powers and abilities with blood during a fight. It was one of the scary things about vampires and one of the reasons why they didn't fear the Dalki even after learning a lot about the latter.

However, fighting beasts, they were unable to consume beast blood.

"We have reinforcements coming!" Ric shouted.

The others were finding it hard to split their attention, but they looked up to see just what he was talking about when they could. That's when they saw a ship in the sky, which was quite similar to the vampire ships.

Immediately, a group of about thirty or so vampires dropped down from the ship as reinforcements.

"They are... from the Fifth family." Viscount Nian noticed.

The fourth and fith family always had a close relationship, this was mainly due to Jim and Sunny being close to each other as leaders, and now the vampires were happy to see them more than ever.

A long black braided woman landed in front of one of the groups.

"We will take over from here; you guys rest up a bit."

With the reinforcements having arrived, Ronsten looked at the battlefield, but the number of beasts didn't seem to decrease. Still, the good news was that a mechanic had come with the group, and now, they had enough vampires to defend the place while the others could take the break they deserved.

The other large ship landed, only a few metres away from the ship Quinn and the others had arrived. They had brought supplies with them, including collections of blood which someone handed out to the others.

Of course, when contacting the vampire settlement, Ronsten had informed them of what they needed and the situation, which was why they could prepare everything beforehand.

At the moment, Ronsten had decided to enter the Fifth Family's ship, where he encountered someone, a girl who had a straight cut bang across her forehead and long hair winding on her back. She wasn't a vampire knight, but Ronsten knew her well because she was a decendent from the fifth family, Simer.

"I'm surprised to see you here." Ronsten bowed.

"It is an important task to do with the king, of course, I would be here, and on that note, I have informed my people not to attack the giant Gorilla. I am sorry, we were unaware that it was part of your group."

Ronsten couldn't help but chuckle. Honestly, he had forgotten that the Gorilla named Jesk, as they heard Quinn call him so many times, was still helping them out. However, the Gorilla tried its best to stay away from the ship.

They imagined the beast had a strong will; whatever was tempting the other beasts, the Gorilla was fighting against it to help his master.

"It was a surprise to us as well, and I honestly forgot about it, so my apologies as well."

The two of them went to sit down and continued to chat as Ronsten informed her of what was happening with Quinn and the plan. Should they leave the planet and head back to the shelter once the mechanic repairs the ship?

Quinn seemed to be unresponsive at the moment, so they were unable to ask him. Whatever the case, staying here wasn't an option. While asking, though, Ronsten noticed that Simer was often staring into space.

"What seems to be the problem?" Ronsten couldn't help but ask.

She was reluctant to tell him, but she eventually revealed after a few moments of silence.

"Before coming here, we had received a report. It was from Sunny herself; she is going up against one of the leaders of the Dalki. I know mothe... I mean, our leader is strong, but I can't help but worry. I was hoping to speak to Quinn, but it looks like it's currently not plausible."

Just then, they heard shouts from outside. The two rushed out of the ship, and they noticed that the sky above them had somewhat darkened. That was because now several winged beasts were hovering above them.

"This…will be troublesome," Ronsten frowned.

In the meantime, Quinn was inside the ship on his own. Everyone had cleared the area so as not to disturb him.

'Finally, I'm getting used to the feeling. The energy doesn't hurt my body anymore, but the energy... it's just swirling around my body. It doesn't feel like I can actually use it… this is a little worrying, but I have to keep absorbing the energy for now.

'If I do this, that pain will come back, but I need to absorb the energy faster. I have no clue how long I have been doing this, and I have no clue what is happening here. I can tell if I break concentration and the connection to the nest crystal... the energy from it will explode and crack. This is the only time I can do this.'

Absorbing more of the energy directly from the crystal, Quinn could feel a tremendous pain crawl through his body, but the process had now sped up. Rather than allowing the power to enter him, he was forcefully sucking it.

[52 percent of Nest crystal has been absorbed.]

Chapter 1529 - A Six Spike
Flames were erupting from an enormous dropship on the desert-covered barren planet. Countless crates fell from the ship and tumbled in a wide area on the surface, though the fall from the sky wasn't enough to break the strong crates.

With the switches on, the crates moved, and it opened up, a swarm of dangerous vampire subclasses began to swarm out. Their numbers had barely diminished after the battles they had been used in so far.

From high up, if one was to look at the scene, it looked like a swarm of black ants were all heading towards Graham, the Dalki wearing clothes.

Sunny wasn't nearby Graham, but she could see him off in the distance with her enhanced eyesight. There were two others with her; Rokene was one of them, and the other was the older female Nina, travelling along with her on this expedition.

During the attacks so far, the two would usually stay in their ship, but due to the attack, the two weren't exactly able to do so anymore.

"You two, head back towards the ship. There should be a couple of combat ships still in good condition, so you should hurry." Sunny instructed.

"Are you telling us to leave you?" Rokene asked. "Leader, there is only one Dalki."

Of course, due to the reports they were handed out and the fact that this Dalki was on his own, Sunny knew that this was most likely the Dalki known as Graham.

The ship had crashed east from where the Dalki was, and the swarm of beasts soon was coming his way.

Surrounding the Dalki were several different crudely made black objects. They had no remarkable craftsmanship, and they looked like sticks stuck in the ground. This material was the same by which the Dalki made their ships and fortresses, and there was a special reason why Graham kept them next to him.

Picking one of them up from the ground, he hurled it towards the horde of beasts. The Wendigos and mouthspilters were the fastest and were ahead of the other subclasses. The second the object had left Graham's hand, it almost immediately had hit the group.

The vampires heard a loud bang as it broke through an air barrier, and all looked at it in disbelief. A whole section of the vampire subclasses had been wiped out from a single spear!

"Now I understand how it was able to destroy the ship's shield…it wasn't a special object or anything like that..it was the Dalki's pure power," Roken said as his lips were trembling.

After throwing the first spear, they saw six spikes piercing through Graham's oversized shirt from his back. However, the vampires couldn't gauge much about the power and strength of the Dalki.

Having fought against them, Sunny had learned of the strength and difference between the spikes. She remembered the vampire meeting, where Sam had stated a five spiked Dalki was the highest spiked Dalki they had seen, but now, they could clearly see six spikes on Dalki's back.

"This is an Order! Both of you hurry to the ship before it's too late. Make a report to Sam about everything you have seen here!" Sunny ordered again.

Although the horde of subclasses had taken quite the blow, and a single spear attack had wiped out around five percent of their forces, they were fearless and didn't understand better as they continued towards Graham.

In the meantime, Sunny didn't waste any more time and summoned her inner blood weapon. Rokene was watching everything, still frozen and not wanting to leave Sunny. He was a direct descendent of her. Although never treated as a successor to the Fifth family, at the end of the day, the person he was standing beside was his mother.

"We have to go. She ordered us to!" Nina shouted as she pulled Rokene away.

While running towards the ship, all Rokene could think of was one person.

'Quinn…if Quinn was here…he could save her…we have to tell Quinn…Quinn….where are you!'

Roken wanted to go back, but every time he would attempt to turn his head, Nina pulled his arm, forcing him to look in front of them until they had eventually reached the ablaze ship.

It was big, but they knew where the combat ships were placed. When getting to the back, they could see that the attack had damaged most of them, but one of them appeared to be in somewhat good condition.

"Wait, there's only one ship; how will Sunny get off this planet?" Rokene asked.

"There has to be a ship that the Dalki used or worst case, we will come back here when she has defeated him. She just wants us out of the way." Nina replied, and the two soon got in the small ship that could seat around four people at most. A combat ship had no space to move around.

After testing the controls, everything looked to be working just fine, and Nina began to pull the ship, getting it out of the burning drop ship and flying outwards. They immediately called Sam to report that Graham was here, on this planet, and they were about to leave it.

However, even though she was curious to see just what was going on, she slightly turned the ship, so they could see how the fight was going so far. That's when they couldn't believe their eyes. They hadn't taken long to get to the ship, but the battlefield already looked like a graveyard with over half of the subclasses slaughtered.

It took them a few minutes to regain their composure.

On the ground, the beasts had latched on their fangs, clawing at Graham, but could do nothing. A single swing of his hand and the air itself distorted, killing several of them in an instant.

Sunny looked to be standing behind a group of the subclasses, hoping for the right moment to jump in, but it didn't look like she would get a chance there.

"Any of the Dalki that had been killed by these pathetic creatures deserved to die," Graham said as he jumped up in the air. The jump itself had killed the beasts around him. He floated in the air for a moment, and then clenching his fists, he flew back towards the ground.

Slamming his fist down, the impact crushed the area beneath him, sending out a powerful shockwave. The beasts that were close had their bodies crushed before the fist even touched the ground. The nuclear-like fist had created a kilometre-wide crater in the ground, but it didn't stop there and continued to spread, creating more shockwaves, and soon, it reached three and finally four kilometres wide. The whole area was destroyed from the power of the punch alone, and it seemed like Graham had taken out all the beasts on the ground.

Sunny, who was caught up in the strong shockwave of the attack, had somehow managed to defend herself using blood hardening, but the shockwave destroyed her weapon, and at the same time, blood dripped from the corner of her mouth due to internal injuries.

'This….this power is on the same level as Laxmus…no... it was an ordinary punch, and the Dalki himself wasn't even injured, which means…this wasn't his full strength.'

Graham looked around with a calm expression, not fatigued at all. He picked up one of the vampire subclasses' bodies near his feet. It was a mouthspitter whose body was primarily intact still from the shockwave but was clearly dead.

Opening his mouth wide, he soon started to chew down on it, crushing its bones and anything inside with his strong jaws and teeth.

"It's time for me to have a feast and get stronger. Thank you so much for bringing all of these to me."

Seeing what happened from a distance and the shockwave somewhat shaking the ship, Nina started to fly out of the area.

"What are you doing…are we going to abandon her? If we do... she will die!" Rokene cried.

Nina's eyes were also moist as tears streamed down her cheeks.

"If we stay, then we would be dead as well. At least her life will mean we get to live." She wanted to leave the planet safely.

Now Sunny's fate was in Graham's hands.

Chapter 1530 - A Power Surge For Everyone
Out of all the attacking groups, the Earthborn group was the slowest out of them all. However, they had reason to be as they were being cautious, trying to lose as few numbers as possible and doing their best to cooperate with the vampires.

They had done well taking back the planets that initially belonged to the Earthborn group and were now finally heading into the Dalki part of the solar system. Sam had instructed them to continue ahead, and Longblade, who was leading one of the groups, understood somewhat why.

This was their only chance to win this war. Based on the reports of the new Gen Dalki so far, the new enemy seemed quite powerful, and not just by a small difference. From the information gathered, it looked like the Dalki had figured out how to create a new type of Dalki, better than the current types.

On top of that, they already knew the Dalki could get stronger by evolving, and time was not on their side. If they left the Dalki alone, the latter would create more new Gen Dalki, giving them a chance to grow more powerful.

Waiting was not an option. If they stopped their attack, it would allow the Dalki to regroup. In this case, the Dalki would just wait to create more new Gen and evolve their current forces. Although the human force was large, already having lost so many, it wasn't like their own forces could suddenly increase in strength or number.

It was a formidable force they had to face, and Longblade and his group were approaching one of the Dalki planets on which they were expecting to come across the new Gen Dalki. Along with Longblade was the thirteenth leader Lee, and the second leader Katori.

The string ability from the thirteenth vampires had helped them considerably in holding the strong Dalki in place, and they had even saved many human lives when using the former as puppets during the war.

At the same time, the second family with the reversing ability meant that they could enjoy the effects of healing that were better than normal healing. It made the Earthborn group under Longblade's command just respect the two families even more, and he was hoping he could utilise all of their powers in this fight as well.

At the same time, the other Earthborn group was made up mostly of vampires and generals, and they were able to use their brute strength to defeat the Dalki. Jin, Ken Kilton, and Dillan Scutter, three vampire leaders who had abilities suited for taking on the Dalki, really showed off their powers in the fights so far.

On top of that, since most of them in the group were vampires, the Dalki's green blood gave an extra boost while fighting.

Soon, both of these Earthborn groups would be landing on the Dalki planet, ready to go into battle.

——

An hour later.

It had only been an hour since Longblade and his vast army of a hundred thousand had landed on the planet, and they were now greatly struggling against the new Dalki. The planet they were fighting had quite large grass fields and large meadows.

This meant there weren't many strategic locations for them to use in fighting. Tactics were useless, and since they were on the attack, they had to go towards the fortress on the planet in an attempt to take it out. Currently, the new Gen Dalki had already massacred a quarter of their forces.

'This is difficult..' Longblade said while assessing the situation. 'The Dalki aren't fighting us head-on. Did they get reports from the other fortresses which our forces have defeated?'

Unlike the previous battles that had been an all-out war, the Dalki here were going on the defence and holding up in the fortress. The humans practically had to raid the place. Some of the vampires from the thirteenth family successfully scaled the wall with their abilities and brought others up with them.

But just like the reports stated, the Dalki forces were far stronger than other forces they came across. They consisted of three spikes and four spikes, and even though they weren't even large in number, taking them down seemed impossible.

'There's also that humanoid-looking one...with the abnormally long tongue. I didn't even know anyone could use a tongue like that.' Just as Longblade thought of this, he saw the humanoid Dalki coiling its tongue around someone's body, and like a frog, the Dalki pulled him towards its mouth, killing it by crushing it to pieces.

"We have no choice," Lee stated, who was also watching things go on. "We have tried to find ways to infiltrate the fortress, but none are working. We will just have to create a force of our strongest and head in together to create a gap so the rest can join in as well."

Longblade wasn't quick to agree with Lee's plan. They had already lost many lives, and he didn't want to view his people as just a number. From the reports so far, even if they were to create a potent force, the enemy can still take them out.

Before making any decision, Longblade decided to call the other Earthborn group to see how they were faring. On the other side, Jin, who was leading this force, answered, and the situation he reported was similar to how things were going here.

The Dalki were staying in their fortress, and the group had yet to figure out a way to enter the fortress. And they had also just attempted what Lee had suggested with the vampire leaders, but it turned out to be an unsuccessful attempt.

In fact, one of the vampire leaders had even lost his life. The eleventh family leader Dillan Scutter. This caused them to retreat. In the retreat itself, the Dalki were able to take out half of their forces, and now they were at a loss of what to do.

"I understand how you feel, but we won't be getting reinforcements," Longblade stated. "We have no choice but to fight to the best of our ability and hope that our side comes out as the winner."

A few moments after he said that, Longblade had received a message from someone he didn't expect. It looked like the help they needed might arrive.

He called for a temporary retreat and then told the vampires to gather for the meeting.

"We plan to attack the fortress head-on, and for that, we will require your power," Longblade said. "I hate to admit it, but we can't do this without you. I, as the leader of this group, ask you this favour, and if you can get us inside, the rest of us will try our best to get rid of the Dalki."

The vampires looked at each other in confusion. So far, attack forces had been quite mixed, but now Longblade was asking the vampires to lead the charge. Where they basically asking the vampires to be their human shield.

"Sacrifice your own people, and we will get rid of the Dalki." One of them shouted.

The others soon agreed, and Lee and Katori were ready to silence them, but Longblade shook his head, knowing that this was the expected reaction.

"There is a reason why I am asking for your help." Longblade smiled and looked up, "And that's because of them."

A ship was seen approaching the area that they had made their temporary base for now, which was quite far enough to be away from the sight range of the fortress. Besides, the Dalki weren't chasing after them, so there wasn't much trouble.

When the ship landed, two figures walked out, and with them, they pushed along a large crate that was the size of a car; as for who these two people were, they were Linda and Fex.

At the same time, landing on the other Dalki beast planet, supporting Jin and the others, was another pair doing the same thing, and this pair was Samantha and Mona.

"This here will help you win the fight. Tell all the vampires to take a drink this... and we will win this war!" Samantha instructed.

Opening up the containers, the vampires could all smell it immediately. It was Dalki blood, but not just any Dalki blood; rather, it was blood from a five spike Dalki.

One Horn's death would be the turning point in the battle. Oscar's and Sach's death wouldn't be in vain.

Chapter 1531 - Stronger than the King

Two more of the Cursed faction groups were behind the others. They had entered the Dalki part of the beast solar system, armed with the information that the others had already gathered.

Based on the information so far, the groups believed that they were going into a tough battle ahead of them. However, one of these groups, led by Peter, wasn't nervous at all.

At the moment, he stood firm on his large ship as it approached the Dalki planet that was primarily made of what looked like ice but had a purplish tinge to it.

"Do you think Wight has some sort of problem?" The recently promoted vampire knight of the sixth family knight asked. His eyes were staring at Peter's back; to be specific, he was staring at what was around him.

"You should be careful with your words," Jake replied. "That man is the reason why we have had to do next to little work. Honestly, he is fearless, and his strength seems limitless. Sure he might have a strange taste, but that is down to him."

The other vampires at the table, along with Jake, had known him for a long time. Since he had been their leader for a while now, they were mostly at the rank of Earls working inside the sixth family castle. Yet, in all their time of serving someone, they had never seen their leader so… possessed by the person in front of them.

Watching Peter fight had absorbed him, and their leader had become a true fan. The thing was, it wasn't just him; many of the other Earls, the viscount, and vampires had become his fans. Peter's personality is what they imagined a vampire leader should be like.

No hesitation, great strength and dominating everything with his sheer power. As for what they were commentating on about his...special taste, it was about the Lesser Wights that he had chosen. Like a bodyguard, a headless human stood beside Peter at all times, and he too could utilise strong beast gear and had a strong body itself.

Then there was the five spike leader, Slicer, who had a tail faster and sharper than any Dalki and could even defeat four spike Dalki with ease. Lastly, there were two new additions to their group.

Peter had taken the highest tier Dalki he could find, two four spikes, yet one of them had only a single arm. Peter himself had ripped it off during the fight and had a hole through his chest from where Peter had killed him.

Then the other Dalki that Peter had resurrected had wings, making it quite unique. Not all Dalki had wings, except for those at the fifth tier, which was why it was a bit unique for this one.

Only Peter had made it even more unique, or to be accurate, his partner Leg's, who had cut off one of its wings during a fight now, making them practically useless. Because of this, each of the lesser Wights Peter had around him seemed to have a missing limb or two.

The others didn't know whether that was a coincidence or not, which led to some strange rumours being passed around between the vampires.

'Quinn, whenever you get stronger, I can feel the strength in me rising.' Peter thought, 'But...what I don't have is your martial arts skills or your blood powers. I've been improving the way I fight, improving my powers of the Wight...but what's this feeling I have right now?

'What is happening to you? And... what is happening to me.'

Peter couldn't quite explain it, but there was always a link between him and Quinn. Although it is said that Wights grew stronger with their leader, it is defined by the limits of the Wight's body.

However, Peter had continued to grow in strength along with Quinn, and he had a feeling it was due to the connection he could feel even now. Yet, for the first time, Peter could feel energy stronger than his body was slipping away.

'Is it me that's changing or…' Since his powers were growing as well, Peter thought perhaps this was a way for Wight to grow independently and not a special trait or circumstances.

...

The ship had anchored away from the enemy signatures. According to the latest information, there was a high possibility that the Dalki might not attack them. Instead, they would go on the defensive and wouldn't leave the fortress.

With how Peter had led so far, he stood in the front of everyone, along with his four lesser Wights in front, as they all marched forward. With the probability that the Dalki weren't going on the attack, they took the chances and landed the ship closer to the fortress.

While marching, they followed the strange ice, which had begun to make a peculiar shape. They entered what felt like a narrow ridge, with an enormous giant skyscraper of ice towers over them, but because they were leaning against each other, it allowed for some light to get through the gaps.

However, if they were to try and escape left or right, it would be somewhat impossible due to the ice all around them, unless they wanted to climb up the side of the walls until they went through the gaps.

Eventually, they saw their target in sight. The fortress was in the large gap of ice. Up ahead, they could see the fortress, and due to the ice surrounding it, they could only attack from one direction.

Far off in their distance, the Dalki stood on the wall, and among them, one of them smiled back at the group.

"So that's the humanoid type Dalki that they all have been talking about." Peter smiled. Although its body had the skin of a human, its arms were scaled, and its hands were slightly different because they looked a bit darker and worn out, turning a slight red.

It reminded Peter of Slicer's scales and the type which the other five spike Dalki would have. In addition to that, the new Gen Dalki had very long claws, much longer than usual.

'Hmm, I guess others would be scared, but I've seen scarier people.' Peter thought, thinking of Quinn's familiar.

"What's the plan?" Jake asked, noticing that Peter hadn't charged in headfirst like he usually would have done similar to before. "I thought perhaps I should go with the other vampires first. But we wouldn't go for an attack; instead, we will lay some traps on the walls and the outside. That way, it will leave the rest to take them on."

Jake thought he had come up with a good suggestion and was being a good support to Peter by suggesting this. He was actually thinking for the best of the whole group, rather than what was easy for the vampires or humans.

However, it looked like Jake was wrong about one thing.

"The plan?" Peter smiled back. "The plan is him!"

The next second and Peter took off on his own again. He had beast gear on him, not as good as Quinn's, but still at a high level. However, what he did have of Quinn's was the speed running across the ice; not even his lesser Wights could keep up with him.

"Do you think your fortress doors could hold me back!" Peter smirked.

Two four spike Dalki jumped down, trying to block Peter's path. Just then, he reached for two buttons with his hands, and jumping through the air, he thrust them forward rather than swinging them.

His attack was too fast and powerful for them; the batons went straight through their head, killing them on the spot. Seeing this, the Humanoid Dalki decided to jump down, but Peter's own Lesser Wights had caught up by then.

The two undead Dalki were the first to charge forward. The humanoid Dalki sliced their arms with its sharp claws, which fell off like gauges on the spot. Still, they were alive, and even without their arms, they were able to hit the humanoid Dalki.

"You've never fought against an undead, have you!" Peter smiled and got right in the centre, swinging the baton he would use, digging it right into the Dalki's stomach, and lifting it in the air. As soon as it fell back, the Dalki began to spin its body like a drill, and the claws shredded the body of the two undead Dalki within seconds.

Then it looked like Peter was the one that was about to get hit next. However, a quick tail slashed at the hard hands, knocking the Dalki to the side, and a large fist from the headless man punched the humanoid Dalki to the ground.

Before he could react, Peter was already above him.

"Your heart is here, right?" Peter said, and without hesitation, he stuck his baton type weapon, the tonfa, right through the chest. It wasn't a sharp weapon, but it didn't matter with his strength, and soon the heart was crushed in the ice.

The humanoid Dalki, which everyone feared and talked about, was dealt by Peter without a scratch on him, but this wasn't the end because the Dalki, in the fortress, soon jumped down and were coming towards them.

"Thank you..for making my job a little bit easier," Peter said, placing his hand on top of the humanoid Dalki. "Wake up!" He shouted, and in less than a second, the Dalki's eyes opened.

*****

Chapter 1532 - The stronger Group

If one was to watch the fight between Peter and the new Gen Dalki, they would have called it one-sided, but for the first time, it wouldn't be the humans being overwhelmed; instead, it was the Dalki.

So far, many of the groups had struggled against the new overpowering Dalki, but in the case of Peter, he turned out to be the perfect nemesis of them.

He himself was a strong force, but of course, there had been many strong people in the other forces too, but the difference was that Peter's strength didn't just come from himself but even from those he rose. On top of that, any difficult enemy he would face and defeat would join his side in the next battle. Using the power of all those that Peter had risen before, including himself, they were able to finish off the humanoid Dalki swiftly, and then he added it to his super team.

Still, he wasn't the only reason why this group, in particular, was able to do well. It was because of the Sixth family's ability as well. The ability to create zones and traps. Once stepped on them, the Dalki would freeze in place.

More than anything, this gave the people time. While the Dalki were trapped, they would be vulnerable to those that were strong enough to deal with them. It also allowed the others to regroup and attack at once.

Like the power of the sixth family, the humans had employed similar techniques to delay the Dalki. Even though they were the attackers, they relied on this and used it on the Dalki until Peter, his lesser Wights, or the Sixth family leader himself, killed them.

All of these things put together easily defeated the Dalki fortress that contained the new Gen Dalki. In total, from the beginning until now, Peter managed to retain around sixty percent of his initial forces, which was far better than any of the other group's performances.

They had taken over the fortress, and Peter was still in good shape. After taking over the place, they docked the ship nearby.

Onboard there were special meals just for him that he could use to restore his energy and strength. Although he only needed to eat them when he would get injured, it was almost impossible for him to with Legs around.

"It looks like you really were one of the strongest ones out of the lot… I would be interested in fighting you now at your strongest." Peter stated, but there was no response from Legs.

"There's been no response from Sam yet; he must be busy," Jake informed. "What should we do now? Do we go to the other planets that need support?"

"No," Peter replied quite quickly. "That wasn't in the plan, and by the time we got there, it would already be too late anyway. Let's stay in this part for now until we get further orders. We'll send out a few scout ships to try and find the main Dalki mothership that Sam was talking about.

Once we find it, we will inform Logan. He wanted to take a reading and scout the number of Dalki's in it."

There was a reason for this. Sam wanted all of the nine battles to be over and done with and then attack the main base with the combined forces. Or if they only had the Demon tier dragon to deal with, only send a few of them.

It would be more beneficial for them just to send in those that could deal with the new Gen Dalki. After all, it was clear that in most of the groups, the majority of the forces couldn't handle the new Dalki.

———

Although at first, it seemed like only one group had great success in fighting off the Dalki. However, there was another one: The Blade Family.

There was no grand battle on the Cursed faction planet they instructed to take back.

Vorden and the others had decided to let the surrendered Dalki live after getting Sam's instructions.

Currently, they were walking on a rock filled planet. And to be honest, they felt that they might experience something similar on this Dalki planet too.

The planet had large rocks spread over that and were spread out on the sandy surface. The sand wasn't deep like in a desert; instead, it was somewhat shallow.

"Are you upset, Raten?" Vorden asked as the group continued to march towards the suspected Dalki fortress.

"Hmph...I can't entirely agree with Sam's orders." Raten replied. "We know that Graham isn't here; we know that Graham also isn't on the base where the Demon tier dragon is. So why aren't we trying to hunt down Graham, their leader, instead?

"The Dalki aren't strong; he is. Without him, there is no Dalki in this war."

Thinking about it, Vorden and the others wondered the same thing. Now that they have dealt with Slicer and One Horn, was there anyone other than Graham that could take someone on like Sil?

"I think the point is that there might be those that are evolving," Borden answered. "We all fought against Slicer, and sure we weren't as strong as we are now, but, even if we kill Graham too, as long as the Dragon exists, more Grahams or more Slicers will come up."

"I don't know." Sil finally spoke. "I don't know if we are strong enough yet. Ever since fighting against Graham, I don't know if there is anyone strong enough. I know everyone is relying on Quinn, but if he isn't, it means that someone else will have to take him out."

"And it will be my pleasure when the time comes." Raten laughed while puffing his chest and folding his arms.

Up ahead, they suddenly noticed the Dalki fortress on a large slab of rock.

"Alright, everyone, stop here!" Vorden shouted, and the others paused, turning their attention on him as he continued, "I have decided that only a few of us are going to go in and scout ahead. We all know the reports on the new Gen Dalki and the fortress. They are strong, and in the fortress, there's no Dalki under two spikes. I don't want us losing our numbers over nothing."

"Wait!" Shiro called. He had come along with the Blades since he had made friends with a lot of them. "Are you saying just the four of you are going to take on the fortress? If we are with you, then at least we can distract them!"

"Are you saying that I should use you guys? Do you really think we are that weak!" Vorden shouted with his wings unfolding. "If we can't take them on, then it means that all of you would have just died anyway."

The others gulped upon hearing this and didn't argue anymore, allowing Blade Family to do however it wanted. They had gotten this far because of them in the first place, so right now, all they could do was trust them.

Sil had already gotten the powers that he needed from the others. Borden took out one of the syringes from Sil and held it in his hand, ready to take it. For now, though, he hopped onto Vorden's back instead.

All four of them were off to the fortress in the next second. Similar to the Peter situation against the other Dalki...it was a one-sided battle and a victory for the Blade family.

The weakest of the Blade's was Borden, who could amount to a four spike, but he had better skills than the others, and his strength seemed to be above most of them. Still, he didn't have to worry about getting badly injured because he knew the others around him were far more powerful.

Two Demon tier beasts could kill multiple of the Dalki. Raten, using his mud ability, was able to trap and kill multiple enemies at the same time. Vorden had amassed great speed in the air and wind powers in his beast form.

His wings were razor-sharp like giant steel blades. He was unmatched in the air, and swooping down, he would slice the Dalki that came in his range. Of course, then there was Sil, the strongest of them all.

Over time, with fighting the others, Sil had gathered abilities best suited to go against the Dalki. To them, the new Gen Dalki was just as easy as facing the normal Dalki because it was just a number.

———

While these two forces fought, someone was on a special mission.

After leaving Owen and the Graylash group, Nate flew around the Dalki beast planet sector, looking for the main Dalki base.

He honestly didn't know where to go, but the radar at least helped him know of the places where he had passed through, and due to it being linked to the other ships, he also knew where it wasn't, which meant he had narrowed down his search area so he could find it.

"Man... I kinda want to find it, and I kinda don't." Nate thought, but his mind was honestly thinking about other things that happened. Still, as he was drifting through space, and then, his radar screen began to blip.

It was the first thing that gave an energy signal other than the other planets he had come across.

It took him some time to reach it upon moving head to look at where the energy signal was coming from.

There was a ship as big as the Earth's moon not far from him, and he knew it was the Dalki base.

Chapter 1533 - The last Leg

Sam and the rest had docked on the rocky planet with a frozen-wave-like surface and were waiting to make the next move. They had plenty of supplies to last them a while, and they hadn't really been there for long despite how long it felt to the army.

With nothing much to do and knowing that they would soon go into battle, time just felt like a standstill to them all.

They had set up somewhat of a base near the main ship and the other fleet of ships. Groups were taking turns to keep watch in all directions and would come back for reports. In truth, they weren't needed because, on top of that, Logan had set up sensors just in case anything unexpected came their way.

Since they noticed that the Dalki were no longer leaving their fortresses, the group believed they were safe. For the time being, they weren't attacking the Dalki fortress, which also had the new gen. Although, a few in the army wanted to act straight away.

In particular, Ivy and Peach, and even Layla. Although their reasons were understandable.

Sam was with Logan, and they had set up their own office space outside next to the spaceships. Several large crates of supplies were stacked together and placed adjacent to create temporary tables and a workplace.

Logan had several screens in front of him, and through them, he was analysing and sharing all of the information they had received from all the groups. It amazed Sam how Logan was able to work from anywhere and would always turn that area into such a mess. As there were small gadgets everywhere that Logan would play with when he had nothing else to do.

Currently, Sam was thinking back to when they had first discovered the Dalki fortress.

——

"That's.. that's…." Peach sobbed her eyes out, and so did her sister Ivy next to her. While one was a wreck of emotions, the other was comforting her, but she too was clearly in pain, as well.

"I can't believe it; those bastards really did it!" Layla controlled her urge to shout, afraid that she might blow away their cover.

"It looks like they have figured out a way to imprint specific D.N.A. into the new Dalki they have created. Perhaps a more complete Borden?" Logan spoke to himself.

"You..!" Layla gritted her teeth, picking up Logan by the scruff of his shirt and holding him up in the air. His feet were dangling off the ground. "Is that all you have to say...she...is..."

"That thing isn't her," Sam said, placing his hand on her shoulder. "Logan was just making an observation. He wasn't the one that created that thing. They used her D.N.A., mixed with the Demon tier beast, to create that. I understand how you feel. It's disgusting and disrespectful to see the Dalki do that to her. But why are you lashing out at Logan?"

Letting go of Logan, Layla quickly apologised and even bowed down. Sam was right. It was just unexpected to see Helen like that of all things.

"Alright, so what's the plan? I'm happy to go out in front and take those guys down." Layla declared and was already gripping the sword's hilt in her hand.

"For now…I think the best decision would be to wait." Sam suggested.

"Wait? But we came here to fight; what's the use of waiting?!" Peach, who was on the ground, shouted in rage. The two sisters were ready to kill whatever that imitation of their sister was, and the group with them, which was mainly composed of those in the Daisy faction, felt the same.

"Let me explain it to you." Sam sighed. "Out of all the planets in the Beast solar system, this one is located right in the centre. It's a strategic location for the Dalki. They can support the other groups from left to the right, and they can even continue going forward and enter our part of the solar system.

"On top of that, if the main Dalki base is located behind it like I suspect it is, they can even go to support that group as well. Right now, while we are here observing them, we are making them stay put.

"If they try to move, we can attack them right here and do more damage, losing negligible forces. However, I believe they already know this. Maybe they just didn't think that we would get here that fast. Now, if we camp here, it will work as good intimidation, and these Dalki will be forced to remain in their fortress, unable to help any of the other fortresses.

"So, for now, let's just wait and see how the other groups are doing."

———

Thinking back to that, it looked like Sam had finally received all the information that he needed to make his own move in this war as well.

'Out of the nine battles so far, both Graylash families won their battles. Owen and Grim have retreated but lost too much from their groups. Then from the Cursed faction, Graham was last seen by them.

'From what we have heard…the group and Sunny have lost the battle there. Where Graham is now, we have no idea. We lost Sach to One Horn, but his group defeated him. Because of that, now the Dalki from one of the planets is heading towards the Daisy faction. Honestly, this is one of my major worries.

'Still, the good news is that the other two Earthborn groups will most likely win their battles, but whether we can utilise their forces after that is another thing altogether. Then out of the Cursed faction, the Blade's and Peter have done remarkably well.'

There was one thing they were waiting for. After Nate had discovered the main Dalki base, they were trying to get energy reading's from it. The problem was, just as Sam had suspected, the main Dalki base was behind the current planet they were on.

No matter what, since the forces from this planet could not support the main base, they needed to take it out. Finally, though, an energy reading had come back from the main planet.

"I don't know whether we are lucky or unlucky," Logan said. "The energy reading on the Dalki planet itself is the same as the forces so far on the other planets."

To Sam, this was good news because it meant the Dalki would be no more challenging than what they had faced so far. This also meant that there was no need to send an army of humans; a strong team would suffice to go and deal with the situation.

"Send an order out." Sam finally said after thinking about it for a while. "Nate, the Blades, Fex, Linda, Peter, Jake Muscat are to head on to take out the Demon tier beast and will enter the Dalki planet alone.

"As for us, it's time for us to make a move as well. We will proceed to attack the Dalki fortress. Once we are done here, we will split up our forces. Some of us will head to the main Dalki base to support Nate and the others, while the others will return to the Daisy faction to defend."

Logan understood and sent out the order, but there was one nail biting volatile factor in Sam's plan who could disrupt their whole plan: Graham.

Graham would most likely be making his next move right now, and in Sam's head, there were three options. Graham alone was a strong enough force to try and take out the planets that we had just claimed, destroying the weakened forces one by one. This was the most unlikely option, but Sam imagined it would cause them the most trouble since he would have to manoeuvre everyone as quickly as possible to defend.

However, the other two options that were likely would make either one fail. Graham would either go back to defend the Dalki main base planet to protect his precious Demon tier beast. Or the most likely option, which Sam hadn't told anyone yet based on his personality.

Soon, he would join the attack force on the Daisy planet and take it down.

'Graham...I hope I'm not right...You are confident in your strength, and that's why you've left us the demon tier beast. Why does the main ship matter if you can kill us all to get your demon tier beast back?

'But if that's the case…we have won this battle, and then it will just be down to Quinn and Graham to battle it out. I feel bad for the vampire settlement, but this is the best choice.'

——

Just then, in the very same vampire settlement, most of the vampires were staying in their homes. However, a few would remain stationed on the strongly fortified walls, and they were even those who would stand in the defensive towers their king had built.

They looked outward to see if they could spot anything since all of the vampires were alerted of the incoming attack. With no leaders to help them currently, they were on their own for now.

"They're here, I see it!" One of the vampires shouted down to the rest.

They sounded an alarm, and now all the vampires knew the war for survival was about to begin because off in the distance, above beautiful flower meadows, there was a Dalki mothership coming towards them.

*****

Chapter 1534 - A second chance to win

The decision had been made and everyone was informed about what they needed to do next. They were also made aware of the unfortunate and fortunate events that had happened so far around the beast solar system. However, there was one detail that Sam kept from most, and that was regarding Nicu's death.

They had been informed to be weary and careful if they were to see a black or blonde haired female, and those that knew it was Erin, they were told about it as well. After all, not everyone knew about who Erin was or where she had come from, and Sam was sure that Quinn wanted to keep it that way for now. The good thing was for the vampires that were the least of their worries. However, just when the vampire settlement was about to be attacked. Sam believed it was better that they didn't know the first leader had died during battle.

Still, there was one more group that hadn't been made aware of what had happened with Erin, and that was Sam's own group. This was because if they did see her, he could warn them on the spot, and at the same time, there was one person in the group that was already emotionally unstable as it was. If he were to add to that, Sam didn't know what would happen and if her life was to be lost in this battle as well, he didn't know how that person in particular would act.

"So, what's the plan?" Dennis asked, as the leaders walked out front, and the group was heading towards the fortress. The current group was half the size that it originally was, as Sam had left half of them behind to look after the Ship.

There were two reasons for this. One of them being that they needed to protect the ship if they wanted to head back towards the vampire settlement. Logan had also brought along a portable teleporter, so it wouldn't be too much of a problem.

An anti jammer had also been sent out to Nate and the others to be used once they reached the Dalki home planet. That way, reinforcements couldn't suddenly come. Of course there was a chance they had a way around this, yet Logan thought that to be unlikely.

According to him, they would have to get their hands on his anti jammer device that was different to the Dalki's to reverse engineer it. Worse case scenario, it would at least buy them some time. It certainly was a good thing that Logan was on their side.

Still, there were some great minds that were with the Dalki as well.

The real reason why Sam had decided for half of the forces to stay behind was because they were useless. With the emergency of the New Gen Dalki, the fact that numbers weren't particularly helpful was just further cemented. Only to be used to delay the Dalki to getting them before the others.

Half the force was the number he had come up with, which would determine whether they would be able to beat the New Gen Dalki or not. Losing beyond this number, In the amount of time it would take, if the others hadn't dealt with the Dalki by then they would have lost this battle anyway.

"So far we have only seen one Humanoid Dalki, but there have been cases at other Shelters with them being two." Sam explained. "We will make two teams, one to deal with the humanoid Dalki and the other to help out the attack force against the others."

The two groups were as follows. Vincent, Layla, and the two Daisy sisters were to take on the Humanoid Dalki. While Sam, Dennis, and Logan would lead the rest of the group to raid the fortress and go for the other strong Dalki.

They soon came into sight, and the group split up. There were also a few strong members in the Daisy faction and vampires that would be somewhat supporting the attack force of the humanoid Dalki.

"Move carefully!" Sam ordered as the group were getting ready to sprint across the field at any second. They had ranged ability users, and once they were in range they would send out their attacks first. As powerful as they could, and that was when the rest of them would charge in towards the fortress.

He needed to see how they would react, if they would rush out, or if they would continue to protect the fortress. However, before they had even reached the fortress at a range that the ability users could start their siege, one of the Dalki that was looking out towards them leapt up in the air.

They could see it high up like a small dot, and eventually it crashed and landed on its own out in the open. It wasn't just any Dalki though, it was the humanoid Dalki that had the appearance of Helen.

"Should we charge in?" Dennis asked. "This wasn't in the plan."

It surely wasn't, and as the strategist and leader, Sam now needed to adjust to his plans, but none of the other Dalki were moving out. The next second, though, the Dalki Helen started to speak.

"I've come here with a proposal. " Dalki Helen announced quite loudly. Those around Sam could hear her, but not the humans beyond them. "I know that you vampires can hear me."

"We shouldn't be listening to whatever she has to say. We just need to attack. Now's our chance to take out the humanoid Dalki while she's on her own. I doubt the others can come to help her in time." Vincent advised Sam.

Because of this, Sam gave the nod, but the next second, just as they were all about to move, something sprouted from the ground and readily grabbed Sam. It looked like a Dalki hand had grown from the ground itself.

It soon smashed Sam on the floor and kept him in place.

"You vampires aren't the only ones with good hearing. There will be no sneaky plans, and if you don't agree, I will kill him on the spot.'' Dalki Helen warned them. "My proposal is in the best interest of both our groups. We'll have a duel, your strongest representative against me.

"I have heard the reports of the other places so far. I believe that we all understand the current situation. If you can't defeat me, then it's hopeless for your side, yet if I can't beat your strongest, then it would be the same for my side."

After making this proposal, many of them looked towards Sam to make a decision, but his mouth was covered up. It looked like whatever was holding him in place was made from roots or some type of plant, but at a closer look, it had the same set of scales as the Dalki.

They were all sure that it had to be the Dalki Helen's doing.

"Vincent, you're the next in charge, what do we do?" Dennis asked.

"The proposal might actually be in our favour. Honestly, though, I have trouble believing that the losing side will adhere to the conditions. If we lose, then a battle will probably still break out. If they lose, it would be the same, but it does give us the chance to get rid of the most problematic one.

"The question is… is there a single one among us that is strong enough to fight the humanoid Dalki on their own. She seems to be serious about the duel, since they are holding Sam hostage rather than killing him. … It also means we have to take part if we don't want to lose him."

"Shall I make things easier for you?" Dalki questioned.

The next moment, the strange roots started to move, still moving on to Sam. However, they were moving away from the fortress, as well as the attacking forces. The roots stopped when they were a fair distance away from everyone.

"You're correct, you don't really have a choice if you want to save him. If you win, I assure you that I will do everything in my power to make sure the rest of the Dalki don't act. Can't you see, all of them are being good little boys right now and staying back there?

"They listen to me, so don't worry about that. I offer you this proposal because I just want to protect as many of their lives as possible, just like you do on your side. A duel should decide things while also minimising the loss of life."

With the conditions made, and the situation they were all in, it was hard for them to really say no to the proposal, even if it felt more like blackmail. So now, they needed to decide who would be the one to come forward.

The sisters looked at each other, they wanted to go and get revenge for Helen, killing this cheap imitation of her. However, their strength relied on each other and they were unsure if they could do the job, especially since Dalki Helen only wanted to fight a single person.

"I guess, I'm the best shot we have." Vincent eventually stated. "I'm just as strong as Quinn and I have a lot of experience, on top of that I can use my Blood powers. However, that's it, I don't have an ability… but I still think I'm the best chance we have."

.They had seen Vincent's strength, he was indeed strong, but… was that enough?

"No." One person disagreed, already walking in front of the others. "Vincent, I'm sorry, but I want to take this one. I think I'm the best chance we have. I know you're strong, probably stronger than me… but this is more of a personal matter for me. Furthermore, I have to do this, and I promise I will take her down… no matter the price I have to pay for it."

With that, Layla walked in front of the others. Hearing such conviction in her voice, Vincent couldn't really do anything but smile.

"Good luck."

Layla stood a good few metres away from the Dalki Helen, and the two were quite far away from the fortress and the attack force. Far away from them not to get involved.

'I lost to you once in a duel… and I guess this is my chance to make up for that. I will free you from your pain, Helen.'

*****

Chapter 1535 - A rematch of the Century

Everyone was carefully watching the fight that was about to happen in front of them. Their hands were tense as they were preparing to rush in at any moment. A lot of them had already decided that if the fight looked to be going one way, then they would have no choice, to jump in.

Hopefully, they would be so overwhelmed that they wouldn't have time to get rid of Sam. Still, they at least hoped that Layla would be enough to defeat the humanoid Dalki leader in front of them.

"Is she strong?" Ruby, who had come along on this trip, asked. She had hardly done any fighting so far, but there were a lot of those that had this same thought, they had seen Layla fight but during the fight she had used nothing but her arrows. Sure it was stronger than them but enough to send her out instead of the others?

"I think she has a good chance." Ivy answered. "A long time ago, our sister told us that she had a fight with the very girl that is fighting now. I know that isn't our sister out there, but if she has her D.N.A, I have no doubt that this humanoid Dalki will be strong.

"Although our sister had defeated that girl, she told us that she was one of the most amazing people she had ever fought against. Helen even admitted that she had the feeling that one day, Layla might be able to surpass her."

Although it was nice hearing those words, Vincent thought otherwise. This wasn't just Helen, no, it was some type of Super Helen mixed in with a Demon tier beast. Sure, Layla had significantly gotten stronger in a short amount of time, but without a doubt Dalki Helen was stronger than her human counterpart.

'We don't even know how many spikes she has on her back… the ones we have seen so far had been four spikes. Can Layla defeat something stronger than a four spike on her own?' Vincent worried about that possibility, especially since Layla's forte so far had been supporting her allies over going in alone.

What's more, from the reports they had received the New Gen Dalki with four spikes were clearly stronger than their more beast-like brethren, though fortunately not as strong as five spike Dalki leader yet.

The next second, while having his thoughts, Vincent's eyes widened as Dalki Helen prepared to get into battle, twisting her body side to side.

"Someone, please tell me that I'm just bad at counting." Dennis pleaded, but the others saw the same thing.

All of them there could clearly see that the humanoid Dalki with Helen's appearance had a total of five spikes.

"This isn't good… if all the New Gen Dalki are stronger than the old version, then she might surpass the Dalki leaders!" Vincent shouted. "We have to get her out, otherwise she'll die!!!"

No matter how strong Layla might be, it would be suicide to have her solo someone like One Horn, Green Horn or Slicer… much less, if Dalki Helen actually surpassed them!

'Sam was right, we have to get rid of the Dragon before they can create more of these monsters, but now without Quinn I'm afraid that we might not make it out of this one alive.'

Just then, Vincent shuffled forward, yet the strange vine-like structure that still held Sam hostage tightened its grip, and they all could hear the sound of his muffled screams.

"Are you trying to back out of our deal?" Helen Dalki questioned them, annoyed. "Even if you lose, I'll allow you to get off this planet. However, you've made your choice. Just pray this girl can entertain me for a while!"

'She doesn't seem to regard us as a threat, yet she's still keeping an eye on us. She's right, the only thing we can hope for, is that Layla is somehow able to do a good enough job to get her full attention. Then, once we've saved Sam, we can try to back her up. Until then, we're just going to have to wait for Quinn to be done with whatever he's doing.'

Standing there, the fight looked like it was about to start. Layla placed her bow on her back and instead drew out her black sword. It didn't take long for her to gather her negative emotions, because there were plenty of negative emotions to take from herself due to the form the Dalki before her had.

It didn't take long for her body to start to change. The others hadn't seen Layla take this form in front of them, but the horns started to appear on her head, her fangs widened, and her eyes started to glow red as she took on the True Hannya form.

"I'm glad that it's you I'm fighting. I don't know why, but I can feel my blood boiling when I see you before me. Keep going, I wish to go all out against you!" Helen shouted, and stomped her foot onto the ground.

A few seconds later, Layla could feel the earth rumbling underneath her. She soon started to move from the spot where another strange root came bursting from the ground. Just like the one that had captured Sam, it too had Dalki parts.

After shooting out, they didn't stop, instead they began chasing her. Jumping, Layla dodged a few of them, and landed on top of the trunk of another, but soon after another one of the roots came through the ground underneath her.

Layla could see the end of the root resembled something similar to that of a Dalki hand. Seeing this, she swung her sword with as much force as possible but was unable to cut the strange root.

'These scales are actually as hard as a Dalki's. The sword doesn't allow me to use Qi, without it, I might never be able to cut this thing.'

She continued to skid across the top, and started to focus the first stage of Qi into her arms, giving her more strength but even then it seemed too much. As a last ditch effort, opening her mouth, flames spread onto the roots.

The flames were large, and covered the entire area, and the next second, out from the other end, Layla was seen heading straight towards Helen, with five arrows hovering around her and spinning. Blue flames had also covered her hands, giving her another buff in power.

All five of the arrows were aimed towards Helen, and were spiralling in different directions, trying to go towards her. Layla was showing no fear as she ran ahead. Thrusting her sword at the same time, as the arrows came in for the attack, she was planning to get in a clear strike.

'Her body isn't covered in scales like the rest, this has to be her weakness!' She thought as she thrusted it forward. The arrows went towards the back, but before they could reach Dalki Helen's roots sprung from behind it as well, grabbing the arrows midair.

As for the front, Helen had stopped the attack with her bare hand.

"This sword is a good sword… I can't even break it using my strength, but it's a shame." Helen sighed. "I was looking forward to a good fight… Is this really the best you got?"

A strong kick was directed at Layla, hitting her in the stomach Layla refused to let go but Helen felt something strange and released, it caused Layla's body to suddenly slide across the floor. Placing her sword in the ground and using her abilities, she soon stopped herself. It was a strong kick that had come from Dalki Helen, who thought that it would be enough to kill the female human, but Layla looked strangely unhurt.

She didn't seem injured, nor was there so much as blood coming from her mouth. She had used the second stage to block the attack, but that was it. Meanwhile, where the others were, Ivy had collapsed and fallen to the floor out of nowhere. It looked like her stomach had been completely destroyed… worst of all, she was dead.

Vincent turned, wondering what was going on, and he couldn't quite believe it.

'Layla… when did she use the Spiritual Link?'

It was a skill of the Hannya, to create a link with another and all damage that would be done to her, would be redirected to another. At first, Layla thought that the skill could only be used one way, where she would take the damage to the other person.

But she had realised something, she wasn't quite sure, but she had feelings while in this form, she could have it go the other way. She was hoping to use it on Helen Dalki, but there seemed to be a condition.

The receiving person needed to be willing to accept the backlash. Layla, beforehand, had informed the sisters that this might be something she needed to do. Both of them had agreed, and the two of them now had a Spiritual Link with Layla. They would take on the damage that she was meant to take.

What none of them had expected was that a single hit from Dalki Helen would kill one of them on the spot.

'NOOOOO!!!! I'm so sorry, Ivy… I NEVER INTENDED for this to happen… I planned to heal you with my green fire… I hope you'll be able to forgive me, Peach… First Helen, and now you've lost Ivy because of me. I-I… I've already gone too far. I-I have to finish this fight.' Layla strengthened her determination as she cancelled the Spiritual Link, unwilling to be responsible for another death.

Fuelled by anger, Layla summoned countless black balls. These were the floating balls of the Spiritual Chains. However, she had a feeling that it wouldn't be enough. At best, it might be able to hold Helen for a few seconds, even before she could move.

"It looks like you have some tricks up your sleeve." Dalki Helen let out a smile, as she got ready to charge her opponent. "I guess this fight might actually entertain me, after all. Now, try not to die too quickly!"

"I know I've lost against you last time, Helen… but I promise you I'll win this time." Layla stated, as she focused and a bright light was starting to form inside her.

"I know I'm weak, and that most of my power is not my own. This form I got because of Quinn, the large Qi reserve I got from my mother, and now… I even had one of your sisters pay the price of her life, while I was the one fighting you…

"However, I learnt that borrowing powers from others is my power, and I'll do whatever it takes to beat you!!!"

Layla was summoning out her soul weapon.

*****

Chapter 1536 - A Third type of Soul Weapon

While Layla was in the middle of summoning her soul weapon, she started to recall her lessons with Leo and Erin. Before they had gone on the offensive against the Dalki, she had enjoyed the opportunity to train with the two great swordsmen.

Leo had stated that there was a way for both of them to increase their power drastically and fast. However, to do that, she would have to unlock her soul weapon…

——

Both Erin and Layla were in the training room together. Their swords were constantly clashing against each other. The Hannya was currently in her second form, as she continued to block attack after attack from the aggressive Dhampir.

Layla was using everything in her power to block Erin's attack, including her Qi. In the end, though, the difference in experience resulted in the former slipping up. One of the latter's strikes had hit her too hard and too many times causing a slip in concentration which caused her feet to tumble and for her to fall to the ground slightly. The next second, Layla found Erin's blade pointed towards her neck.

Pulling it back, Erin offered her hand, the two of them were covered in sweat.

"You did good, Layla. For someone who started out with a different weapon and is trying to switch, you are improving fast." Erin praised the other young woman, as the two of them took a break.

Layla didn't reply straight away, still trying to catch her breath, whereas Erin had already regained hers. Leo looked to be waiting for Layla to get back in fighting condition before they could move onto the next part.

"You… were going easy on me, weren't you?" Layla eventually asked. "Just be honest. How am I meant to improve if you're holding back?"

"If you're talking about the strength in my strikes, then I can assure you that I wasn't holding back. You have to remember your sword is special, and your Qi powers are strong." Erin reassured her, hitting her friend on the shoulder.

"If you're talking about skill, then yes, I didn't aim to cripple or incapacitate you. Learning swordsmanship is like learning a musical instrument. There are many techniques and styles, but each one of them has a foundation. If you haven't learned the basics, then me doing all the other stuff will mean nothing to you. Besides, that wasn't the point of today's training."

"Alright you two." Leo clapped his hands to get their attention, as he turned around. "I believe you have had enough rest. It's time to move onto the next part."

The two girls got up, and stood a few metres apart from each other. Soon they closed their eyes and started to focus. They had been doing this for the last few days now, which was why Leo had said nothing. They were both training to summon their soul weapon.

Pushing one to the edge was meant to help summon it, yet at the same time, they needed to focus, which was why Leo was training them in this manner with small breaks in between. However, as they continued to focus Layla could feel… absolutely nothing.

The same could not be said about Erin, though. When Layla looked over, she could see a warm glow starting to appear, but it soon vanished on the spot, going away just like that.

"It looks like you are coming quite a way. Let's take a break for now." Leo suggested.

The girls were taking a break, or at least Layla was. Erin continued practising her swordsmanship, and without a partner that was considerably weaker than her to slow her down, she fully displayed her skills.

"Your aura is all over the place. Tell me what's wrong?" Leo asked as he had walked to her side.

Layla sighed since the answer was pretty obvious.

"I don't feel like I'm even a single step closer than when we started. Last time we tried that soul weapon machine, and it didn't work for me either. I thought that might be because I am a vampire subclass but still…

"That can't be the case, since Erin seems to have one, and the vampires, while they don't seem to have one, they're at least able to summon an inner blood weapon. Quinn is even able to do some sort of mix of both, whereas I… Is there something wrong with me? Am I just not meant to have either?" She asked, clearly frustrated.

Before answering, Leo looked towards Erin's way and the two of them watched her swordsmanship for a while, until the Blind Swordsman eventually answered.

"Did you know, I didn't discover my soul weapon until very late in my life, Layla. My teacher used to praise me for being a rare genius and true talent for Qi, yet I couldn't summon a soul weapon like everyone else.

"There was a point in time when I felt exactly the same way as you are now."

Layla was finding this hard to believe, and it seemed more like a story he had come up with to make her feel better. Leo seemed so wise and perfect in everything, yet she also knew he was a true master of hard work and discipline. If anyone could defeat a being above them with skill, it was this person.

"According to my master, soul weapons can be categorised into two types, the item type and the enhancement type. However, I believe that is actually a third group." Leo started to explain. "The item type is simple enough. Once you get the hang of forming your soul into a ball in your hand, an item can be produced. It's quite clear when you have achieved it, but learning the ins and outs of the item itself can be hard.

"The enhancement type, though, has always been different from user to user. Sometimes it can be very clear when a soul weapon has been summoned, while at other times it isn't quite as straight forward.

"The latter is similar to my soul weapon. It enhanced my abilities but to what degree. That was difficult in itself to find out or discover. The reason I believe you are struggling right now is because rather than figuring out how to summon your soul weapon, you need to figure out what it would do.

"The process might sound backwards for people like me and you, and in some ways we might never figure out what our soul weapons are."

At first, Layla thought that maybe Leo was giving her hope, but the last sentence truly frightened her, and she soon stood up from the ground in a panic.

"But didn't you just say, you did?" Layla questioned him. "How did you figure out your soul weapon without summoning it, then?"

"The same way that you and Erin have been doing so far. We have been attempting to put you in life or death situations. In a way, this is similar to the training Hilston Blade had forced his family to undergo, but you probably know the answer to that yourself.

"Think, is there something that you have been able to do that others can't? That was when it first hit me. When I told my master, I was able to manipulate the aura I could see and feel. That was something that he couldn't do."

Pondering about this question for a while, it had eventually hit Layla, there was something that she could do, that combined all her powers. Could that be her soul weapon?

——

Back on the field, Layla opened her eyes wide, as the soul weapon spread through her body and she could feel energy burning through her fingertips.

"I thank Quinn for giving me this special body, without it, I don't think I would have ever been able to utilise my soul weapon properly!" Layla shouted towards Helen.

"Quinn…" Dalki Helen uttered the name with a strange expression on her face.

When using her powers of telekinesis, Layla had already been able to transfer her Qi to others. She could power her arrows with Qi, and transfer what was of hers into another body. This was something that she could do that others couldn't.

A soul weapon adapted and formed based on the user, and for Layla it was clearly something she could use.

"I… I feel weaker." Dennis suddenly said, but it wasn't only him. All the others, including the large army of fifty thousand or so, all started to feel as if part of their strength had disappeared. At the same time, the humanoid Dalki itself could feel her energy being drained away.

While Layla could give others Qi, her soul weapon allowed her to steal Qi from others and add it to her own. Right now, she was draining everyone nearby.

*****

Chapter 1537 - Calling to me 

When using her soul weapon, and absorbing the energy from those around her, Layla needed to be a little careful. For one, she knew that not everyone practised Qi. It would be very dangerous to take away a large amount from those people, since it was their life force.

Luckily, there were more than enough people around, that the process would hopefully just weaken them temporarily. Unfortunately, taking in that energy wasn't easy. It worked similarly to her telekinesis ability. Where she had to use her ability on each one as if she was lifting a force from them.

After absorbing so much energy, Layla stood there and took a stance with her sword. Her skin appeared to be somewhat glowing, making the black sword stand out even more.

"Now, things are starting to get exciting." Helen Dalki grinned as she looked at her own hand. "I can feel you sapping away the energy from my own body at this very second. As much as I would love to see how strong you can get… I won't just stand around and wait for you to be finished."

Throwing out her very own arm from around twenty or so metres away, it started to extend. The Dalki part of it became similar to the strange looking vines. Seeing this, Layla lifted her sword up above her head.

She gathered as much Qi as she could and waited for the perfect time. The Hannya could see the hand approach her. Swinging down, the black sword clashed against the hard scales and fingertips, but the next second the fingers gripped onto the weapon.

"Too bad, looks like my scales are still stronger than your attack." With this, Dalki Helen retracted her arm, and since Layla refused to let go of the black sword her body was being dragged across the field.

'Even with that much Qi, I still can't hurt her?! Just how strong are these New Gen Dalki?!' Layla started to panic somewhat. 'No, I have to calm down. I can't hurry the process… if I drain too much energy, I'll be responsible for more deaths than just Ivy's.

"The longer the fight lasts, the stronger my attacks will be. I'll just have to keep her occupied until I'm strong enough to defeat her! I'll aim for that fleshy body of hers.'

Just as Layla was about to reach Helen Dalki, the Qi was concentrated in her arms, swinging the sword, she moved one of the arms to the side. Still, Helen Dalki was fast and used her other hand to throw a punch towards Layla's face.

However, the young woman wasn't just idling. Layla threw out a black ball and the second it touched Helen, black chains surrounded her, freezing her in place. The Spiritual Chains broke easily, unable to hold down the humanoid Dalki's great strength.

Nevertheless, it bought her opponent a fraction of a second… and that was all she needed to swoop around to the side, and ready the black sword.

In the middle of her strike, though, something burst through the ground again. Placing her sword below, she managed to somewhat stop it, and if she was a second later, then she would have been done for.

'Time… I just need more time to beat her!' Layla thought.

Right now, Helen Dalki didn't seem to be too greatly affected by Layla's soul weapon. Unfortunately for the Hannya, she was unable to control the speed of each individual draining target. As such, the humanoid Dalki was moving just as fast as before.

With one hand out, Layla pushed herself with her ability, allowing the vine to continue going upward, but soon another one came towards her.

"How many of these things are there?!"

Taking a swing, Layla planned to hit it away like she had done all the others. When she swung, it hit nothing but thin air. The vine-like arm had bent avoiding the blow and as quick as it avoided the blow it came out and reached grabbing Layla's left arm.

'That's not good, she got me!'

Seeing this, the other vine-like arm from before, was now heading straight for Layla, she had to think fast, and she only saw one option. With the black blade, she swung just past her own shoulder. The Qi that would have been covering that area she got rid of it, and now one arm was left with the Dalki, before she eventually landed on the floor.

Blood was spewing on the ground, but slowly the wound was starting to heal, and using her green flame she spat out from her mouth, it healed quicker than before.

"She lost a freaking arm!" Dennis shouted. "We have to help her! I don't care if she might be getting stronger, there is no way she's going to win this battle unless we intervene!!!"

That was when Vincent looked over toward Sam to see if he was okay. He looked to be still wrapped up by one of those strange vines.

'In the fight so far, Helen Dalki has only used two of those strange vine arms most of the time. But there have been some instances where she has used four like when she had blocked those arrows, then there is one wrapped around Sam as well.

'We don't know if there aren't more of these things around. This humanoid five spike Dalki, is too much… I'm not even sure, I could handle her on my own. How many casualties will we have if we try to fight her… , and our forces are being weakened due to Layla's power.'

However, there was one person that was acting and Vincent knew it. Logan had dispersed some of his spiders to have a look and move over to Sam's position. Still, there was a big problem, because the strange vine-like arms scales were just as hard as those on a normal Dalki. It was unlikely that Logan could do anything without getting Dalki Helen's attention.

Layla was no longer bleeding, but she was now down one arm, which was now with Dalki Helen. The vine had retracted and handed the arm back over to Helen. To which she threw off into the grand distance far away, almost landing right where Sam was.

"I thought that perhaps with that yellow glow all over your body you would have gotten stronger, but that doesn't seem to be the case at all." Dalki Helen sighed in disappointment, pushing off the ground, and coming for the attack. One punch, Layla gathered a second stage of Qi, to create some type of barrier wall and block the attack.

She held the black sword in place as well. The punch broke through the qi barrier, and hit the sword, causing Layla to skid across the ground. Her remaining hand felt numb without the support of the other, taking the hit despite all the power she had.

'I'll stop taking the Qi from all the others, and just focus on taking it from her!' Layla decided. Doing this, the increase she was gaining in power was lessened, but the drain on her opponent should be more effective. Helen Dalki continued to punch, and all Layla could do was create Qi barriers and use the first stage to empower herself to block attack after attack.

When looking at Dalki Helen this way, and Layla blocking attack after attack, it reminded the young woman of when she was training against Erin. Too weak to do anything, too weak to retaliate.

'What would they do…what would they have done if they were in the same situation... ' The Hannya wondered.

"You're good at blocking, but you will never win a fight this way. Don't you care about the people behind you! Do you even care about anyone but yourself? Is this all you can do… I thought you wanted to help Quinn? What's the use of him having someone so weak by his side like you? You don't deserve him!" Finishing these words, four of the strange vine's rose up behind Helen's back.

It was now as if she had a set of six arms on her. The strange vines and the Dalki's own arms.

'I can't block it... I can't block enough of the attack... and she isn't getting weaker…am I going to die here?' Layla didn't want to accept such a fate.

Her hand started to shake, and Layla initially thought it was due to her trembling. The next moment, she realised that wasn't the case, and that the black sword was shaking on its own. Layla thought she was hallucinating, but a weak voice seemed to whisper something to her.

'Let me…take over…'

Listening to it carefully, and feeling the power, without a doubt the sound was originating from her own weapon.

*****

Chapter 1538 - The Black Sword Strength

So far, everything Layla had tried to do had been insufficient to deal with her opponent. She was at a loss and now, with six Dalki arms coming towards her, the Hannya thought that this might be how things were going to end.

'If I die here now… after having weakened everyone, they will have no chance to take over the place… I would have not just failed everyone but made it worse for the others…'

Looking over at Sam, and feeling the worries of the people behind her, Layla was desperately looking for some way out of the dire situation. Alas, there was no sudden boost in power, or growing emotions that would help her overcome this one.

However, the departure call seemed to resonate with someone, or perhaps it was more correct to say something.

"Let me take over!" The voice shouted, and the black sword in her hand was shaking even more. Layla had figured out where the voice in her head was coming from. The question was should she trust it or give in to the strange power she had heard for the first time.

However, in the end, what other choice did she have? Layla could feel a strange energy coming from the sword itself. She wasn't sure what it meant by 'take over', but she could tell that the weapon wanted her to stop resisting.

She allowed the Qi that had surrounded her body to dissipate, and at the same time, Helen felt the sapping energy disappear. Instead, a strange energy started to run up Layla's arm and circulated throughout her body.

While all of this happened, strange voices began to resonate in the Hannya's head. Layla could hear soul-chilling screams, the sounds of crying that told of a pain like no other. It didn't take her long to start regretting her decision, but at least the sword had not lied to her. While in this state, the Hannya's body was moving on its own.

When she opened her eyes again, she could see herself a few feet away from the humanoid Dalki, and on the ground four of the vine-like limbs had been cut off, green blood pouring from them. It looked like the vines were also somehow linked to Helen's Dalki body, since green blood had spilt from it as well.

"Something's wrong." Helen noted, as the blood continued to drip from the vines and eventually fell on the ground as if they were no longer alive. "How are you suddenly able to cut my hard scales?! Why aren't they regrowing? What is that Cursed Sword?!"

The others who were watching, especially Vincent, were ready to jump in to join the fight. Vincent didn't care what price he would have to pay, he had lived a long life and his current body was nothing but a clone. He couldn't imagine how Quinn would feel if they would have to tell him that they had allowed Layla to die… at the hands of a Dalki version of Helen, no less, while all of them had just stayed by the side.

However, just as he started to move, he could see the sword moving in a perfect circle, and as it hit the strange Dalki vines it ripped through them one by one.

"What is that sword? Is it another Demon tier weapon?" Dennis asked, which was the question on everyone's mind who was watching the same fight. Although Layla had missed it, there was another detail of the sword that had occurred during its attack.

For a brief moment, a strange winged bat symbol had lit up. The others could only guess that it was some type of active skill the sword had used, allowing Layla to do such a thing. Even now, the strange symbol on the hilt was continuing to glow in and out.

"No, that shouldn't be the case. That black sword was a gift from Longblade, but that guy said he didn't really know where it had come from." Logan answered the question. He had only been aware that it could absorb energies, but now that he saw it display so much power, Logan was dying to inspect the weapon in detail.

Although many in the crowd were happy that Layla was finally able to do something, those close to her were concerned as she continued to wince. Unbeknownst to them, her head was bursting with cries and screams of what she could only describe as 'the damned'. They wouldn't stop in Layla's head.

'A small drawback for using me, but if you want to win this fight, then you'll have to endure this much.' The voice resonated inside her.

Her legs continued to move, but Layla wasn't the one who told them to do so. The strange energy that had inhabited her body was controlling it now. She felt in control, but at the same time not, as if someone was giving her orders of what to do, leaving her with little choice but to comply.

At that moment, seeing this, Dalki Helen stomped her foot on the ground. The whole area started to rumble before around thirty of the strange Dalki vine-like hands burst out and were moving about in the air.

"I thought as much." Vincent's eyebrows furrowed, seeing this. "She was holding back the entire time. I wonder if we had continued marching towards the fortress, if we would all be dead right now."

"You might be right in that assessment, but doesn't that warrant another question?" Logan replied. "Why would a Dalki do such a thing? She said she wanted to minimise the casualties… But then why did she want to be entertained by this fight? Shouldn't she have just gone and finished her off?"

The vine arms started to attack, all going towards Layla, but holding the black sword in her hand carefully, the Hannya looked like she was prepared for what was to come. The first vein was sliced at the top, and spinning the sword it shredded through another.

Jumping back at the right time, Layla avoided another blow, and jumped spinning backwards while using her sword to hit another three vines that came at once. As soon as she landed on the ground, she began to run forward and sliced one of the vines right down the middle and continued onward.

Opening her mouth, she blew flames everywhere, covering the area. The others could just see a shadow continuing to fight, and smoke soon after, making it hard to see where the others were.

'It's been such a long time since I was allowed to come out, and you've got such a great body, it's versatile in its skills and strengths!' The sword praised her, only to complain the next second. 'With all these prerequisites… why are you so weak? Why are you hesitating to cut her down? Why didn't you make full use of your powers?'

Jumping through the flames, for the first time, shooting out of her mouth was a black ball. It came out far faster than any of the others before. What's more, in succession, five more were shot out. Each time it hit Dalki Helen, it would unleash a chain of shadows attaching it to the ground, pinning her down.

Still, Helen was able to move through it all, yet the shadow balls continued to come, and as quickly as she was breaking it, more were being unleashed from Layla's mouth restraining the humanoid Dalki more and more.

'You shouldn't have underestimated me. I'm a sword that can cut through anything and I'm a sword that cannot break. You should have won with me alone. As long as you can keep your target still, all you have to do is cut her and you will always win.' The sword whispered to Layla.

She could feel what the sword was doing, using her subclasses' power to consume the negative emotions from within and those around, to produce the constant stream of Spiritual Chains that were keeping her opponent locked down.

Layla thought that since Dalki Helen could break them anyway, this tactic would be useless. Even if she hit Helen, the sword wouldn't pierce through her skin, but the sword had just proven her assumptions completely wrong.

Standing right in front of Dalki Helen, the sword thrust right through the Dalki's chest, twisting it in place. At the same time, the power had stopped there, and the screams had disappeared from her head. Now all she could see was the humanoid Dalki looking at her. The black colour in her eyes was fading, making her look even more human.

"Well… Layla… it looks like… you managed to win… this time. I hope… you finally confessed… to Quinn… and I hope… he is doing well… even after… what happened to… me." Helen spoke with difficulty. Right now, it didn't feel like Layla was killing a Dalki version of Helen. Hearing her speak like that, it felt like she was the real one.

"Depending on when and how the cloning process was done in the extraction. The Dalki might have all the memories of the original." Logan explained. "I saw some instances of this happening during the fight… but I was unsure. I think… this Dalki must have gained the memories for Helen a long time ago. Something that was out of expectation for Graham."

"You finally… grew up… to be… really strong… just like… I knew… you would." Dalki Helen continued, as blood still poured out from her mouth.

Tears were coming down Layla's face as she shook her head.

"No… it wasn't me." Layla admitted, tears rolling down her face. "I-I… left you back there… I should have stayed and helped you fight…I-I'm not the person you think I am."

What was making Layla feel even guiltier was the fact it hadn't been her own power that had defeated Helen. Once again she had lost, even with the use of her soul weapon.

"Don't be… stupid." Helen said, wiping away a tear from the other's face as she walked backwards, forcing the black sword out of her body. "As promised… I will… get rid… of all… the Dalki here."

Turning around, Helen looked at the base, and stomped on the ground once more. Several of the vine-like structures surrounded the base, and the next second, the humanoid Dalki had leaped up towards the fortress.

"NOOOO!" Layla screamed again, yet before she could take a single step, she collapsed onto the ground.

*****

Chapter 1539 - Her last Gift

The whole attack force was still quite a ways from the fortress, but they were able to see everything that was going on, and hear the noise that was happening inside. Not too long ago, they had seen the very Dalki Helen that they were all frightened to face with their lives, turn around and attack its own fortress.

The strange vine-like arms had all appeared in the fortress, and even now from a distance they could see Dalki being held up, their bodies pierced through and being chucked apart. A large explosion of power happened all at once as the Dalki were being destroyed. The next second, part of the fortress wall exploded and went flying, landing on the planet's surface.

Quickly, the others went to Sam, who was no longer trapped by a vine. The tactician rushed back to the others while also picking up Layla's disfigured arm. Since it was still in one piece and not too much time had passed, they should be able to reattach it with little difficulty.

Maybe even her green flames could do the job. As he returned, though, it turned out that the others were just as confused as him with what was going on. Layla was no longer in her True Hannya form. Due to all the Qi that had taken over her body, or perhaps as a drawback for staying in that form for too long, she wasn't even conscious at the moment.

"So you're telling me that Helen… I mean, the Humanoid Dalki just started to attack its own people because Layla defeated her in a duel?" Sam asked, to which he had a few people shrug their shoulders with relief on their faces.

"I think I might have some explanation for all of this." Logan chimed in. "The New Gen Dalki, I don't believe it is just referring to the humanoid Dalki we have seen, but also the three and four spikes. From the information I have gathered from the others. They didn't evolve into these spikes but were born this way.

"The humanoid Dalki are something different. Perhaps even an experiment on Graham's personal behalf. I doubt he was quite sure of the results himself, though. What has been created is something more on the lines of Borden. However, I imagine when creating such a Dalki he chose to omit memories, or perhaps even chose only selected memories.

"In a way, one could even brainwash a Dalki before they were even made to know that the humans are the enemy. However, such a process is not only very delicate and difficult, there's also no way to tell which memories have been erased and which ones might only have been suppressed. From the looks of it, Helen was a case of the latter.

"Fighting Layla might have triggered those memories in her. I'm not sure if Graham knew about that risk, or if they just cost too much to make, but I guess there's a reason why we haven't seen too many of them appear. In case something like this happened."

There was silence from the leaders that needed to make a decision on what to do next. Even now, the fight in the fortress seemed to be ongoing. However, at that moment, having received medical aid, Layla came to again.

"If she has her memories, then she's as real as the actual Helen to me… she knew about Quinn. She did all of this for us!" The young woman said, seemingly having heard everything they had talked about. She used her sword to hold herself up, still too weak to walk. "We have to at least help her to take down the fortress. No, before that, we have to heal her!"

The part about joining the attack, Sam certainly agreed with. As for helping her…

"I'm not so sure." Logan seemed against the idea. "She might look like Helen, and even have her memories, but I'm sorry, she's just a clone. We also don't know what Graham did when creating the humanoid Dalki, and without the data, we can't be sure she won't turn on us.

"When watching your fight, there seemed to be a trigger. Probably when you mentioned Quinn. Perhaps, while she is in control, this is what she has decided to do. However, can you guarantee that she won't change her mind?"

Although what Logan might have said was true, it looked like those in the Daisy faction had heard enough, and were already prepared to charge forward. The only thing was, just as they were about to, the commotion inside the fortress had come to a complete halt.

Seeing this, it looked like the group were on the move. Vincent, carried Layla on his back. While Dennis, and all those that were faster, including the vampires, ran ahead of the others. They were a little worried that the strange vines would pop out of the ground suddenly, but they never did.

When they finally reached the fortress, Vincent placed Layla down on the ground. They could see that the gates had been completely destroyed and taking a step inside it looked like everything else had as well.

The fortress had around a hundred Dalki, a mix of three and four spikes, yet none of them felt any signs of life inside. Blood splattered, holes and missing limbs of the Dalki. It had been a one-sided fight, that was for sure.

Eventually, after going through a few of the streets they had arrived at the centre, a square where the base would be used, and they could see a humanoid Dalki standing there in the centre. Her whole body, from head to toe, was bathed in green blood.

The figure looked out of sight, yet at the same time, there didn't seem to be a single mark on her apart from her chest. Eventually, Layla swivelled around to the side, and could see Helen standing there. A smile on her face. Only she might know what she had been looking at, and what her last thoughts had been… before her death.

She had died, but not before killing all the Dalki, and had died on her two feet standing.

"I didn't just kill Helen once…I killed her twice!" Layla punched the ground again and again, weeping. She couldn't stop her tears. Eventually, the rest of the Daisy faction and others entered the fortress. As they did, they all could see what Layla was crying over.

Peach went and carried Ivy over to her sister's body and placed her on the ground, and at that moment, everyone knelt down, paying their respects to the Daisy sisters.

They didn't get the chance to say their goodbyes the first time, but this time they could say goodbye to her properly. Even after death, even if this wasn't the real one. Many of their lives were saved after the Dalki attack.

Sam left the others to their goodbyes, many of the girls couldn't stop crying due to what happened, but he knew that as the leader he needed to decide on the best course of action. At the same time looking at the scene he had a thought in his head.

'A five spiked humanoid Dalki was able to take out one of these fortresses all on her own… in an injured state no less… it really is a scary thing… yet the latest report said that Graham was already a six spike...'

Entering one of the areas in the fortress that was somewhat still standing, Sam was having a meeting with the others, though Layla was unsurprisingly mentally absent.

"The fortress has been taken over, and we have managed to do so without losing our people. The Dalki no longer have any forces to rely on to support the main base. I've decided, as long as you agree to this.

"Layla, you've proven yourself as one of our strongest assets today. I don't know what happened, and you don't have to explain to me, but I think the others can do it with your help. You head over and join the Demon tier team. Take them out, destroy the Dalki main base, and get rid of any chance of them creating any monsters like this again.

"We need our strongest people to accomplish this task. I also want you to take Logan with you. He can gather information from the lab, and might be able to take it down without you guys even destroying the thing.

"As for me, Vincent, and Dennis. Us three will head back to the vampire settlement. We will get rid of the last attack force, and wherever Graham appears, we will be ready!"

Although Layla's mind was still elsewhere, she had heard everything that Sam had said. She wasn't too sure she was the right person for the job, but since their tactician deemed this to be the best, the Hannya agreed for now.

Looking at the sword, though, she could see it was no longer glowing.

'What happened back there?' Layla thought.
