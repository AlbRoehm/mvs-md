# Chapter 1520 - An Annoying God
It was a bumpy silent journey so far in the specially made travelling vehicle the group was currently in. A large reinforced vehicle that was used by top Travellers to go hunting. It was reinforced on the outside that would block most sudden attacks from beasts, but as long as they kept moving, they would be okay and mostly ignored.

On the inside, it had everything one could need. Food supplies, beds, even a kitchen area to cook in.

Travellers needed to go hunting for days on end, and with this task, in particular, none of them knew how long it was going to take.

The journey so far had been mostly silent. They were a group of strangers, and no one felt like talking, all apart from one, Rafer, who couldn't stop talking.

It was almost as if he didn't want a moment of silence to go by, so whenever no one said anything, which was a lot, he would start yapping away. There were six in total heading towards where the Demon tier beast was located or where it was hinted to be.

Nervous looks all around filled the room, apart from two who were sitting down. Erin had her arms and legs crossed, sitting opposite Bliss.

She was scowling towards the other and made sure to keep her eyebrows furrowed. It was clear she wasn't shy about hiding her disliking from the others.

"I think you're going to burn a hole through her body if you keep staring at her like that," Berg commented. "What's wrong? You've been like that ever since she was introduced to the group. Do you know her or something?"

"Not that well," Erin replied bluntly, and that was the end of Berg trying to break the ice with the only other person he knew once again. He had tried striking up a conversation with her a few times during the journey, but she had said nothing.

The ice queen still seemed like an ice queen.

The thing was, Erin was telling the truth. She really didn't know this person well, but she vividly remembered her. She was one of the few people that had turned her life upside down. In a way, ever since meeting her, that was the turning point when she started to focus on her urges.

Each time she killed a vampire, the words that the person spoke to her would come to mind, and after all that, to suddenly leave without explaining herself. Of course, Erin had a disliking for this person.

What was worse was that every time Erin gave her a look, Bliss would just smile back.

"Berg, it is now our turn," Rafer claimed, walking over to his side.

Not following what was going on, he stood up but remembered what they were meant to do and started to speak about himself.

"Hey, that's that Sunsheild kid from the big four." Connan nudged the other Traveller Brook who was next to him.

"I am from the Sunshield family, correct, and I am proud of it, but I am not proud of myself. I wasn't with the rest of the group when the Blade's came and attacked us, but I knew about them and was to keep the whole thing a secret.

"I didn't want to go into hiding, but the rest of us had to. Scared that they could still be out there. I then tried to get stronger every day, vowing to get rid of the Blade that made our family this way and then I saw the broadcast..of him getting killed.

"Now, I honestly don't know what to do, but it has led me to this place."

It was an awkward introduction, and the others didn't expect Berg to go into his back story, but it seemed like some of the comments from the others during this trip had rubbed him the wrong way.

"Okay, now Erin was it. Would you like to introduce yourself?"

Erin said nothing and just looked away. Rafer turned to the others, hoping someone else would speak, but no one did.

Since no one had volunteered or was doing so, he decided to tell everyones' skills and powers for them. He didn't know much about the others other than their name, so it was the only thing he could do. Although Erin's was completely wrong, as it looked like Rafer still believed she had some sort of speed ability.

"Okay, everyone, now that I have introduced you all to each other. I guess it's time to let someone else talk." Rafer said, who had been talking this whole time.

The next one to stand up was Bliss, who looked strange during these times with what she was wearing. She would wear long robes, which looked to have next to no armour on them. They were blue and white in colour, bright, which stood out. Then there was her weapon which was a staff.

Still, Erin of course, wouldn't let this fool her. For one time, she couldn't even move after seeing this person.

"The Demon tier beast we are about to face is strong, we are going to its location, and I have no doubt that we will beat it." After saying these words, Bliss just stopped there, smiled and sat back down.

"That's it?" Berg was now shaking even more than before. "Rafer, didn't you say she had details about the Demon tier beast or would tell us how to beat it! What is this?"

Rafer himself looked a little confused, but since he was one that didn't like confrontation much, he wanted to try and let the matter go.

"I agree. We are risking our lives here." Conan stood up. "Please tell us you have more. Otherwise, I won't support you."

"Fine," Bliss spoke again. "I can see you are all troubled, so I will tell you why the Earthborn group decided to listen to my request and why I am so confident in us beating the Demon tier beast. Because my ability is to see the future. Not just a few seconds, but accurate representations of the future.

"I already proved this fact with the leaders of the Earthborn group. So they have come to trust me."

Hearing this reminded Erin of the time the two of them met. She had said something similar to her as well.

'Honestly, this all sounds like monkey balls, and I still think she's talking cow balls right now.' Erin couldn't help but think.

"An ability to tell the future, I'm not sure I have ever heard of an ability like that. At least not like this?" Brook had his finger on his chin and was tapping away. Just like his smile, his voice was gentle as well, which didn't suit the whole look he had.

"If you really could tell the future, then you could have stopped several fights and wars by now. I don't believe it for a second." Conan crossed his arms. "Hey, why don't you tell me how I'm going to die."

"Usually, I can't tell such specific details like that, but I do have this information," Bliss replied. "But do you really wish for me to tell you that? There are many paths to the future, and perhaps me telling you your fate is the reason it is caused in the first place. Since you asked..."

It looked like Conan was somewhat regretting his actions and was about to tell her not to say anything. Now that he thought about it, knowing how he would die would be a very scary thing, but perhaps he could prevent it.

"Your death will be a cold one, a very cold one." That was all that Bliss said, and now Conan was wondering why he was even worried in the first place.

"The reason why I know we will do well on this task today in hunting the Demon tier beast, is because of her. She will be the one that we will rely on to defeat the Demon tier beast."

Looking up, Erin could see that Bliss was pointing her staff right towards her.

'Right, I really don't like this person.' Erin thought.

# Chapter 1521 - Flying Balls
"Come on, do you really expect us to believe that?" Conan asked, right after Bliss had revealed the information. "This is a Demon tier beast we are talking about, and I've never seen her in my life. What rank are you even?"

Conan was referring to her Traveller rank, the different coloured tags that they would have around their neck that would prove to others the rank they had obtained.

"I don't have a Rank. I was in the military academy long before the civil war broke out." She answered honestly, and thought there was no need to prove herself to some nobody. Still, what exactly did Bliss mean by her statement?

Was this a vision that she had actually seen, or did she just want to stir trouble.

'Does she know that I have the Demon tier weapon on me? There should only be a handful of people who know… I can't imagine that information might have leaked. However, if she does know, then I could see why she would think with me there's a good chance of subduing one. … but does that really mean she can see the future?'

"Damn it." Conan sat back down, hearing that as a reply. "We are all going to die."

Although Conan might have been the only one to audibly complain, deep down, the others that had come along in this journey felt the same way. Since the start it had sounded like a suicide squad, but they had at least hoped the military might have had a secret weapon or something. As it turns out, though, they apparently chose to trust a crazy lady.

Only a few seconds later, the outside of the vehicle started to rumble, and a loud sound had come from the left side. It was clear that they had been hit by something.

"Hey bro, did you do that?" Brook asked. "Are you a jinx or something? Just when you say we're all going to die, beasts appear?"

"Hey, now's not the time to be pointing fingers! Besides, shouldn't our psychic Bliss over here seen it coming with her powers?" The Traveller refused to take the blame for this coincidence.

While the two were arguing, Rafer was on the move, heading to the control panel, and pressing a button that would open the vehicle up. The tires stopped in place, and out from the sides the vehicle anchored itself in the ground, shooting strange devices from under the vehicle itself.

After that, a small little energy blast was sent out in all directions like a bubble around the vehicle. It was a defensive measure that would allow them to get out safely and deal with whatever the problem was.

As the back opened up, the group rushed outside to see what was going on.

Bliss was the only one who walked out casually, unfazed by that had just happened.

The first thing the group noticed as they stepped onto the black, charcoal-like ground was the fact it was hot. They could feel it on their feet, even through their beast gear. It was similar to the feeling of walking on a sandy beach with bare feet, with the sun being out. They needed to move or the pain would get to them.

This was because of the type of planet they were on. The two Shelters were placed on a levelled black ground, and most of the surrounding space was the same, but the whole planet wasn't like that. There were certain parts that were filled with molten lava from the ground below.

Even now in the distance they could see mountains of lava flowing down the side of them. In the ground itself, although not on the surface, they could see part of the ground cracked with heat waves and little embers coming out as well.

Immediately, everyone started to move due to the heat that could be felt on their feet, and they could soon see what had attacked them.

"They're…they're… balls? Floating pair of balls?" Conan, said as for some reason, when lifting his crossbow, he was hesitant to shoot at it. The beast looked like two giant balls stuck together floating in the air, and he felt like if he were to hit such a thing, he would begin to feel pain in a certain area.

Soon, though, they turned towards him, and a single large eyeball could be seen, on each of the balls.

"Ahh, it's hideous!" Conan shouted and immediately shot out an arrow from his crossbow, hitting it square in the eye. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to kill the beast. The next moment, the strange tentacles that were attached around the balls started to fire out fireballs towards him in a rage.

He managed to avoid most of them with ease, but soon more attacks were coming towards him from the others. The beasts had surrounded the vehicle, and there looked to be around thirty or so of them.

Conan would roll on the ground, and fire at those closest to him. He proved that his crossbow was a mighty weapon. While he didn't manage to hit each beast in their eye, they would still get pushed back a few feet, giving him time and distance to fire at another one.

Brook had taken out the two sickles, and hopped from side to side, not allowing any of the flames to touch him. He had attempted to strike the ball from below, but the balls would just spin along with the hit, trying to minimise the damage. So instead, Brook decided to cut off the tentacles that were firing the balls of fire in the first place.

Finally, there were the other three, Berg didn't have any problems, when the flames hit his body they did next to no harm. If he timed it right, he could even hit the flames back at the beast that would even hurt them when being hit.

There was Bliss who even though stood still not a single one of the flames were hitting her. Finally, there was Erin. Who hadn't used her Demon tier blade, though she was showing off with her blood weapon.

The Dhampir pretended to struggle against one of the beasts at first, before bisecting it so fast that it had no time to react. She had expected to see blood, yet there was something else inside. Its insides were glowing, not just that, but the energy was getting larger by the second. An explosion went off.

The bang was heard and had destroyed part of the ground Erin had stood on, but when the smoke settled she looked to be fine. Using the second stage of Qi she had learned she managed to shield herself from this explosive attack, but this was certainly a strange thing.

And that's when all of them could see, since they were unable to kill the humans in front of them. The floating pair of balls started to shake violently. They then started to glow, and it looked like all twenty of them had decided to self-destruct.

"Everyone, gather around me." Bliss called out.

She had been drawing a large circle with her staff on the ground. The others listened and got inside, including Rafer who had been observing how well the others were doing. Mainly just using a beast shield to stop the flames.

When they got inside, explosion after explosion went off one after another, and no one could see a thing, but they realised that none of them felt pain. Bliss' staff was lit up, and she had created a barrier that had protected them all from the attack.

Now there were no more beasts on site, and at least the vehicle they had arrived in looked to be okay as well.

"Phew, that was a close one, I guess I should be thanking you." Conan said, as he was constantly hoping on the spot to make sure his feet didn't get too hot. Brock and Rafer were doing the same, but for the others the same couldn't be said.

Conan gave them a look as to wonder why they didn't feel the same way. Berg, he could understand.

"It's an active ability of my armour equipment, I knew what type of place we were going to after all." Bliss explained, seemingly having read his mind.

Since they were safe, Erin already started to head back to the vehicle to get a move on. In her case, the reason she was fine was due to the Demon tier weapon. Just being next to it was giving off this cooling effect on her body. It was the perfect counter to this type of environment.

When getting back on the vehicle, Rafer had made the decision that they would camp for the day. The military officer drove the vehicle to a safer area… One that was away from the heated spots of land, and was at the foot of a mountain that wasn't spewing lava.

He asked Bliss if it was okay, though she just gave him a smile and nodded. The vehicle had beds on the other end and were stacked on top of each other like a large bunk bed. Erin was sleeping on the bottom bunk and on the other side was Bliss. However, before both women went to sleep the Dhampir had decided to approach the God.

"It's clear you're not normal." Erin said. "I don't understand it, but I can tell you're special. I also have a feeling you're not actually lying, which is why I'm asking you. No, I'm begging you. Tell me, is there a way to stop the future that you saw from happening? Is there a way to stop what is happening to me?"

*****

# Chapter 1522 - Come To Our Table
Before asking the question, Erin made sure that the others were busy. No one seemed to be paying them any attention, and Rafel was the first one on guard duty as he looked outside the vehicle's window while keeping an eye on the radar equipment.

The group would take turns during the night so all of them would get some type of shut-eye.

The worst thing that could happen was if a Demon tier beast suddenly attacked them in the middle of the night. Just in case, though, seeing how careful Erin was being, she stood up and walked towards the back of the vehicle to a small table where the kitchen cooking area would be.

Berg noticed this but decided to ignore it and close his eyes.

'For two people who don't like each other, they sure do talk a lot.'

By the next second, he was asleep. It was his talent to sleep within seconds no matter what time of day it was or worry he had in his mind.

"I can't help but notice that you're worried about my earlier words." Bliss started the conversation.

"I remember every single word," Erin replied as she clenched her fist. "Heed my warning, as two sides that didn't know of each other come together to defeat an enemy the other created, the whole world will learn about them.

"At that moment, something will break the trust and bond between those two, and a new chaos will destroy the other. You will become that Chaos. Those were your exact words."

Erin hadn't made a single mistake when repeating back what Bliss had once said because, since that day, she had been repeating the phrase over and over again.

"Two sides that come together to defeat an enemy the other created. It looks like this part has already come true. You must know that the vampires were the ones that created the Dalki. And now the humans and the vampires have come together.

"Since your first prediction turned out to be true, I'm now worried about the second part. You said I would be the chaos that destroys the other… it's the vampires. I have the urge to kill vampires, and that's what you meant."

She stopped there, waiting for Bliss's response. It took a moment before the latter eventually replied.

"I don't know if that's the case, Erin. The future has changed, and I do things to prevent the future. However, don't you think there is a middle section that you have skipped over to some degree?

"The Dalki have yet to fall. Perhaps you trying to change your fate will even change this part, but who knows? What I can say is this... I don't have an answer for you, but I have knowledge that might help you find your answer.

"The vampires are beings created by a god who resides on the other side. Now you might think I'm crazy saying all of this, but hear me out till the end, and then you can make up your own mind. You, yourself, were created from a vampire, yet you have the urge to kill those who created you.

"You can bypass the laws and powers that were set by those beings and gods that created you. Your existence is nothing less than a miracle, and that is why the vampires are so scared of your kind. And because of this, even the God that created vampires will be after you.

"To God, you're an existence that must be hunted down because you have the power to rise to his position or to even rise above him. You have the potential to go beyond a vampire and reach his level. If you try to fight what you are and what you have become, you will lose your life.

"But maybe you shouldn't be fighting it, perhaps to overcome it, you need to accept it. If you don't, then it also means that you will never reach that place, and you will be running for the rest of your life.

"I would suggest, even though I shouldn't, that you should strive to become a power. I want you at our table, and I assure you, you will be alright."

Bliss stood up there with nothing else to say, but it didn't seem like she was running away this time, and her words had left Erin with a lot to think about.

As time went on, Berg woke up. It was dark outside, and he was rubbing his eyes. He took a peek below him and noticed that Erin still wasn't in his bed.

'Don't tell me she is…' Berg thought, looking over in the direction where he had last seen her before she had gone to sleep. There he could still see her on the sofa, not having moved.

'I wonder if she fell asleep; oh well, not my problem.' Berg thought, closing his eyes again, and a few seconds later, loud snores buzzed from him.

Sometime later, Berg started to wake up, but it was because he could hear sound creaking from above. He imagined that it was due to another going on watch duty. Turning to his side, he decided to ignore it. As for the person above him, it was none other than Conan.

Walking on the floor, he was making his way towards Erin.

'I could feel it from before.' Conan thought as he walked towards her. 'There is a chill whenever I'm next to her. At first, I thought it was coming from her, but then I realised it was from whatever she had wrapped up.'

The huge sword usually left on Erin's back was currently on the sofa next to her, leaning against the sofa.

'A weapon that's able to sustain the user in a heat like this. It has to be of a high tier level.' He thought as his temptation had reached the better of him.

Turning over again, Berg opened his eyes, wondering if Erin was still there, and that's when he saw Conan's hand reaching out, attempting to seize the sword.

"What are you doing?!" Berg cried.

Hearing this, Conan jolted forward and grabbed onto the cloth material; simultaneously, Erin turned her head. She had fallen asleep at some point.

"AGHHHH!" Conan started to scream in shock and confusion upon noticing what was happening to him. The scream had woken up everyone in the vehicle, and when they moved to see what was happening, they saw ice that was slowly spreading up to his arm and was freezing his entire body. It took a few seconds, and when the ice encased his whole body, it shattered into hundreds of small pieces.

"I told him his death would be cold," Bliss grunted, looking at shattered ice, which was Conan a few seconds ago, "It seems your sword did not find him worthy. Your weapon is a picky one. Take pride in that."

'My weapon Did that?' Erin was still in a stupor, but what else could it have been. Without a doubt, it was the weapon's potent freezing powers.

Erin claimed that she wasn't the one who acted against Conan. Luckily due to Bliss's prophecy from before and Berg as a witness, the others didn't need much convincing about the whole thing.

It was clear that he was the cause of his own death. However, it also meant that Erin now could no longer hide things. She took off the cloth from the large blade, and now Rafer immediately recognised its shape in its sheath. It was the Demon tier weapon that Oscar had once carried, and now it was in the hands of Erin.

"I can assure you; I didn't steal this... it was given to me. You can confirm with Samantha if you want." Erin said.

"No worries here; besides, now I understand why we have a chance of beating this Demon tier beast."

With the Demon tier beast in her hand and the words from Bliss yesterday, the group was now confident to go out and hunt for another Demon tier beast.

*****

# Chapter 1523 - Two Demons

The situation looked dire for the main Graylash family. From the initial large strong attack force, only a few were left alive, whereas there was still a third of the enemy side left. However, Owen did still have one trump card up his sleeve.

'The humanoid Dalki… it's strong. Nicu might be a loudmouth, but he is not a weak Vampire, yet it only has a few scratches of blood. It would be a mistake to regard these New Gen four spikes on the same level as the older ones.' Owen thought. 'I just hope Grandfather and the other groups are okay….'

Just when they were on their last legs, that was when Nate had noticed a fierce blonde beauty running from the side. Swinging her sword, a tunnel of ice came down. It froze a few of the Dalki, and with large slashes of yellow aura and strength in every swing, she had managed to kill three of the humanoid Dalki without breaking a sweat.

"Who is that?" One of the surviving vampires of the first family questioned. They could smell that Erin was somewhat similar to a vampire but didn't recognise her appearance. They also had no idea who it was from the looks. That was until her hair started to change colour, turning from a blonde into black, and her eyes began to glow.

It was a trait of a Dhampir, when next to other vampires, for their hair colour to change. Although Erin had learned how to control it, that required her concentration, and in the midst of battle, she couldn't afford to lose focus.

"Everyone, this is our only chance. Whatever second wind you have in you…we have to attack now!" Nate shouted at the top of his lungs and was ready to with his shield.

Nate knew some of the abilities that the Demon tier sword held. He also knew that there was a cooldown after using the first skill, the second one was practically useless in this situation, which was why he had decided they had to act now.

Since Erin had made such a grand entrance, the four and three spikes had turned their head towards her. This gave a chance for the vampires, Nate and Nicu, to go out on the attack. Five vampires, all wielding swords similar to Nicu, had charged in together. They were aiming to take out whatever Dalki they faced as quickly as possible.

A slash in one's stomach, Nicu then twisted the hilt of the sword and infused his blood powers, making a large hole. Before the Dalki could act, the other five of Nicu's men leaped and stabbed it with their swords, into the Dalki's arms.

Grabbing his hilt, Nicu used all his strength and blood aura to pull the sword up, slicing the Dalki's head in half from his stomach and finishing it in one spot.

Now, he could see the Humanoid Dalki that hadn't gone towards Erin, the one that had given him so much trouble from before.

"You!" Nicu pointed his sword towards him. The humanoid Dalki looked towards them and smiled, seemingly accepting the challenge to go for another round.

As he charged towards the first family leader, its legs grew in size, mainly around the thigh area. They were now larger than his torso, and his former speed seemed as if had just been warming up. However, before it could reach Nicu, a flash of lightning came down, striking directly at the top of the Dalki's head.

It hit perfectly just behind his neck, and a metal fan was seen digging deep into the Dalki, crashing it into the ground. Soon, Nicu could see Owen standing there.

"I have to deal with this…I have failed my family, allowing too many of them to die. This one is mine." Owen declared.

He held his metallic fan and pulled it apart with his bare hands, split into around twelve different metallic pieces. His fingers were still electrified and the current was passed through from one hand, going through each part of the fans to the other, making them stay in place.

Swinging his arms downward, the fan pieces split out, and hit the ground, making a circle around him and the Dalki. They started to glow blue and an electric current passed through each of them.

Now, around the Dalki was an makeshift arena spread to look like an electric fence.

"I know you can probably just storm out of this place, but you Dalki are warriors, you should have some pride, so let's just make this a fight between the two of us."

In the meantime, a little away in the massive crater. Erin could see a group of four Dalki charging towards her. She gripped onto the handle tightly as she thought back to that time.

——

The entire group were sweating and panting after having defeated such a colossal monster. Its body laid there in the background. Ice tunnels everywhere and ice all around. Rafer had been injured quite badly, yet he was still alive, and the others didn't look much better than him.

Bliss was currently the only one that wasn't out of breath. She had created a safe area for all of them, so their wounds wouldn't worsen by the surrounding heat.

"You want to know where to go next, don't you?" Bliss asked, looking at Erin. "Take the crystal, and use it to strengthen your powers. They will need you in this war."

——

Thinking back and seeing the Dalki run towards her, Erin twisted the hilt of her large sword, and something strange happened. The colour of her blade started to change slowly, going from a white and blue metallic shine, turning red.

The edges on both sides and the inner rings all started to glow red at the same time, and a strong heat was emptying from the sword.

Pointing it towards the Dalki, in front of her, one of the rings on the sword was activated, showing the first active skill was being used again. The next moment a large tunnel of fire appeared on the battlefield. It hit the Dalki straight on, and just like with the ice, anything that touched the tunnel of fire, would soon be covered in flames.

Nate, who was coming in to help, couldn't believe it. The Dalki's strong hide resisted flames, yet the power of the demon tier weapon was melting them in front of him.

'Since when..could Oscar's weapon do that?' Nate wondered.

This wasn't an active skill of Oscar's weapon. This was the power of the other Demon tier weapon that Erin had gotten her hands on. After being told what planet to go to, and what to do, Erin had taken the beast crystal.

The others wanted to complain, but they really couldn't. It was undeniable that her contribution had been paramount to obtaining the crystal. Besides, who could stop her in the first place? Searching far and wide, she had eventually found someone who could do something with the Demon tier crystal.

It wasn't a humanoid one like her current one, so she thought it would be weaker. However, the forger was inexperienced, and the best he could make out of the crystal was an attachment, for her sword. It was one that would go onto the hilt for better grip.

When she had come to pick up what she had assumed to be another weapon, or at least a piece of armor, only to see that, Erin had almost killed the forger. Fortunately for him, he had been quick enough to tell her to try it out. She had tried to figure out what effects the hilt had.

After testing, these were the results. Every single effect that the sword had, and its active skills, had been altered slightly. Instead of ice, she could use the power of flames. The power wasn't lacking, either.

Twisting the hilt of the sword again, a click would be heard, and the sword would go back to how it once was. The cooldown for the active skills on the weapon were separate as well. Allowing her to use six different active skills on her sword. Now she wielded the power of flames, and ice on her weapon.

She ran forward towards the incoming Dalki, and slashed one of its arms. A yellow aura covered the blade, and a trail of flames were left behind as she swung down, cutting the arm. She was fast, and slashed again, killing the Dalki in front of her. Soon another one was approaching, and twisting the hilt, the blade changed.

She stabbed the ground, and a trail of ice started to leave the ground and had reached the Dalki freezing its feet. It was strong enough to break free, but it had slowed it down just in time. Not only had Erin gotten strength from the skill, her Dhampir powers had grown, and she now had the stats of two Demon tier weapons she was untouchable.

Back in the fight with Owen and the humanoid Dalki, the two looked at each other, and the Graylash family leader was taunting the man, and he gathered a pure lightning bolt of power, holding it in his hand from the centre like it was some spear.

The Dalki didn't stop smiling, circling around the arena, and eventually charged forward. It was even faster than before, and rocks were chucked up from the ground itself. It readied its fist.

"With this power, I feel like I could destroy the whole planet!" The humanoid Dalki said, believing nothing could survive its punch.

"Have you tried destroying a shell, though?" Owen smiled.

The marking on his hand started to glow.

*****

# Chapter 1524 - Unbreakable Shell
Since Erin could deal with whatever was coming her way and Nicu had his five bodyguards fighting alongside him, killing the Dalki relatively quickly, Nate decided to make himself useful in other ways.

He ran through the crater and, using his senses, tried to see if anyone was still alive on the battlefield. He was sure that there would be some at least. Although it seemed everyone had fallen after the fight, the Dalki didn't have time to check and make sure each one was dead.

As Nate was going through the large crater that had become a battlefield, he saw devastating aftermaths and his hopes weren't high. There were bodies everywhere, with torn limbs, and most of them were crushed by just a simple step of the Dalki.

He could even see armour that Dalki had ripped apart along with limbs.

'This fight…it wasn't a fight they could have won. The Dalki are too strong for this lot.'

Although Nate didn't want to admit something, even though the large army of around a hundred thousand couldn't do much, they were a big distraction for the Dalki, which was one of the reasons they were allowed to live.

Nate's Demon tier shield was strong, so strong that he was confident in battling with most Dalki, and even against a five spike, he had a chance as long as they didn't know what the shield did, of course. The battle becomes more unpredictable once the enemy learns of the shield's active skill.

Still, when fighting multiple, the shield wasn't the best, Nate could make up for this with his shadow powers, but against four spikes, his shadow powers were at best able to block a couple of hits.

'The shadow power appeared strong at first…but that's mainly because people have only seen Quinn use it against overwhelming strength. It just isn't that useful.'

Finally, Nate detected a heartbeat. He immediately rushed towards the pile of bodies, started to shuffle through them, and pulled bodies off one by one, eventually pulling out someone who mainly looked fine.

"What…is going on? I couldn't breathe. They were so heavy." The young man said while trying to catch a breath.

"What happened?" Nate replied. "The fight is still going on. They're too strong, but we can still do our part. Come on, help me look for other survivors... this war, as many as possible have to come back from it.'

Thinking back to what Sam had said, the Dalki had prepared nine-strong forces in their part of the solar system to counter the strong forces that the humans and vampires had in this war. As long as they had won this fight, they would have won one of the grand battles that were to take place.

However, there was still the Dalki mothership and the Dragon to go after, and on top of that, one of the forces on their side had pretty much already suffered a defeat due to One Horn.

Looking towards Owen, Nate was cheering him on inwardly.

At that moment, the humanoid Dalki charged forward with its fist clenched. Its super-speed amplified his natural strength to the max. There weren't many things that it would be unable to break if this fist hit them.

But Owen could perhaps think of one thing.

"Don't let me down," Owen muttered as the lightning bolt mark on his hand lit up. The next second, and a large shell had appeared, only a little bigger than Owen himself.

"The legendary Genbu has appeared!" The familiar shouted, looking towards Owen while its back faced the Dalki.

Not worried, the Dalki slammed whatever was in front of it with its fist. A magnifying bang was heard, and a shockwave was sent outward. The others could feel the air's vibrations from such a mighty clash.

Yet, when the Dalki looked at the shell, there wasn't a single crack on it.

"This thing is a lot stronger than those shells I have already shredded," Genbu claimed. "Is this why you needed me? To stop weak attacks like this? I was worried that you might need me to stop others like that other kid."

"No." Owen smiled. "That guy is one of a kind, and our current opponent is someone else."

Owen leapt onto Genbu's shoulders as the turtle stood upright like a human. Honestly, Owen was surprised that Genbu hadn't even moved an inch, but it meant that what he had claimed was true.

While Genbu and Owen had been together, he had asked what exactly he could do, other than having a solid shell and changing his size. The truth was, Genbu was actually a giant in size. His large figure was his true size, but his weight was still the same no matter how small he got and transformed his form down.

The familiar could use this power to its advantage. With his added strength and ability, one would need the power to move mountains to move him.

Owen held the pure lightning Bolt as he saw the Dalki's fist was still on the shell as if he was frozen in disbelief that something was able to block it. Owen aimed to kill, throwing the pure lighting bolt down towards the Dalki's head.

But the Dalki snapped out of the daze and moved his head to the side, avoiding the strike, and the lightning bolt hit nothing but the ground.

"This shell may stop my attacks, but you still can't kill-" Before the Dalki could finish its sentence, he saw the very same pure lightning bolt that Owen had thrown seconds ago in his hands.

Around it, there was green blood which was now slowly evaporating. The Dalki noticed that there was now a hole through its stomach when looking down.

The lightning bolt was able to be attracted back to Owen even after hitting the ground.

"I can't let you die so easily, and I realised I was wrong in my assessment before," Owen stated as he gathered all his lightning powers in his other hand. The lighting continued to spread up to his shoulders as it burnt his sleeves, revealing his muscular arms underneath.

With both of his hands covered in lightning, Owen shouted, "Genbu, now!"

The next second, the turtle grew in size; it was happening quickly, growing so big it was already half the size of the entire crater. It then jumped on its feet, and it looked like it was ready to crush the Dalki.

Seeing this, the Dalki was afraid that perhaps Genbu's sheer weight would kill him along with others in the crater; it was madness. Using his legs, the Dalki tried to run out of the crater, towards the fortress, as fast as he could, but just as quickly as Genbu grew, he suddenly shrank in size and headed right towards the Dalki.

"Thank you, I needed you to get away from the others," Owen smirked at the Dalki.

Genbu, now as large as a house, landed right on top of the Dalki, flattening it on the spot, and continued to shrink until he suppressed the Dalki lying just on his back legs.

Then Owen jumped off Genbu and landed in front of the Dalki. Genbu's weight must have been immense if the four spiked Dalki could not lift it off its legs even with its power; in fact, he felt as if his legs were most likely crushed.

The Dalki was punching the ground, creating deeper craters underneath it until the pure lighting bolt stabbed it right through its hand.

"Stop this," Owen shouted, stabbing the Dalki with the bolt again. He didn't do this just once, but several times, stabbing the Dalki's hand, again and again, each time creating a hole in his body. Owen wanted the Dalki to be incapable of moving his hands, and the power of Qi strengthened the lightning bolts.

"I was wrong about you…you weren't as strong as a five spike, but those that you brought with yourself were also strong," Owen said, as he finally threw one last lightning spike directly at the humanoid Dalki, finishing it off and at the same time he himself fell to his knees.

"Genbu…my vision is so blurry…I think... this might be it for… for me.." Owen said, clasping onto the floor.

# Chapter 1525 - Who I Am
A search through a vast battlefield, through endless corpses, would have perhaps taken weeks, and maybe even longer with just a single person, but with Nate's vampire senses, he could hear any heartbeat among them; in other words, there wasn't the need for him to check each one individually.

Still, the stench of the blood was even getting to his nose now that he was no longer fighting. He had to make sure to hold himself back.

Originally, he had planned to make it so the survivors would help him on his search to make it easier for him to search. After all, there were bound to be a few who would be close to death or need emergency medical care.

He had already sent one of the survivors, who was in good condition, to head back to the ship, to grab some medical supplies, and return as soon as possible, but the rest of the survivors he had found were unwilling to leave his side.

They were still scared since the fight was ongoing and wanted to stay by Nate's side. He was one of the few people who survived the fight and they knew he was strong enough to take these monsters on.

Eventually, Nate managed to rescue a group of around fifteen almost unscathed people. Some of them had even been pretending to have been injured or hurt, hiding amongst the dead.

"You bastard! How could you, my friend, sacrificed himself while you, you-!" One of the men shouted and grabbed the other by the scruff of his uniform.

"Stop!" Nate shouted. "Of all times, now is definitely not the time to fight amongst ourselves."

Continuing their search, they even found a few who had a few limbs missing. Still, they did their best to do what they could and even cleared an area for the injured outside of the large crater, placing them gently on the ground and waiting for help to arrive.

Using the strength of the beast shield, Nate still had great strength along with his vampire powers to move things quickly, and once in a while, he would consume the blood of the Dalki to re energise himself.

Right now, the group of people had just placed their tenth injured but alive, soldiers down in a cleared area.

"Commander Nate." The first young man Nate had found, named Jerry, spoke. "Do you think we can really win this war…for me, right now, it seems somewhat impossible. We aren't even on their main planet or base, and there were only a hundred of them.

"I might look young...but I was also there during the first war, and I believe you were too young to take part. This fight, as to how we were so easily overpowered and could do nothing but watch helplessly as our abilities turned out ineffective against our enemy, felt a lot like the old war."

Nate understood what must have been going through his mind because he also had the same thoughts.

"I think the same way," Nate replied honestly. "However, there are times when I see people that make me think the opposite. Look at that." Nate turned back to the fighting field.

They were on the rim of the giant crater, and down below, they could see that the fight was still going on. It was Erin, who hadn't given up, and just blocked an attack with her long blade, stabbing it into the ground.

She soon pulled out her small blood blade and her chains as she continued to go through movements, pulling Dalki and smashing them into each other while slicing them with faster speed. She took out one quickly and hurried back to her large sword in the ground.

She kicked the sword handle so hard that it broke out of the ground and flipped into the air. Then grabbing it midway with both hands, she swung it with flames cutting it in half.

It was like watching a fiercely skilful and mighty warrior take out the Dalki one by one. It wasn't like Quinn who would overpower them... this fight gave a different feeling. And to the eyes of the humans and the others, what Erin was doing right now seemed achievable.

While watching the fight, they suddenly saw a large shadow being cast over the large crater. That was because Genbu had just grown in size, but the shadow quickly went away as he started to shrink.

A few minutes after watching everything, the group realised something as they looked below.

"The fighting has stopped…there are no more Dalki! We've won…we Won!" Jerry was the first to react, and soon the rest of the survivors screamed on top of their lungs and fell to their knees. It was a relief, as they felt something beyond the joy as they realised that they had managed to survive this war.

——

Back on the ground, Genbu was still out in his human-sized form, and Owen was lying there flat on the ground, not moving for a second.

"Ha…you are weak…but you are strong enough for me. Don't worry; you are not dead. If you were, then I still wouldn't be here." Genbu muttered.

With no danger around, Genbu started to disappear, and the purple bolt tattoo appeared back on Owen's hand.

Noticing that the battle had concluded, the group began to run down the crater to check on Owen and the others.

Nicu moved swiftly. Most of the vampires in the group were now dead, leaving only him with three others who were equally as hurt and bleeding with him.

"I can't believe those damn lizards were so strong, but it didn't help that everyone else died so quickly," Nicu said, still huffing and panting.

What he was even more amazed at, though, was Erin. She had come in such a short time and had taken out the majority of the twenty-five or so Dalki who were left, killing nearly twelve of them. Not only that, she had done it all on her own as well.

"Sir, do you wish for us to gather the vampires and make a report back to the settlement?" One of the vampires asked while kneeling on a knee, still in pain.

"We should perhaps gather our fallen. They have fought side by side with us. Then we will send them to the settlement for a proper burial, but this is not a loss." Nicu said as he looked around and noticed Owen was on the floor, having defeated the new Gen Dalki.

"This is a win for us…no, it is a win for the vampire and human race!" Nicu exclaimed with a smile.

Nicu had been stubborn. He had a distaste for humans, but where had that come from? It was mostly from his father's teachings and feelings that had somewhat passed onto him, but was that how he truly felt?

From the small interactions with them all, he felt that the humans weren't bad. Seeing Owen defeat an enemy that he could not, Nicu had nothing but respect for the former.

"Perhaps someday…the vampires and humans can work together."

Turning his head around away from Owen, he soon saw a flash of red blood appear in front of his eyes. It was sudden, and Nicu had no clue what was going on, but when the blood fell, he saw that all three of his men were dead and a sword covered in blood.

It was the girl from earlier, and her eyes were fierce yellow as she walked over towards him.

"A Dhampir!" Nicu shouted as he opened his mouth and bared his fangs towards the woman. He tried to get his sword but could barely move his hand, and before he could do anything, he suddenly lost his vision as his head bounced on the ground.

Nate and the others, who were a little away but close enough to witness everything, stood frozen in shock.

"ERIN!!! WHAT THE F*CK ARE YOU DOING!" Nate shouted at the top of his lungs and lifted his shield, ready to protect all those around him.

She then turned around and smiled at them all with a tear running down her face.

"I'm sorry, this is just who I am…. I have to go."

*****

# Chapter 1526 - War Crime
The first leader's body fell on the surface without a head. The young Nicu hadn't been the leader for the first family for long, and he was a youngling compared to the others. In fact, other than ones whom Bryce had turned long ago, Nicu was the last child and end of the first family bloodline from Bryce.

The thing was, for the people who had witnessed this sudden turn of event, none of them knew how much of a big deal this truly was. That was because none of them were officially a part of the settlement. Nate, who was also a vampire, wasn't involved in that world.

"She killed one of the vampire leaders, who was helping us…is she going to come after us," Jerry said in a worried tone as his sword shook in his hands. Just seconds ago, he was about to praise this woman for her beautiful skills in combat and for helping them defeat the Dalki, and now he was scared by her for his life.

After Erin had spoken her words, she had a pained look on her face as she stared at Nate, and after a moment, she turned around and ran away.

"Hey...should we go after her?" One of the men asked, unsure if it was a good idea. However, even if they wanted to chase her, she was far too fast and was already too far for them to catch up.

"No...we can't defeat her anyway." Nate answered and glanced at the sliced corpses of Dalki not far away from them.

Although Nate had initially disliked Nicu for his noble attitude and his view that vampires were better than humans.

But at the end of the day, not just in vampire terms but even in human years, Nicu was just a child; thus, Nate disregarded the former's thoughts as childish.

However, a part of Nicu wasn't childish at all, and that was when fighting by their side. Not for a second did he waiver and always went head-on to face whatever was thrown at them. He had done things that other vampires and humans would have hesitated to do.

The vehicle from the main ship had returned, and for now, Nicu's body and his head were carefully placed in it, and with all of the survivors, they headed back to the ship. They would then bring the ship back and store the dead in a special place. Thankfully there were mechs on board and special equipment; thus, the few survivors could manage all this.

In the meantime, Nate stayed at Owen's side, where he had fought the Dalki; he was on the surface sleeping peacefully despite it being hard and rough. And Nate just sat there thinking about everything and resting, waiting for Owen to wake up eventually.

After some time, Owen slowly opened his eyes. He was half expecting to see clouds, but he could see the same dull ground-like substance, and not too far from him was the humanoid Dalki he had defeated.

"You're finally awake," Nate said.

"Oh…and the blockhead is still alive," Owen replied, trying to move his muscles, but he could barely move them. No matter how much he tried, it felt like his body was stuck on the ground. He was exhausted and would need some time to recover.

"Do you remember the mediation technique I showed you? It would be best to work on that and slowly try to recover your Qi. You used it all up, nearly surpassed your limits, and were going into your real-life energy. If you meditate for a while, eventually, it will speed up your recovery." Nate suggested.

Owen followed his advice, and after around fifteen minutes of meditation, he had gathered enough energy to slowly move his body and sit up in a better position.

Still, he knew that it would take a while for him to get back to fighting condition again.

"We lost a lot, didn't we," Owen said while still sitting in a cross-legged position and meditating.

"We actually lost more than you think…the vamp kid..is dead." Nate held his head in shame. Since he had survived, he now felt like he perhaps could have done something. Maybe if he even stayed and helped Nicu fight. He was sure that Erin, having at least known her somewhat, wouldn't have attacked him.

Honestly, though, Nate still had no clue what happened, why Erin had done such a thing, and if she was killing the vampires, why hadn't she killed him as well. In the end, Nate explained what happened to Owen, how Erin was the one that killed Nicu.

Perhaps it was something he should have hidden from the Graylash leader until the current situation settled down, but he was now frustrated with Erin. Having committed such a war crime, Erin wasn't an ally anymore.

"That is a crazy story." Owen finally replied. "I am just as at a loss as you are. However, although I agree she had done a bad thing, and I would not be kind to her in any way after killing someone I fought side-by-side with, I wonder if we could have survived if she hadn't interfered at the time.

"Sure, I was able to defeat the humanoid Dalki, but I collapsed shortly after, and we were truly on our last legs at the time. Still…I was starting to like that young vampire." Owen smiled and started to think back to the little playful competitions the two of them had during their time in this mission.

Eventually, the ship arrived near the crater. It landed at a short distance from the Dalki fortress. Soon, the survivors began to gather their fallen comrades and place them inside.

"I'm scared." Nate eventually said. "Based on what happened, I should have called Sam and updated him on what is going on, but now I'm scared to hear news of what has happened to the other planets. We had you, one of the previous big four, a demon tier weapon, a vampire leader, and even Erin, who had a demon tier weapon, to eventually win this fight.

"The other groups, some of them don't even have half as much power as we had, and our whole force was wiped out. What if we are the only ones to win the battle…what if... everyone is already dead?"

Of course, Owen understood Nate's feelings well, especially after looking at the devastation the new Gen Dalki had caused. At the same time, there wasn't even a five spike among them, nor was their leader Graham.

"I need to know what happened to my Grandfather." Owen eventually said. "He is strong, but as you said, even with the leaders helping him, I imagine the forces he has run into are troublesome. If he needs help…I will have to go and support him."

Sam had told them not to do this, but even Nate couldn't go against Owen when the latter's family was involved. The plan was to continue from this planet and search for the Dalki home base. Those that succeeded in taking over one of the nine Dalki planets were tasked with this job.

"I will continue to search for the Dalki base," Nate answered. "You should go see your grandfather, but before that, let's make a call."

On the receiver, Nate was trying to get through to Sam on the other end, hoping to hear an answer to everything. It rang for a while with no response, but of course, connections across different planets would take a while anyway.

Still, it made him more nervous until he had finally heard a voice.

"This is Sam. Nate, have you contacted me to make a report?" Sam asked.

Hearing his voice was a relief for Nate.

"Yeah, we are done on our end. Are you in a suitable position for me to tell you all the details, or would you like me to write a report for you to look at?"

There was a pause for a while until Sam eventually replied again.

"It's alright; you can tell me everything that has happened so far. We have landed on the Dalki planet and have discovered the new Gen Dalki. However, we have yet to engage; we were in the middle of deciding what to do as we got the reports of everyone else."

"Please." Owen suddenly interrupted, "Can you ask them if they got a report from Grim?" He asked.

Nate relayed the question over, to which Sam replied.

"Yes, I have received a report from two groups, one of them being from Grim, and the other from Sunny…I have some bad news."

*****

# Chapter 1527 - Unexpected Help
Usually, Owen was a calm leader who could handle nearly any situation. He knew that it was always best to remain level-headed when making decisions and during combat, but lately, he had been losing calmness.

Right now, he could hear his heart thumping as he awaited the news from Sam. It didn't help that Sam had already stated that the news was a bad one.

"I suppose Owen is with you; I will inform you about the other Graylash group first. Three-quarters of their forces were wiped out. They had claimed they went against multiple three to four spike Dalki, and there were even a couple of ones that appeared to be more human." Sam explained.

The situation seemed to be similar to there's, if not worse. They had only fought against one humanoid Dalki. Hearing this, Owen didn't have much hope if it wasn't for what he said initially.

"Three-quarters of their forces were wiped out?" Owen repeated, now joining in on the same call as Nate.

"Yes, although a lot of lives were lost, the second Graylash group managed to achieve victory because they had some unexpected help come their way."

———

The second Graylash family was on the move. The planet was located somewhat close to the sun, and its ozone was very thin, allowing a lot of the heat to pass through, making the planet quite hot. For a large force that wasn't used to fighting in these types of conditions, they were already struggling.

When going up against the New Gen, the group faced a mammoth task that was more challenging than they could have ever thought. Thankfully though, Grim had trusted his gut somewhat. The Graylash Family's old ex-leader had a gut feeling that something terrible was about to happen, and they couldn't take on the enemy as they had done on the other planets.

He had rearranged the group into separate forces based on the abilities, rather than having small teams like they usually would support each other. Grim had a feeling that individual strength and individual groups wouldn't be able to deal with the threat, and they needed to unite their numbers and powers.

On top of this, by noticing the enemy before they reached the place, they had fared quite well against the Dalki, far better than Owen had done, who were unprepared when seeing the fortress in front of them.

Still, the strength of the Dalki was tremendous, and while Grim was busy dealing with a humanoid Dalki who looked like it had giant balloons on its shoulders, the other humanoid Dalki was wrecking the remaining force.

Hermes, who was also travelling with Grim, had tried to fight off the other Humanoid Dalki; this one had longer limbs than usual. Its arms were almost twice the size and had double elbow joints.

It allowed the Dalki to kill a mass amount of people at once. Unfortunately, facing a four spike creature with such a unique trait was the end of Hermes's life.

Old man Grim was at a loss of what to do. He knew that they would be unable to win, but if they were to retreat, it would do them no better, and they were more likely to lose their own lives.

That was until an unexpected ship was seen approaching the battle from a distance. A shiver went down Grims's spine as he noticed the ship's design.

Countless ability users dropped from the ship. Honestly, the Graylash family thought they were reinforcements from either the Cursed faction or that of the Earthborn group, but increasing their numbers wouldn't do much for them with the situation they were in.

However, all of them dropped down in the middle of the fight, and the Graylash family couldn't believe their eyes. Some of the ability users in there were somewhat able to deal with the Dalki better than they were.

The Dalki that was soon to go up against Grim for another round soon found two blond figures standing in front of it.

Both of them then pressed their hands on the ground, and an invisible force field stopped its advance.

"I never once in my whole life thought that I would be happy to see you... I hope you won't chain me up again once this is all over." Grim joked.

"We…no longer want to live like that. With him gone, we can do as we wish, and we wish to join in this fight and help defend this place." An older middle-aged man answered.

Large explosions were going off to the right of Grim, a few hundred meters away. He knew that was where the other Humanoid Dalki was there as well, and that's when he noticed a young brother and sister pair.

"It looks like nearly the whole family is here."

————

"With the arrival of the Blades, and the Chained that they had reclaimed and gathered amongst the solar systems, they were able to overwhelm the new Gen Dalki in the end. However, considering how only a few had survived, they will no longer be taking part in the war and are returning to the Graylash planets." Sam explained.

Nate and Owen couldn't quite believe it. Like them, the second group had received help from the most unexpected people they thought of during the time. However, although one could say that they were victorious so far, truthfully, it was more like a draw since the forces couldn't continue.

After Sam had finished explaining, Nate and Owen reported everything that had occurred on their end and even told details of Erin. Nate thought it would be best to warn him, just in case Erin appeared in different places after this and also thought Sam would be the best person to know somewhat what to do with the information.

"I see. Right now, I think your suggestion is best, Nate. Owen can no longer fight in his current state, and he will head back to the Graylash faction with the survivors. You take a small combat ship; they are faster for movement if you run into trouble. Search for the Main Dalki base. If you find it, inform me, and Logan will send out an energy reading.

"With how many Dalki they have placed on these patents, I doubt that they will have much left. With each group that wins their remaining battles, I plan for them to go ahead and defeat the Demon tier beast."

Nate nodded along as he got a gist of what Sam was planning, but he realised that the latter hadn't told them about the bad news yet.

"The bad news?" Nate asked.

For a second, Sam paused.

"As you know, we had created nine forces to take on the Dalki forces. However, we have already lost one of the forces due to the incident with Sach and his Earthborn group. I thought the Dalki might stay still, but instead, the Dalki used this to their advantage. They saw the gap, and there is a Dalki mothership that is heading straight for the Daisy base."

"The Daisy base.... you mean the vampire settlement!" Nate cried back.

If the enemy was as formidable as they had faced here, and with all the vampire leaders away, Nate knew how much trouble the Daisy Planet was in.

"What about one of the Cursed factions group? Can't we send them back?" Nate asked.

Sam shook his head.

"This plan…we just have to hope that the vampire settlement can hold out without their leaders. We can't get distracted. No matter what, many lives will be lost. This is the final battle, Nate. We must locate their base and destroy it before they take down ours. Once we have taken over the main Dalki forces in the beast planet solar system, we can turn around and finish them off.

"Besides, there are no Cursed faction forces we can dispatch. The Blade group has just landed on a Dalki planet, and the bad news I was talking about wasn't even the Vampire settlement under attack. I got news from Sunny… she has run into Graham."

Nate's eyes winded after hearing that name. Being one of the few that had gone up against Graham, he knew how strong the latter was. Nate believed whoever ran into him, apart from Quinn, had no chance of surviving this fight.

"Call Quinn, tell Quinn immediately; we have to tell him!" Nate cried.

"I already tried," Sam replied. "We have even sent out a force from the settlement to the planet where Quinn is at. They are unable to move. All of the beasts on that planet have locked onto something. The vampires are fighting endlessly to protect the ship while Quinn is going through something. I have no idea how long Quinn will take, but we need to try our best to win this war without him.

"All we can do is wish our allies luck. The best thing we can do for them is to continue winning our battles. We have a tough battle of our own ahead of us." Sam said, ending the call there.

Owen was now done with his part, but Nate still had his mission to complete, as he wondered what on earth was Quinn doing.

[42 percent of nest crystal has been absorbed]

*****

# Chapter 1528 - Absorb The Crystal
Currently, a group of vampires was stationed on a swamp-like Planet. They took base on one of the few pieces of land that formed a small island-like structure. The vampires surrounded it to protect the ship from beasts.

The beasts had already destroyed the ship's engine, and at the moment, they didn't even have the time to repair it because nearly all of them were busy fighting the endless hordes of beasts that were coming their way.

Earl Ronsten, who was in charge of the expedition, was currently on top of the ship and staring at the scene.

'My word, what is going on this planet. I can see beasts coming from every direction. Is it because of the nest crystal that we have gathered? But it seems like his majesty is using it for something. All we have to do is keep defending. But, it feels more like a war between our small group and the countless beasts on this planet.'

It certainly did feel that way to everyone, especially those on the ground floor. The beasts weren't extremely powerful like the doppelgangers they had fought, but they still had some strength with them and numbers on their side.

On either side, protecting the north and south sides, were the two Viscounts leading two groups of vampires. Still, they had been fighting for hours and were now getting tired.

"Don't use your blood powers!" Viscount Norvic shouted as he slammed a giant tentacle-like creature on its head, causing black blood to splatter all over him and partly in his mouth. After pushing it back with a few more attacks, he resumed what he was saying.

"Using the blood powers will tire us out quicker; just carry on using your strength!"

The good news was that the other vampires were already used to this. When fighting against the doppelganger, they hadn't used their blood powers or abilities for fear that perhaps there would be more to come.

At the same time, they had done a lot of training and fighting themselves, so they knew what the enemy's weaknesses were. Although fighting against the doppelgangers was frightening and, at the same time, was incredibly frustrating, each of the vampires had improved their combat skills drastically because of it.

"I'm exhausted." Joy complained, her fists obscured in black blood. She was a fighter who mainly just punched her way out of the situation. However, it was using up more energy in this case than in any of her previous fights. Since she would just punch the beasts that came towards her rather than dodge obvious attacks.

"I have no more blood," Moe replied. "I used up what was in the flask. You will just have to hold out."

Unlike when vampires would fight against the Dalki or go against the humans, there was one thing that was different in fighting beasts: blood.

They could always reenergize themselves or restore their blood powers and abilities with blood during a fight. It was one of the scary things about vampires and one of the reasons why they didn't fear the Dalki even after learning a lot about the latter.

However, fighting beasts, they were unable to consume beast blood.

"We have reinforcements coming!" Ric shouted.

The others were finding it hard to split their attention, but they looked up to see just what he was talking about when they could. That's when they saw a ship in the sky, which was quite similar to the vampire ships.

Immediately, a group of about thirty or so vampires dropped down from the ship as reinforcements.

"They are... from the Fifth family." Viscount Nian noticed.

The fourth and fith family always had a close relationship, this was mainly due to Jim and Sunny being close to each other as leaders, and now the vampires were happy to see them more than ever.

A long black braided woman landed in front of one of the groups.

"We will take over from here; you guys rest up a bit."

With the reinforcements having arrived, Ronsten looked at the battlefield, but the number of beasts didn't seem to decrease. Still, the good news was that a mechanic had come with the group, and now, they had enough vampires to defend the place while the others could take the break they deserved.

The other large ship landed, only a few metres away from the ship Quinn and the others had arrived. They had brought supplies with them, including collections of blood which someone handed out to the others.

Of course, when contacting the vampire settlement, Ronsten had informed them of what they needed and the situation, which was why they could prepare everything beforehand.

At the moment, Ronsten had decided to enter the Fifth Family's ship, where he encountered someone, a girl who had a straight cut bang across her forehead and long hair winding on her back. She wasn't a vampire knight, but Ronsten knew her well because she was a decendent from the fifth family, Simer.

"I'm surprised to see you here." Ronsten bowed.

"It is an important task to do with the king, of course, I would be here, and on that note, I have informed my people not to attack the giant Gorilla. I am sorry, we were unaware that it was part of your group."

Ronsten couldn't help but chuckle. Honestly, he had forgotten that the Gorilla named Jesk, as they heard Quinn call him so many times, was still helping them out. However, the Gorilla tried its best to stay away from the ship.

They imagined the beast had a strong will; whatever was tempting the other beasts, the Gorilla was fighting against it to help his master.

"It was a surprise to us as well, and I honestly forgot about it, so my apologies as well."

The two of them went to sit down and continued to chat as Ronsten informed her of what was happening with Quinn and the plan. Should they leave the planet and head back to the shelter once the mechanic repairs the ship?

Quinn seemed to be unresponsive at the moment, so they were unable to ask him. Whatever the case, staying here wasn't an option. While asking, though, Ronsten noticed that Simer was often staring into space.

"What seems to be the problem?" Ronsten couldn't help but ask.

She was reluctant to tell him, but she eventually revealed after a few moments of silence.

"Before coming here, we had received a report. It was from Sunny herself; she is going up against one of the leaders of the Dalki. I know mothe... I mean, our leader is strong, but I can't help but worry. I was hoping to speak to Quinn, but it looks like it's currently not plausible."

Just then, they heard shouts from outside. The two rushed out of the ship, and they noticed that the sky above them had somewhat darkened. That was because now several winged beasts were hovering above them.

"This…will be troublesome," Ronsten frowned.

In the meantime, Quinn was inside the ship on his own. Everyone had cleared the area so as not to disturb him.

'Finally, I'm getting used to the feeling. The energy doesn't hurt my body anymore, but the energy... it's just swirling around my body. It doesn't feel like I can actually use it… this is a little worrying, but I have to keep absorbing the energy for now.

'If I do this, that pain will come back, but I need to absorb the energy faster. I have no clue how long I have been doing this, and I have no clue what is happening here. I can tell if I break concentration and the connection to the nest crystal... the energy from it will explode and crack. This is the only time I can do this.'

Absorbing more of the energy directly from the crystal, Quinn could feel a tremendous pain crawl through his body, but the process had now sped up. Rather than allowing the power to enter him, he was forcefully sucking it.

[52 percent of Nest crystal has been absorbed.]

# Chapter 1529 - A Six Spike
Flames were erupting from an enormous dropship on the desert-covered barren planet. Countless crates fell from the ship and tumbled in a wide area on the surface, though the fall from the sky wasn't enough to break the strong crates.

With the switches on, the crates moved, and it opened up, a swarm of dangerous vampire subclasses began to swarm out. Their numbers had barely diminished after the battles they had been used in so far.

From high up, if one was to look at the scene, it looked like a swarm of black ants were all heading towards Graham, the Dalki wearing clothes.

Sunny wasn't nearby Graham, but she could see him off in the distance with her enhanced eyesight. There were two others with her; Rokene was one of them, and the other was the older female Nina, travelling along with her on this expedition.

During the attacks so far, the two would usually stay in their ship, but due to the attack, the two weren't exactly able to do so anymore.

"You two, head back towards the ship. There should be a couple of combat ships still in good condition, so you should hurry." Sunny instructed.

"Are you telling us to leave you?" Rokene asked. "Leader, there is only one Dalki."

Of course, due to the reports they were handed out and the fact that this Dalki was on his own, Sunny knew that this was most likely the Dalki known as Graham.

The ship had crashed east from where the Dalki was, and the swarm of beasts soon was coming his way.

Surrounding the Dalki were several different crudely made black objects. They had no remarkable craftsmanship, and they looked like sticks stuck in the ground. This material was the same by which the Dalki made their ships and fortresses, and there was a special reason why Graham kept them next to him.

Picking one of them up from the ground, he hurled it towards the horde of beasts. The Wendigos and mouthspilters were the fastest and were ahead of the other subclasses. The second the object had left Graham's hand, it almost immediately had hit the group.

The vampires heard a loud bang as it broke through an air barrier, and all looked at it in disbelief. A whole section of the vampire subclasses had been wiped out from a single spear!

"Now I understand how it was able to destroy the ship's shield…it wasn't a special object or anything like that..it was the Dalki's pure power," Roken said as his lips were trembling.

After throwing the first spear, they saw six spikes piercing through Graham's oversized shirt from his back. However, the vampires couldn't gauge much about the power and strength of the Dalki.

Having fought against them, Sunny had learned of the strength and difference between the spikes. She remembered the vampire meeting, where Sam had stated a five spiked Dalki was the highest spiked Dalki they had seen, but now, they could clearly see six spikes on Dalki's back.

"This is an Order! Both of you hurry to the ship before it's too late. Make a report to Sam about everything you have seen here!" Sunny ordered again.

Although the horde of subclasses had taken quite the blow, and a single spear attack had wiped out around five percent of their forces, they were fearless and didn't understand better as they continued towards Graham.

In the meantime, Sunny didn't waste any more time and summoned her inner blood weapon. Rokene was watching everything, still frozen and not wanting to leave Sunny. He was a direct descendent of her. Although never treated as a successor to the Fifth family, at the end of the day, the person he was standing beside was his mother.

"We have to go. She ordered us to!" Nina shouted as she pulled Rokene away.

While running towards the ship, all Rokene could think of was one person.

'Quinn…if Quinn was here…he could save her…we have to tell Quinn…Quinn….where are you!'

Roken wanted to go back, but every time he would attempt to turn his head, Nina pulled his arm, forcing him to look in front of them until they had eventually reached the ablaze ship.

It was big, but they knew where the combat ships were placed. When getting to the back, they could see that the attack had damaged most of them, but one of them appeared to be in somewhat good condition.

"Wait, there's only one ship; how will Sunny get off this planet?" Rokene asked.

"There has to be a ship that the Dalki used or worst case, we will come back here when she has defeated him. She just wants us out of the way." Nina replied, and the two soon got in the small ship that could seat around four people at most. A combat ship had no space to move around.

After testing the controls, everything looked to be working just fine, and Nina began to pull the ship, getting it out of the burning drop ship and flying outwards. They immediately called Sam to report that Graham was here, on this planet, and they were about to leave it.

However, even though she was curious to see just what was going on, she slightly turned the ship, so they could see how the fight was going so far. That's when they couldn't believe their eyes. They hadn't taken long to get to the ship, but the battlefield already looked like a graveyard with over half of the subclasses slaughtered.

It took them a few minutes to regain their composure.

On the ground, the beasts had latched on their fangs, clawing at Graham, but could do nothing. A single swing of his hand and the air itself distorted, killing several of them in an instant.

Sunny looked to be standing behind a group of the subclasses, hoping for the right moment to jump in, but it didn't look like she would get a chance there.

"Any of the Dalki that had been killed by these pathetic creatures deserved to die," Graham said as he jumped up in the air. The jump itself had killed the beasts around him. He floated in the air for a moment, and then clenching his fists, he flew back towards the ground.

Slamming his fist down, the impact crushed the area beneath him, sending out a powerful shockwave. The beasts that were close had their bodies crushed before the fist even touched the ground. The nuclear-like fist had created a kilometre-wide crater in the ground, but it didn't stop there and continued to spread, creating more shockwaves, and soon, it reached three and finally four kilometres wide. The whole area was destroyed from the power of the punch alone, and it seemed like Graham had taken out all the beasts on the ground.

Sunny, who was caught up in the strong shockwave of the attack, had somehow managed to defend herself using blood hardening, but the shockwave destroyed her weapon, and at the same time, blood dripped from the corner of her mouth due to internal injuries.

'This….this power is on the same level as Laxmus…no... it was an ordinary punch, and the Dalki himself wasn't even injured, which means…this wasn't his full strength.'

Graham looked around with a calm expression, not fatigued at all. He picked up one of the vampire subclasses' bodies near his feet. It was a mouthspitter whose body was primarily intact still from the shockwave but was clearly dead.

Opening his mouth wide, he soon started to chew down on it, crushing its bones and anything inside with his strong jaws and teeth.

"It's time for me to have a feast and get stronger. Thank you so much for bringing all of these to me."

Seeing what happened from a distance and the shockwave somewhat shaking the ship, Nina started to fly out of the area.

"What are you doing…are we going to abandon her? If we do... she will die!" Rokene cried.

Nina's eyes were also moist as tears streamed down her cheeks.

"If we stay, then we would be dead as well. At least her life will mean we get to live." She wanted to leave the planet safely.

Now Sunny's fate was in Graham's hands.
