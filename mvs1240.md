# Chapter 1240 Winning the battle, but losing the war
For the viewers watching through the livestream, when they had seen Hilston Blade defeated, they had been sure that this was the end. Someone of such great power they had never known even existed a couple hours ago, they had lost him as quickly as they had found out about him.

He had powers that surpassed the former Big Four and he had been able to use their powers one after another to a stronger degree. If even someone like him could not defeat the five Spike, then the world couldn't imagine who else could. Their anger and frustration had been directed towards the one that had caused his death, who was none other than Sil, another Blade that belonged to the Cursed faction.

Soon, they thought that his death and the rest of their deaths would quickly come after, something most felt deserving for having gotten involved. They also looked to be losing out against the five Spike, but all of that changed with the arrival of the Cursed faction leader.

"Why is the reporter getting so excited to see Quinn arrive? Does she really think that he is going to be able to do anything?"

"I don't know and I don't care. There goes my diet, since we're all going to die anyway, might as well enjoy the rest of my life eating everything I have avoided so far."

"Weren't there rumours about them having a fling? Of course, she needs to hype up her boyfriend."

"But isn't he the one who defeated all those Dalki back then? Maybe he can do something again. I don't want to die. The Dalki has to be nearly dead! They just have to give it one more push!"

Most of them didn't believe one person could change anything, yet the flow of the entire fight had changed.

——

Bonny had instructed Void to make sure to capture the intense look off Quinn's eyes as they glowed red, and the cameraman also managed to show off the point when the Cursed faction leader's soul weapon was activated. Shadows had risen all around everywhere, and using the strange sword, the Vampire Lord had managed to block the tail attack.

In the end, although Sil and the others were the ones that had finished off the Dalki with the last attack, it was clear as day to everyone that none of it could have been achieved without the last one to arrive.

——

People were jumping for joy around all the different planets as they saw humanity defeat the great Dalki. A five spiked Dalki had never been seen before, apart from One Horn, so they were sure they had delivered a huge blow to their forces.

——

"Quinn, you and your group, you actually managed to defeat a five spike. You really will become our hope." Sach thought.

Samantha, who was by his side, was shaking instead. When they had gone against One Horn, they hadn't even been able to draw out his full strength, judging by the video they had just watched.

'How… how am I meant to defeat someone like One Horn if this is how strong they can get?' She thought. Worst yet, how was anyone able to defeat a five spike now. Did they have to rely on the Cursed faction? Even within the Dalki, one spike's strength could differ by quite a bit, so she wondered if it was the same for the five spikes.

There was no telling what would happen if they were to meet another one, and this time there would be no Hilston Blade to weaken it first.

———

"Haha, Quinn you did it! Did you see that everyone? He used my blade to do it!" Longblade cheered for joy as he watched the fight with his subordinates. "That means that I played a major part in taking that thing down. It was because of me that he was able to defeat the Dalki!"

"Yes sir, it was smart of you to give him that blade, knowing he would be able to use it ahead of time." Avion complimented his superior, clearly knowing that that hadn't been Longblade's intention at all. Still it couldn't hurt to entertain him.

"I hope we get to meet them again." Rafer added.

———

Back on the Cursed planet themselves, they were more joyous than before, those that were on the fence about Quinn, since he had revealed he was a V had almost forgotten all about that. They were proud to have a leader like that and such a strong team.

'Quinn, thank God you survived. I guess I need to do my part as well to enjoy that future.' Helen mused.

———

Of course, even the Dalki had received the news, and Graham who had been paying attention to the whole thing in particular, seemed to be enraged.

"Damn it, to think we would lose Slicer this early on!" Graham cursed, and swung his arm, smashing the glass container by his side. The liquid flowed out onto the floor and the Dalki body with it. Soon, Graham was seen making a call to a certain someone. When the call was answered, Graham didn't hold back.

"I thought the idea of teaming up with that vampire was that the other vampires wouldn't get involved! That damn Cursed faction leader is a vampire, isn't he? So why did he act against us?!" Graham demanded to know an answer.

"Graham, I would suggest you take a deep breath. Anger doesn't suit you. Our plan is proceeding even better than we had estimated, despite things that we didn't foresee. In the first place, that boy has always been a special case. I just never expected him to cause this many problems for us in such a short time. Tell me your honest opinion, do you regard him as a problem you need my help with? Or is he someone you can deal with on your own?" The person asked.

Seeing Quinn fight, and the others, Graham, was trying to put himself in the same place as Slicer.

"I don't need your help, not that you alone would be much of a help anyway." Graham grumbled. "However… I will have to adjust my plans without Slicer. Don't you complain about me taking a more 'liberal' approach from now on."

Graham ended the call there, going through the footage once more, in hopes to spot whatever he could. He rewinded the video a few times, and played it forward watching it again and again.

'I'm sure of it. One of those that were watching the fight on the sand dune and the Dalki that got involved in the fight, that four spike are the same person. They look almost human-like when they are on the Sand Dune. Yet, when fighting and showing the spiked the Dalki features appear more so. Something is going on. Perhaps I have found myself a new research subject. Maybe I can make him replace Slicer?'

'But first, I really need to calm myself down a little...'

Graham walked to the Dalki body on the floor, still thinking that perhaps the Dalki and Quinn were linked in some way, and lifted it off the ground.

"You might have won this battle, but I promise you I will make you pay the price for it." Graham spoke, before crushing the lifeless Dalki's head.

———

Deactivating his soul weapon, the after effects of using it were now being shown, making him lose some of his MC points. They were currently at 1100. He hadn't used it for long, so the points lost weren't too major. The others were now running towards Quinn to see if he was okay, while Sil was picking up his arm as well.

When they walked past Hilston, some of them decided to side step or take the long way around his body, and it was the same for Slicer's corpse as well.

"Quinn, are you alright? It's you inside your body, right?" Fex asked his best friend to make sure.

"Yeah, it's me." Quinn answered, not fully knowing what had happened while he had been away. More so, the Cursed faction leader was interested in something else. Since he wasn't in his body when he had met Slicer, Quinn was unaware that he had received a Quest.

However, he wasn't the one that killed Slicer, so he didn't seem to get any exp, and since the Blades weren't a part of his Cursed faction family the exp from the kill wasn't shared either. Nevertheless, he did come out with a reward.

'After all that trouble, I had to have gotten something.' Quinn thought. Before looking at it, the Vampire Lord was reflecting on the fight. He was wondering if they would have been able to defeat the other five spikes that he had met.

Hilston had done a lot of damage to the Dalki beforehand. Although the Dalki was stronger due to the damage, some of the injuries Hilston had done to the Dalki were beyond regular healing. On top of that, the female Dalki had displayed great vitality to the point she had been able to regenerate an even strengthened tail. Still, he estimated that the majority of the damage had been Hilston's achievements, with the next highest amount being Slicer's choice of hurting herself.

The main problem when facing the five Spike, was how tough its skin was, and how hard it was to even do a little bit of damage. Hilston with his demon tier armour's active skill had time to charge up a strong enough attack, but Quinn was unable to do the same, even with his Shadow overload skill since it didn't really increase his attack power.

He had the speed and he might have had the defence, but he lacked the power to go against his enemies like Hilston. Which was why Quinn hadn't insisted on being the one to deal out the last blow, leaving that to Sil.

'If it was a fight from the beginning, we all would have died even with my soul weapon, and we know the Dalki have at least two other five spikes. Worst of all, that weird Dalki is creating a method to evolve the spikes on their backs.' It was bad news, and unless Quinn could reach the next stage, he saw no way of them winning the war.

Checking his rewards, Quinn was hoping for something good, now he needed the system to deliver more than ever, but what he didn't realise, was as soon as Slicer had been defeated, the fighting had resumed with even more frenzy on the Dalki side.

[Quest failed]

[12/10 Cursed planets have been taken over.]

# Chapter 1241 - An Investigation
Three men were seen walking through a busy street. There were market stalls set up selling trinkets, food, ability books and more. Crystals were placed in lamps giving off a nice orange glow on the items and pathway, and the reflection of red could be seen in the people's eyes.

Currently, the group of three men who worked under Paul were on this very street. They didn't just work for Paul as a Vampire knight, but previously when he was the head general as well. The place they were in at the moment was the pool area, away from the tenth castle inner area.

For them, it was a place they didn't venture into often. The tenth family mostly sent on separate hunts on the planet itself, hunting for crystals. Either through the forest and the vast land or through some of the portals the tenth family owned. It was interesting to find out that the vampires knew of planets that existed out of those in Earth's solar system and the beast's planets solar system.

Due to their high-tech, they also didn't need so many different portals linked to each planet and instead could input codes that would take them to such worlds. The vampires were just as interested in using beast crystals as humans, but it was more so to advance their technology and power their equipment, rather than for the use of beast equipment in a war.

Still, the pool area was avoided in the tenth family because of the disconnect it currently had with the other families. After Quinn had defeated the second leader and stopped the rebellion from Cindy, he had been hailed a hero. There were many that had requested to join, but most of them had been turned away.

Quinn wanted to treat those that were loyal to the tenth family, who were with them despite the mistreatment and being considered weak. Some vampires thought that if they were to join the tenth family, it would be an easy promotion to the inner circle. Since they had failed to be promoted in their own circles for so long. After realising this wouldn't work, they bore a grudge.

At the same time, the general public didn't like the fact that the tenth area was more reinforced than the rest of the castles. The walls were better, and there were those strange towers that packed quite the punch. It was something the other families just didn't have, causing them to feel jealous.

These were the reasons why the tenth family, if they could avoid it, decided to stay out of the pooling area. The three that were there today, one of them had been appointed as captain of the vampire group under Paul called Ashley. He was one of the first ones to be turned, and the two with him were Ben and Ghost.

While travelling, they were carefully looking around the area, sticking close together.

"I thought it was a good idea to take off our armour. That makes us stick out like a sore thumb, but it looks like the others are still looking at us." Ben commented while not backing down as he locked eyes with another family member.

The armour he was talking about was the special set that would be rewarded to those in the tenth family. The system that had initially been implemented by Timmy. Now that the tenth family was back up and running again, Timmy had decided to start up again, but it stood out since the armour was quite distinctive.

"You have to remember, there aren't a lot of vampires here in the first place. They probably see the same faces every day and have done so for years. Just remember why we are here." Ashley said, looking down. He held a tablet with a list of names, and some of the names had green circles by the side.

Eventually, they had taken a turn down an alleyway, away from the main busy street. Now they were in a block of strange-looking houses. In the pooling area, the vampires lived stacking on top of each other like apartments, but three stories was the limit. So they didn't have huge tall skyscrapers like human cities.

Taking the stairs at the side of the building, they climbed up to the top floor and gave a few knocks.

"Careful, you remember the last one came out attacking us on the spot." Ghost said.

After a few knocks, it seemed like there was no answer.

"Victormen Ten, are you there!" Ashley shouted and gave a few more knocks. After no such answer, Ashley gave the nod towards ben.

With a firm push, the door snapped open. It was only a wooden door after all. In the pooling area, they never exactly expected to have intruders. Perhaps there would be arguments from other vampires, but they allowed for vampires to mostly deal with that themselves. If a vampire died fighting, well that vampire just wasn't strong enough and shouldn't have started a fight in the first place.

The three of them searched the room carefully to see if there were signs of anything. The room was quite small. It was similar to a studio apartment, with a bed tv, and the kitchen area all in one place, only the bathroom was separate. It was then that they spotted that a corner of the table was snapped.

It perhaps wasn't a big deal, but it seemed strange since it had broken off and there were a few splinters on the ground. It should have been cleaned by now.

"Are you sure you told him to stay in his house around this time?" Ashely asked.

"Of course, I know how important this is. I'm not going to make that type of mistake." Ghost replied.

Ben then let out a sigh.

"I can't believe it. The vampires are having people taken away from them, and they don't even notice it. I mean, I know we wouldn't have noticed if we weren't doing this as well, but with so few people, you think they would keep better track."

"Apparently, it's because the vampires live in the polling area. If their lives are lost, other vampires just see this as an opportunity to have children. To try and create stronger vampires for the future. With the cap of vampires per family and their long lifespan, it would take a long time before they were allowed any children. I guess their solution is to not really care about the lives of those in the pooling area." Ashley updated the tablet, and now there was a big X by one of their names. It wasn't the only name with an X either, as Ashley went back a few days searching through the names.

People who were from the tenth family and in the polling area were going missing. There were no signs of confrontation. No sign of criminal activity either. They would just vanish, and later it would be reported as a death.

Of course, the one who had ordered this investigation was none other than Paul. He had been advised by Kazz to not look into things, but he felt like if they were to look the other way, or not find out who was the one behind it all, then there was a good chance that the situation would just get worse. Soon they would think they could step other all of the tenth family.

"Well, we know that they are taking people from the tenth area, that's for sure. The question is, we don't know where they went. Judging by the table, I think this one might have been quite recent. We could ask the people who live in the area, but we all know how that has gone so far." Ashley suggested.

Ghost grabbed his arm, a wound that had long healed, but they knew how much hostility there was towards the tenth family. It was strange because they had believed the situation had gotten better, but it was almost as if somehow it had gotten worse.

Before any of the others, Ashley heard footsteps coming from outside. The sound of the vampires in the street could be heard from all of them, so it wasn't too out of the ordinary, but Ashley could tell that the footsteps were constant and coming at a fast rate.

"Someone's coming!" Ashley shouted, and soon all three of them drew their weapons. Ashley a standard sword, while Ben and Ghost had pulled something that resembled a pitchfork, but they were far more deadly than pitchforks.

Soon a blur could be seen entering the room, and Ashley struck in its place. He couldn't quite see the figure or who it was but just had to guess. However, his sword managed to amount to nothing as it was being gripped tightly.

"A weapon made from the blood fairy, I guess the tenth family still hasn't gotten rid of these. Although you do have privileges, the others don't. For finding such a weapon on a family member, the verdict would usually be death, all apart from the tenth family that is." The voice said.

Now that the target was no longer moving, Ashley could see who it was that he had struck at. He wore a full set of black armour, his upper body gigantic and wide and on his head a black specially designed Helmet covering his face.

"Muka, the ninth leader…" Ashley said in disbelief.

"It looks like the tenth family has already caught on to something strange happening in the settlement. I thought without Quinn, Edward and that Blind swordsman that you would have been slow on the uptake. Or too afraid to act, I guess the tenth family are a little different. Let me be straight with you, tell your Vampire knight that I want to help with his little investigation." Muka explained.

# Chapter 1242 - Dethrone The King
Although Ashley hadn't been in the vampire settlement for long, there was one thing that had been rammed in their heads, by Xander, Timmy and Amy. The fact that if a vampire leader requested something, they were to comply.

Of course, there were certain things they could decline, especially if it was something that would cause a conflict with another family. Still, in any case, it was always better to act first and then later to report what had happened.

Because of this, Ashley was in a position where he had to do what was asked and had called Paul ahead of time. He felt a little down since if he was more alert or cautious, they could have perhaps escaped or left the place before anyone had seen them.

Still, Paul had agreed to the meeting, and now, both Muka and Paul were in the tenth castle together. Sat opposite each other in his personal office.

"Do you ever take that helmet off? In the human world, it would be considered quite rude that I don't get to see your face." Paul asked.

Muka still was covered in the armour that he always wore, and this included his helmet. The truth was, there weren't many that had ever seen Muka take off the helmet, and there were those who were too afraid to ask as well.

"Is everyone in the tenth family as rude as this. I suppose in military terms, I would have a higher rank than you. You know, in the past, I had joined a few wars myself, although we didn't use guns and such. So I have experience being in armies. Let's say even if I don't belong to your squad. I don't suppose you would ask a superior why they were to keep on such a thing, would you?" Muka asked.

Paul thought about it for a while. He knew what he was doing. He knew that to ask about such a thing could be considered offensive, but if someone really wanted to work with them, they would have to take this offence in their stride.

If they didn't, they would use this offence as an excuse to attack. Muka had done neither but just was trying to reeducate Paul in a way.

"I would," Paul answered. "If the two of us were close, I would feel comfortable asking about these things. Sometimes some relationships are beyond rank, and I suppose what you might be asking me to do would go beyond rank, would it not?" Paul replied.

After hearing where Muka had arrived at and catching Ashley and the others. Paul could only assume that the two of them were looking into the same thing. The question was, had both of them arrived at the same conclusion about who was just behind all of this.

"Your family isn't the only one that has had people go missing. So far, every single family has been affected." Muka stated, ignoring the comments from earlier. "I don't think any of the other leaders have others to look into this, or at worst, it seems some have chosen to ignore this. This is why I'm finding it difficult to pinpoint who is exactly behind this. Right now, my only cleared suspect is the tenth family."

"And why haven't you suspected that Bryce is behind this?" Paul said straight after. "I have been by Quinn's side for a while now, and I have been watching all of the leader's actions. Whenever there was a chance, you would be sure to suspect Bryce. Honestly, I thought today you would do the same, so why not him?"

Paul hadn't found any leads, leading this back to Bryce. It was strange because his disappearance would sometimes lead them to other families, not just the first family. However, because of the way Kazz had acted, he had a suspicion it had something to do with the first family and who else but the king of vampires to have connections to all of the families. Or even be brave enough to do such a thing.

"Because I was wrong in the past, and this time I need to be careful. I have always been trying to do things myself, and I know someone was behind the death of my own knights. However, I can't go around calming things, especially now." Muka replied.

By saying these words, Paul knew it was because now Bryce was in a higher position than he was before. As a leader, accusations could be made from others due to being the same rank, but an allegation about the king, in times like these. They would think Muka was trying to stir something up again.

"Very well, then let me put a hypothetical question in front of you. Say if the king was to commit a crime as grave as this, is there a way to dethrone him? Or perhaps punish even the king for such crimes?" Paul asked.

"There is, or perhaps I should say there was," Muka replied. "The council has the power to vote in the king. Rightly so, the leaders also have the right to dethrone him as well. However, evidence must first be provided why he is unfit, and then there would be a vote. If a king was voted in, it would be very hard to convince those who voted for him to overturn their vote. There is also fear that with the king's power, they could force votes from the other leaders.

"The second problem is starting a trial in the first place. Usually, in the past, the evidence would be provided to the fourteenth family. The punishers, a power equal to the king. This allowed the leaders to vote freely, as they knew the punisher would be able to force the king to the council's bidding. As you know, they are no longer with us. Without the Punishers, the king in these times have greater power.

"Lastly, even if a vote to dethrone the king was to happen, there would need to be a candidate that was fit for this purpose, and honestly, I don't think there is anyone that the other leaders can be behind. I worry for us.

"You may have noticed that the tenth family's mistreatment has started again, but it is not just your family. It is the other families as well. With Bryce coming into power, the divide between the vampire sides has only grown. Those who think we should leave this place come out of hiding and rule over the humans. And those who believe we should be their protectors.

"Still, we can use this to our advantage and gather vampires that could vote to throw Bryce out, but first, we need evidence," Muka explained.

"And what about someone who could deal with Bryce if he didn't agree?" Paul asked.

For this, Muka had no answers.

———

In the third castle was the third vampire leader Suzan. She was currently in her room that was filled with dolls upon dolls of all sizes. They weren't just human dolls but teddy bears, different animals and more.

Right now, she was using her special needles to sow outfits for them all. In particular, it was a large one she was working on today. However, her hands were a bit unsteady. She had pricked her fingers a few times, again and again.

"What is Bryce thinking?" She thought, with her knees trembling as she continued to sow. "He told us he had a plan but then doesn't inform us of what is going on. Why do I always decide to listen and follow him? I followed him back then, I followed him with the vote and now… it's too late."

She suddenly pricked her finger again, this time deeper. She had stopped for a few seconds waiting for the wound to heal and then was ready to start again. It was the only way she could get the worry out of her head, but when she tried to move her hand, it was suddenly grabbed.

"You're right, it is too late, and now it is time for you to be punished for your crimes." A dark voice said.

When Suzan looked around her, she soon noticed that all the walls were covered in pitch black. Shadows were everywhere, and no matter how loud she would scream, no one could hear it. Her, a vampire leader, one of the strongest vampires, was shivering in fear because she knew there was no hope.

# Chapter 1243 A message to them
The forest with the dark purple leaves could sometimes seem endless, with the terrain changing very little for Erin and Leo. Mountains, small rivers, lakes, ponds, and of course, trees, plenty, plenty of trees.

Although the two of them wished to stay near the vampire settlement, Erin's senses improved by the day. Each time, they were able to head out further from the settlement, and Erin could still sense the general direction of where the vampires were.

This was something unique to her as a dhampir. At the same time, it seemed like she was controlling her powers better, but control wasn't the only thing she was getting good at.

They had ventured further out because the vampires in the area now seemed non-existent. What surprised them as they did this was that even as they further explored the planet, there would always be a stray out there somewhere.

Some of them were minding their own matters, just wishing to live a life away from the settlement. They chose to leave them alone while others were running away from crimes they had committed.

The second they saw Leo and Erin, they thought they were from the settlement and had come to chase them down. Still, Leo didn't kill them instantly, or at least he didn't make it so Erin would because he wanted to find out more about them. Find out their reason for leaving. With his influence skill as a vampire knight, there weren't many that could resist his control.

The rivers had become a frequent place for the two of them to stop at. For some reason, the sound of the water running down was calming for both of them. Sitting on top of a stone, Leo was observing, more so with his ears.

With the sound of the river, chains could be heard and then shortly after, the sound of the wind being cut. This repeated several times with certain gaps of sound in between. As if someone was going through specific steps.

Each time this was repeated, not a single time did the pattern not repeat in the exact matter. It was perfect, again and again until finally, the pattern was off.

'The timing, it was off.'

"Stop!" Leo shouted.

Instantly, chains fell to the floor, and huffing and panting from Erin could be heard.

"You have done remarkably well. When we came here, I only wanted to help you control the energy inside you, but it looks like you have been able to achieve more than that." Leo complimented her. "Creating your own swordsmanship, one that incorporates the suppression chains, is no easy matter. You have done well creating these 6 different movements.

"You have nearly perfected them. However, there is one thing that we can't fix," Leo said, looking at his own blade.

When fighting the four spiked Dalki, he saw how effective agent 1's weapons were against it. Leo's weapon wasn't weak, but it was granted a boost in power due to the curse it had on it. This only helped when fighting against the Dalki, but even against a four spike, the boost wasn't enough.

"I have the Demi-god tier crystal that had been given to me by that man we met. I would like you-"

"No." Erin interrupted Leo. "Leo, you have your own goal, and to do that, you need stronger weapons as well. We know that Pure's leader is most likely your old master from what you have told me.

"I'm sure you have heard the rumours as well as I have. That Pure has a Demon tier weapon in their possession. I know your skills are great Leo, I know you are strong. Unfortunately, I think this just is something skill can't overcome. Besides, I haven't finished the move set yet. I plan for there to be 12 movements altogether."

Leo was taken aback by this. Erin's progression had been extraordinary. Her strength had grown fast, to the point where now it was nearly at his own. However, there were a few things Leo still had an advantage of Erin in. His control of Qi was more fine-tuned, while at the same time, he had experience. His fighting sense and tactics were above hers, but Erin was young, and this could be improved.

When she had told Leo she was going to create her own swordsmanship style, he was impressed, and when she actually achieved it, he didn't think he could be surprised again, yet here they were.

"From the vampires, the Bloodsuckers we have killed so far, we have gathered all different types of Blood crystals. Learning how to use the Katana-style sword with the suppression chains will be the first six moves, and I plan to have a weapon created from their blood crystals.

"I can finally help the others in the Cursed faction. When I first was sent to Pure, I hated it, I thought why me, but slowly I realised that Quinn, Layla. All of them saved my life from Truedream, and then they saved me again. It's time to return the favour.

"However, I don't want to forget my past either. The longsword I used to use, and the swordsmanship that was taught to me by my parents. I wish to improve it, and I plan to create another set of six movements for that weapon. That will be my beast weapon."

Hearing this, Leo thought it represented Erin quite well, to have one best weapon that the humans used and one blood weapon that the vampires used. The only thing was they didn't have the current weapons. For her, Longsword had broken.

"I think it's time we head back to the Cursed faction then. We can obtain the crystals needed for this and ask Alex to forge us both new weapons for our journey. It's been a long time." Leo smiled.

Heading back through the forest, they realised they were quite far out, and even with their speed, it would take around half a day to return, but before they could even move from the river, they sensed two large objects coming their way.

Crashing in front of the two stones were chucked into the river, and small waves were made pushing it over the edge. A great wind force had hit both of them.

'What happened? If they were vampires, I should have sensed them from a mile away.' Erin thought.

Leo had quickly drawn his sword. Now they were in front of them, he knew what they were.

"They are in a place like this!"

"Who would have thought that we would see two stray vampires all the way out here at a place like this." One of the attackers said.

"I bet they were surprised to see our return but too bad you won't be telling anyone anything." The other said.

The two that had appeared in front of them were Dalki. The Dalki had arrived on the vampire planet, but what were they doing so out of the settlement.

When both Erin and Leo had seen the number of spikes on the back, they weren't worried at all, for there was only one.

"I've been waiting, waiting for a while to do this!" Erin said as she went in for the attack.

It was safe to say that neither of the Dalki's had lasted very long, and both of their heads were seen rolling on the floor.

After dealing with the Dalki, they both continued to head to the vampire settlement. It was safe to say they didn't have a clue why the Dalki were there, but they had decided to head back towards the settlement to see if something was up.

They could have tried to find where the Dalki had come from, but so far out, they thought it was a risk. At the same time, Leo wanted to know more before doing anything. This perhaps would be a matter where they would need to contact Quinn as well.

When they finally were coming close to the settlement, the two wore their cloaks covering up their faces and heads. There were guards stationed outside the settlement and even in the forest area, which they hadn't seen before. Regardless, for Erin and Leo, it was easy to bypass them without being seen, using the terrain of the trees and more.

'Could it be that the Dalki really have attacked the settlement as well?' Leo thought.

However, when they entered the settlement, there was a strange feeling coming from the people. They could hear whispering and moans from everyone.

"What do we do! What do we do!"

"This has never happened before, and they managed to get inside!"

"Who could be strong enough to even do such a thing!"

The people were in a panic.

"Is it what we saw before?" Erin asked Leo, not wanting to say the name of the creatures in case someone had overheard them.

"No, this seems to be something different. The people look to be moving towards a certain place, and there are no signs of an attack. Let's follow them and see." Leo replied.

Following the crowds of people, they could see that some of the vampires had tears in their eyes. Others were shaking as they moved back.

"Everyone stand back, from the third castle! Get away from the third castle. This is an order!" A group of vampires shouted.

Seeing who they were, one could see that they were the Royal guard. A group of fifty or so vampires that worked directly under the king. They had the same power as a vampire knight. Currently, Ten of them were marching through, heading towards the third castle.

When Leo and Erin finally went there, they could see what everyone was looking at. From the pooling area, just outside the third castle inner area, one could see the whole castle in view. At the very top, the leader Suzan Toppy had been pinned using stakes to the wall. Her blood dripped on the castle walls, and there was no sign of life from her.

It was very clear that the third leader had been killed, and someone wanted to make sure that everyone knew about it.

# Chapter 1244 The penalty
A moment of peace was achieved, but that was all it was, a moment. The human race was able to celebrate the victory they had achieved over the five spike. The fighting around the beast solar system had stopped as everyone's eyes were glued to the screen, and in the end, they had obtained a victory.

However, it was as if the Dalki, now we're fighting Vengeance, having witnessed one of their leaders killed. The attacks on the planets on each of the Human groups' sections was now in full force. The mother ships had dropped the Dalki, allowing them to build fortresses. Once finished, the ships moved to the next planet for support.

Those that had been taken over, a token group of Dalki were left behind as the others joined forces with the struggling planets. Eventually, overwhelming the human race on each of the Shelters. It hadn't even taken an entire day. All of this was done within a few hours after Slicer's defeat.

In the end, each of the groups, including the Cursed faction, had decided to concentrate their forces even more so. The Earthborn group, the Graylash group and the Cursed faction were just down to controlling three planets each.

In order for the Dalki to keep control of each of the planets, their forces were thinned out more and more, until eventually, the Dalki themselves knew that if they were to attack, it would be a struggle.

It was a shame because even the planets that Quinn had destroyed motherships on, eventually were forced to retreat as neighbouring forces came over.

The problem was, with so few planets, the pushing issue of Crystals was becoming more apparent. There were just too few resources to go around to keep up the fight, and if the human race didn't do something soon, they would slowly meet their end.

The Cursed faction was in a bit better state and situation compared to the others. This was thanks to Quinn. After destroying the Motherships on said planets, Quinn informed the faction leader that the ships contained many Crystals on board.

Since Quinn was in his Dalki form when defeating these motherships, he could not store the crystals in his system. Fortunately, all of the factions were able to obtain the crystals inside. Which meant the Cursed faction didn't have a short supply like the other factions. Still, even for them, time would eventually run out.

Back on planet Caladi, the planet filled with sand, the Cursed faction had yet to leave the place. The Shelter had been quickly rebuilt, but certain parts were needed for the Bertha ship to be fully up and running again.

The good news was, with the Blade family working together, they were able to use their strong telekinesis powers to move the whole ship to the back of the Shelter, away from where they had crashed landed. With their help, they could fix the ship even quicker.

At the moment, the Cursed faction would use this planet as their base, but they weren't alone. Out of the three planets that were considered safe for the Earthborn faction, planet Caladi was one of them.

After Slicer had been defeated, the mothership that was overlooking them had left. They later found out it was to join another planet. Still, there were currently no Dalki ships present at all on planet Caladi. Even on the other two Earthborn planets, there were still Dalki motherships and fortresses, so it made it one of the safest places for people to be, that included for civilians.

With the help of Sam, the Shelter was going through an extension. Earth ability users were put to use, and once again, the Blade family. They were able to do what a small group of earth users would be required for.

Due to all the problems, it led to a world meeting, as they needed to strategise what their plan of action was next. Of course, both Owen and Helen were unable to leave their bases, so they would be joining the meeting virtually.

However, the Cursed group were waiting on Sach to arrive at the planet, as he had left Samantha in charge, who seemed to have her head screwed back on again. As well as this, Sam had called all the main Cursed leaders, apart from Helen, to arrive at Planet Caladi as well. This included the likes of Alex, Wevil and Linda.

At the moment, Quinn was resting in the military base that was located on the Shelter. Standing outside were many guards and people cheering outside. After what they had seen and everything that happened, they wanted to thank Quinn.

The others in the Cursed faction were also experiencing praise and gifts from strangers. It was nice for the public to have a good opinion of them for a change. For Quinn himself, he had told everyone to leave him be, for now, and he would be ready by the time Sach and the others arrived.

Quinn was sitting in a comfy office chair, swirling around spinning, looking at the metallic plain room. It felt strange that the person who had last used this thing was dead, but his mind was being filled with all sorts of odd thoughts like that because he was still at a loss for what to do after defeating Slicer.

Opening up his system, he could see a countdown timer that told him he had 12 hours remaining and was counting down the seconds.

First, Quinn had looked at the quest rewards for beating Slicer. Apparently, at the time, Vincent had received two clearance options for the quest. One of them was to survive. Usually, Quinn would get this type of quest if the system didn't think he would live.

However, Quinn had proved the system wrong once before and received great rewards because of it. This time, the system had also given Quinn a second way to clear the request, which was to defeat Slicer.

The problem was because Quinn wasn't the one that had dealt the finishing blow, and due to Sil and the Balde family not being part of Quinn's cursed family, he didn't receive any exp from the Slicer death, nor meet the requirements to clear the quest.

Alas, he did meet the requirements to complete the survival quest, which had given him an extra level, which 'would' have brought him up to level 70. The level where Quinn had suspected there was another evolution.

Regardless, the quest failure had come into play. The major quest to destroy ten Dalki ships before ten planets had been taken over and the penalty was given. Judging by the size of the quest, Quinn thought the plenty would be big, but he had no idea just how large it was.

First of all, he had lost a level, bringing Quinn back down to 69. He still was unsure if at 70 he would have evolved since both quests seemed to have finished around the same time. Still, the bad news didn't stop there.

The penalty had continued, with Quinn taking a hit in his stat points. All of his stats were lowered by five.

[Strength 65]

[Agility 65]

[Stamina 68]

[Charm 55]

This seemed like a bigger hit than losing a level. After all, Quinn only got one stat point for each level up, so he thought the system was being excessive. It also made him wonder what the reward would have been if he had completed it.

Still, beast gear could make up for these stats, and Quinn had thought of a solution to the problem. More people were being transported to the current Shelter they were staying at. The reason why Quinn had stopped taking drops of blood from his members was because he had already consumed that from all those on the Cursed ship.

At the level he was at, it was taking a 100 to 200 drops of blood to gain a single stat point. However, with the number of new people in the Shelter, Quinn could easily gain the lost stats back by taking a drop of blood from each of them. The public now knew what Quinn was and hailed him as a hero. If he explained this would allow him to get stronger, he thought they would easily comply.

Regardless of all that, the worst penalty was yet to come, and that was within 24 hours Quinn was to give the system a Demi-god tier item or higher. Or it would forcefully take one from him within that time.

'The system keeps impressing me by the day.' Vincent said. 'All these penalties you have experienced were implemented in the game. When the user would die, at times, a random item would drop from that body. Of course, the system isn't expecting you to die, so maybe this is its version of it, taking an item from you.'

Right now, Quinn didn't want to hear how impressed Vincent was with the system. He still had to explain Vincent to everyone at some point as well, but the looming timer over his head meant he would have to decide soon.

The only equipment he had at the Demi-god tier or above was the Demon tier amulet, and the Demi-god tier gauntlets. Hilston's equipment had been damaged beyond repair as well, so Quinn had to make a choice, and he needed to do so soon.

*******

# Chapter 1245 - Fixing The Issue
The timer was ticking down, and twelve hours wasn't enough time for Quinn to exactly go hunting. Although the teleporters were up and running on planet Caladi, the teleporters were no longer working on the planets that the Dalki had taken control of. They were assumed to be destroyed.

The remaining planets that were still owned all had motherships that still had the jammers on board. The worst thing of all was the fact that Quinn was on a green portal planet. The highest tier beast that would be found here was an intermediate tier beast.

It looked like in the end, Quinn had no choice but to give the system something.

'Arghh, this countdown is torture. If I have to get rid of something, I might as well decide now.' Quinn thought.

He had taken off the gauntlets and placed them both on the table in front of him and had done the same with the Demon tier amulet. The gauntlets both had a strong passive and active skill in each of them. If it wasn't for the poison, perhaps Quinn would have struggled more with Agent 2. At the same time, draining mana was undoubtedly handy, even against the Dragon Demon tier beast.

However, how could he possibly think of getting rid of the Demon tier amulet when he had only just gotten it. With his stats having been lowered, the amulet was good in many ways. He could possibly travel to other planets where the Dalki numbers were few and obtain a few Marked.

Quinn still wanted to perform his little test to see if he could evolve the Dalki himself, and then when needed, he could use them to boost his energy beyond the stats he lost. Even if the Dalki would no longer fall for his trick, he just couldn't see himself getting rid of it.

"I guess it's going to have to be the gauntlets then." Quinn sighed, but a thought came into his head. 'Does it have to be both of them? I know the gauntlets are a pair of weapons, but I can wear just one of them and still use their active and passive skills. In the first place, they were created with two Demi-god tier crystals. Maybe just giving one of the gauntlets would be enough?'

The only problem was, Quinn was a little worried that if he made the offering, then maybe he couldn't take it back. If that was the case, then he would have given up the gauntlet for nothing.

'What am I even worried about, I can just offer one, and if that doesn't work, the system would have taken them both anyway.' Quinn thought.

In the end, Quinn had decided to offer the poison gauntlet. Although the passive skill on it was strong. It was too unreliable, and there was only a chance it could work. Quinn needed something more sure rather than rely on luck or chance, so he decided to keep the energy draining gauntlet.

Picking up the gauntlet, Quinn started to think about the timer over his head. There was a ding sound and then a short wait. As if the system was trying to decide whether or not it would accept just one gauntlet instead of two.

[The item has been selected]

[Are you sure you want to give up this item?]

'Does that mean it worked?'

He didn't want to do it, but he had to select the yes option in the end. A few seconds later, the gauntlet started to turn into particles, disappearing the same way Quinn could store crystals.

'It is a loss, Quinn but remember you have gained a lot more from the system than losses. There might be a chance in the future that you are able to get the weapon back from the system.' Vincent said.

This was what Quinn was worried about as well. With the quest and stakes of the world getting harder and harder he had seen a penalty for the first time. Would this become a regular thing? If so, then if Quinn started to fail these quests more and more, they would only get more difficult.

Still, looking on the bright side, Quinn placed the energy drain gauntlet back in his dimensional space. It just meant he would have to get Alex to make him a new one.

'I was thinking. I know using blood crystals is considered taboo. However, you have already created blood weapons from the others in your faction.' Vincent was trying to get at something. 'When I saw them using their weapons and how effective they were against the Dalki, I was thinking, why don't you create a gauntlet out of the blood crystals.

'You have your soul weapon that acts in a similar way, and it gives you great power, but your soul weapon can only be used when there are multiple Dalki. If you were fighting against another five spike, then it would have been handy to have a powerful Blood weapon in hand.'

It was a good suggestion to make. However, Quinn didn't have a large blood crystal that he could use to create a significant blood weapon. He had already given all the blood crystals away, but even then, it was just better off for him to create beast gear that would give him more stats than a medium grade blood weapon.

'It would have been good if we had gotten Cindy's blood crystal back then. I doubt that Bryce has done anything with it. I'll keep it in mind if we ever do come across one.' Quinn said. Feeling a little bit better after only having to give up one of his gauntlets.

'I haven't heard from Leo and Erin in a while. It would be best to see if everything is okay where they are and how things are doing in the vampire world.' Quinn thought. 'I thought that there would be some type of reaction when we announced ourselves as V, but there was nothing at all.'

'I agree that is certainly strange.' Vincent said. 'I'm sure Bryce has his eyes on what you are doing. Although the situation was unavoidable, perhaps they had decided to let it go. Still, I actually prefer it when we know what they are doing good or bad. When things are silent, I worry the most. Especially since we haven't seen or heard of Arthur moving yet.'

What Quinn didn't know was that currently, Nathan was also on his way to Planet Caladi, and he wasn't alone. With him, he was travelling with Ruby and would be delivering the news of what he had learnt, as well as something special he had with him.

——

While Quinn had been busy deciding what item to give back, the rest hadn't been slacking off either. In particular, the Blade family. Other than Quinn, they were the second highlight of the war. In good ways and bad ways.

Since the world had learnt about them, their feelings were constantly changing. They hated them for killing Hilston, then thanking them for defeating the five spiked Dalki. The public felt like they were on a rollercoaster of emotions. After finishing helping build the Shelter, they were now helping out Logan with the ship's repairs.

It was good for them because they wanted to get away from the people in the Shelter. At the moment, they were having a break and were sitting down in the sand, where the ship was being used to give them all shade.

During this time, it was a little awkward between the group. There was Pai, and Vicky, the newcomers, who had decided to stay as they had nowhere else to go. It was actually an offer from Vorden. Then there was Sil, Raten and finally Borden as well.

Soon though, the silence broke as Pai asked Vorden how he and Raten had gotten into such strange bodies. The one thing they wanted to avoid was talking about Hilston.

"So that's what happened, you guys must have been on some crazy journey, and it must be weird having a beast as a body," Pai said, looking towards the two of them.

"What about this one?" Vicky pointed at Borden. "Why does he look like Sil, and is he a Dalki?"

"That…might be a difficult question to answer," Vorden replied awkwardly. Because then he would have to go into detail of how they had discovered a Dalki creating a lab on a vampire planet. In a way, too many crazy things were happening to them all.

"So, are you two going to stay with us, or are you just bored or something?" Raten asked.

Both Pai and Vicky looked at each other with a guilty look on their faces.

"We aren't quite sure," Pai said. "We think that we should help out with the situation as much as we can. To payback for what we have done, but we think there might be another problem that needs our attention.

"The Chained that were with us, all of them are free now, and that's not a good thing. Some of them have stayed in the Shelter and are going to be sent back to their families, I heard, but not everyone that Hilston kept with him was good. Some of them had dangerous abilities and were criminals.

"Hilston kept them for their abilities, but in a way, he was helping the world as well. People that could be considered for the position of the big four if they had the support and families to back them up. We might try going around and capturing them."

Hearing this made Vorden smile. He always knew that Pai and Vicky were good people. Even if they didn't stay with them, he wanted them to do things based on their own choices.

"Before you go." Sil finally spoke. "Tell me…I want you to tell me, why did Hilston…why did he do all of that, the Blade island, training us everything."

******

# Chapter 1246 - Unwelcome Face
All of the Blade's knew what Sil had said to Hilston before he had decided to finish him off in the way he had done. The video that had been recorded was watched by them all multiple times, not just by them but nearly everyone in the Shelter.

The drones had advanced technology that was able to pick up clear audio in a specific direction despite neither one of them not having microphones on their bodies. During the fight, Sil didn't exactly whisper the words to Hilston in his fit of anger either.

It was then that Sil had claimed that he didn't care about the reason Hilston had done everything, that no matter what, it wouldn't make up for the crimes he had committed, but after the fight, something had changed. It had to have for Sil to suddenly ask this question to his brother and sister.

This was due to the people around him, and not just any people, but those in the Cursed faction.

He wasn't lying when he said he wanted Hilston to be the end of his journey, of his saga. Now that he was gone, there was no reason to worry about what that man did or was ever going to do. However, walking back through the Shelter, there were those that hailed the Blade family as heroes, congratulating them. They were the ones that had defeated the five spike that no one else could, while at the same time, some harboured anger towards them.

Some of the Cursed members that Sil would walk past every day on the Cursed ship, were shaking when they would see him now. Hiding from his view while speaking whispers. It was clear they were scared of him.

Why were they scared of him? Sil started to think, and eventually, he had come up with his own answer.

It was the blood running through his veins, the Blade bloodline, the powerful ability that no one else could match up to. This family was the one that had attacked the Cursed faction, and what if it was to happen again.

After asking the question, there was silence from Vicky and Pai. This was what allowed the time for Sil to have these thoughts. He was thinking back to those that were shaking at the sight of him, so Sil spoke again.

"I…I just want to make sure that I don't turn out like him. I'm scared. I'm scared of this power. I'm scared of my body and all that training that we did. We all share his blood, don't we? What if there is something inside us that makes us become like him?" Sil asked, both of his hands shaking.

There was for a moment when he was fighting that he allowed the anger to consume him. It wasn't the first time he had this feeling which was why he was so concerned. He didn't want to admit it. Holding that much power gave a special feeling, something one couldn't explain.

"Haha, are you an idiot!" Raten burst out laughing. "Look at all of us, all of us carry the same blood, and every single one of us is different? We are all individual people regardless of what blood we have, and I mean, we're in freaking beast bodies at the moment. I'm not even sure if I have a spec of that dirty old man's blood in the first place. You are still a little child." Raten continued to laugh.

"I think what Raten is trying to say is, you really don't have to worry about that," Vorden added. "Just because of who our parents are, doesn't define who we are. You have a right to worry though because I too would like to know just what was that man doing, what was he trying to do."

Now, Vorden and Sil were waiting for an answer from the other two.

"Alright, would you two just stop looking at me like that?" Vicky said, scratching her head irritated. "Look, you aren't going to like what I have to say, but I don't have a clue either. When we joined the castle, all we did was follow what Hilston told us to do, just like you guys.

"From time to time, he would tell us to go places. All we did was fight, Honestly if you want to know more, then the one you really should be asking is our so called mother and father. They would have a better answer, but I have no clue where they have gone just like you."

It was disappointing for them to hear. Their curiosity was now consuming them. Their whole life they lived, there had to be some sort of goal, right? Otherwise, the lives of their brothers and sisters were lost for nothing.

"I do know one thing." Pai interrupted, and from the looks of it, Vicky was surprised to hear this as well. "I just heard the old man mumbling once, but the reason why he puts us through extreme measures again and again, why he keeps making as many Blade children as possible. Maybe this is linked.

"I don't know what his goal was or why he was doing it, but he was looking for a Blade, one that could use a soul weapon."

All of their eyes lit up hearing this, apart from Borden, who didn't have a clue what was going on and was finding it hard to keep track. Still, he was interested to learn of his brother's crazy family origins.

They were all surprised because they knew that Blade's were unable to have soul weapons. They had all tried to summon it at one point, and it failed. They thought that it might be due to how their ability worked, that it was just impossible for them to have a soul weapon. If they even had one, they would have no clue what it would be.

"Why would he be looking for a Blade with a soul weapon? I mean, I understand if he was someone who cared about the family, but I don't see how it benefits him at all." Vorden said. It certainly was a head scratcher, but they would just have to ask their mother and father to find out the missing pieces.

All of the communicators they had on them, given by Logan, started to vibrate again, signalling it was time for them to use their muscles and such to get back to work. Heading back inside the Cursed ship, Vorden looked at Sil from behind.

'Hilston was obsessed with getting Sil back. I thought it might have been due to him being able to hold six abilities, but what if it was because of a different reason? Is it true, can Sil really use a soul weapon? If so, it would be a big help to the war. Perhaps Sil is someone who can go even beyond Hilston, and we are going to need people like that if we are going to face more five Spike Dalki. The problem is, can Sil handle that much responsibility? Although he is the same age as us, he has been mentally hit since a young age.

'Only now has it started to get better, but as long as I and Raten stay by his side, we can keep him in control. Sil, we will look after you and make sure you stay on the right path, and if we aren't there, then I know Quinn will.'

———

Speaking off Quinn, he was now finally ready to leave the office. He had been sulking around for long enough about the penalty. In the end, it wasn't something he couldn't deal with. A loss of an item was something he could always get back, and his stats could improve.

His powers, Qi, skills he had learnt and experience, all of it was still there. Putting his plan into motion, Quinn had called Sam and asked him if he could require that all of those in the Shelter donate blood.

Quinn didn't quite explain the reason but said that he needed it for himself. The other vampires didn't get stronger by consuming different types of blood. This was something unique to Quinn, so it was hard to explain.

Luckily, it seemed like Sam believed that this wouldn't be too hard of a request.

'I can mix the blood into flasks and take them at the same time. My Qi has increased since the last time as well, and by mixing the two carefully together, I can make sure that the blood lust doesn't go out of control. It might take a while, but my stats will be back to what they were.'

Any second now, Sach and the others would arrive, and Quinn needed to be ready with a plan and what to do next. After all, even with the penalty, he was still one of the main powerhouses, and the Demon amulet could be put to good use.

Swinging the door open, Quinn was ready for a smile, but immediately, someone was standing on the other end of the door. His smile had disappeared.

"What the hell are you doing here?" Quinn asked.

"What a kind welcome, and here I thought you would be embracing me with a big hug. Did you miss me?" Richard Eno asked.

******


# Chapter 1247 - The Major Threats
It had been a while Since Quinn had last seen Eno. Still, it was a face that he wouldn’t forget for a long time. The last time the two of them had met was on Blade island, where they had decided to part ways. Honestly, when opening the door, it was the last person he was expecting to see on the other side.

Usually, others would contact Quinn when they wanted to see him, but Eno would just appear whenever he wished.

’How did he know where I was in the first place? How did he even know I was in this room? Does he have a tracker in my system or something?!’

The reason for Quinn’s unhappy appearance was because whenever this person appeared, he always did something that Quinn didn’t exactly agree with, which was why now, of all things, he was on his toes for what was just about to happen next.

"I saw the video of you. It looks like you have improved and exceeded my expectations like you have been doing this whole time." Eno said as he walked past him as if the office was his own home. "Although you could have made it easier on yourselves, you could have gone for the attack while Hilston was fighting. We might have just lost our Queen in this fight and traded for theirs.

"The problem is, they have more than one Queen."

Quinn understood that when Eno was using the words ’Queen’, he was referring to the game of chess. Where the Queen was the most powerful piece, but each side only had one. In this case, their Queen would have been Hilston.

As for the Dalki side, Quinn knew they had more than one five spike.

"How much do you know?" Quinn asked. "Do you know how many five spikes they have? Do you know about their strange chamber?"

There was clear information that Eno knew that he was keeping from them, but why didn’t he share this information with the human race? Wouldn’t they have a better chance of surviving if they knew?

At the same time, Quinn wanted to ask just what Eno was doing here, but while he was here, he might as well ask him some of the other questions he wanted to know.

"I think what you are asking for is fair, especially since you finally managed to defeat one of the major threats," Eno said, now sitting in the seat that Quinn was in before. "It looks like you have been busy yourself if you already know about that strange chamber of theirs. As you know the Dalki have been evolving in general, and it might have to do with the special chamber.

"At first, I thought that the Dalki would be the ones that were time sensitive, but now it seems the humans are."

Quinn couldn’t agree more. Although he was unable to experience the healing properties of the chamber, if what the five spike said was true, then Quinn could see them forcing evolutions.

"The major threats I speak of are as follows. There are three Dalki that can turn the tide of any battle and would be a huge blow if defeated to the enemy side. One Horn, who had managed to defeat Oscar, another five spike that goes by the name Graham, and lastly a Dalki named Green Horn.

"The last of the three is the weakest, only being a four spike. However, it is on the stronger side and is the closest to evolving at the moment. it also was the one that had escaped after fighting against Owen."

Thinking back to the five spikes that Quinn had met while being in a Dalki body, he could only assume that he was the one called Graham, since One Horn’s appearance was known to the whole place.

The next question for Quinn would be how did Eno know this information in the first place, but when asking in the past he got no answer. He assumed he was just being safe, not wanting to give his sources away in case anything happened to them.

"So, if we get rid of these three, the human race will win the war?" Quinn asked, getting a better idea of just what was left of this war.

"I haven’t finished naming the major threats. Jim, the ex vampire leader and ex vampire knight, also my, or should I say our relative is a big problem as well. In the past, he would do anything to please his curiosity and achieve his goal, and I’m sure it is the same now. There is no telling how strong he is or who he has by his side helping him."

When hearing this, Quinn’s mind went to True Dream and the one that was able to control the vampire agents. Two strong ability users.

"Lastly, we have to face the fact that Jim could be using Arthur in some way. Although we can’t be sure, he is working for Jim. There is a good chance whatever he is doing could get in our way. The important thing is Quinn, now that I have told you all our enemies we have to face, I’m sure you know, you can not beat them all on your own."

It was food for thought. Still, a part of Quinn didn’t believe Arthur had gone over to the other side. Otherwise, why would he have let him live? Arthur was almost telling him to get stronger, and there had to be a reason for it.

"Okay, then tell me why you came here. Aren’t you supposed to be protecting that Demon tier beast?" Quinn asked.

Standing up, Eno straightened his dark blazer and started to walk back to the exit where Quinn was standing.

"A meeting is to take place, no? The matter I need to bring up will concern everyone. As I said, if we want to survive this, we will need everyone’s help on this. Let me just say that this whole war is a distraction in the first place."

Walking out of the room, Eno continued to do his own thing, and as usual, Quinn was swept up in his pace. It was either that or leave the crazy old man alone. In a way, Quinn thought that would be worse. When stepping out of the office and heading down the hallway, he was quite surprised to see someone familiar standing there.

In a pointy hat, and black outfit Mona gave a little wave.

"I saw your flashy moves out there." Mona complimented. "You did a good job. I thought at first that maybe you weren’t deserving to replace one of the big four, and then in a flash, you go ahead and surpass us. Who would have thought."

For some reason, seeing Mona made Quinn a little at ease. He thought she was quite sensible, to say the least. If she and Eno were travelling together that she wasn’t shy enough to say if he was doing something out of order or strange. It did make Quinn wonder where Brock was though. The most likely answer was still on the island.

"It looks like everyone saw that video, huh?" Quinn replied, not realising just how viral it had gone.

"I would bet there isn’t a single human who hasn’t seen it," Eno said, clearing his throat. "Would you mind? These old legs of mine are getting a little tired."

At first, Quinn didn’t know what Eno meant by this. He was sure that his legs were working fine.

’Does he want a piggyback or something?’

Later he realised that Eno was trying to hint at them using Quinn’s shadow to travel. The meeting was far, and Quinn wanted to avoid the people outside, so he would use it anyway.

The meeting wasn’t to occur in the Shelter since there were too many people, and it would attract attention. Instead, it would take place on the Cursed ship. Although Repairs weren’t finished yet, the command centre had been repaired so they could have full use of it.

Both Mona and Eno were taken inside and out of the Shelter using his shadow travel. As they approached the Cursed ship, Quinn saw another ship had already landed while another was preparing to land.

Soon, Quinn could see who had gotten off the ship, for it was Nathan, along with a few others by his side. The others with him were just soldiers for protection, but Quinn didn’t recognise the person directly behind him.

It was a female, she stayed close, but he did notice something else that she was holding onto tightly. The next second, Quinn had popped out of the shadow, appearing in front of them all.

"Quinn! What the! You can’t just pop out of the sand like that. Were you hiding there that whole time!" Nathan had let out a little shriek. These days he was a little on edge and wasn’t paying attention. To suddenly see three people appear out of a shadow in the sand like that would give anyone a fright.

However, Quinn ignored Nathan and instead looked at the weapon held in the woman’s hands.

"That weapon that’s the Demon tier beast weapon that Oscar had! I’m sure of it!" Quinn said, recognising it. After all, he was one of the few that had seen it being used in action.

’Didn’t Sach say that they lost it when fighting against one horn, and it was on the planet where Arthur was, so why is it in this person’s hands?’

At the same time, while Quinn was thinking this. The woman who was known as Ruby also seemed a little starstruck after seeing Quinn.

"You, what you did just now, that looked like a shadow, do you have shadow abilities?" Ruby asked.

No matter what skill Quinn would use, even the shadow travel when deactivating and activating the skill, shadows would form like a type of purple fog and quickly disappear. Ruby had seen the same thing happen before.

"Do you know where Arthur is?" Ruby asked.

This girl knew who Arthur was? This was something Quinn wasn’t expecting, just who was this girl, and what was her relationship with Arthur.

******

# Chapter 1248 - Arthur switches Sides?
Hearing Arthur’s name was like a switch in Quinn’s mind. He never expected to hear the name from another person’s lips, especially a human. To make sure, Quinn sniffed a few times. The scent was definitely that of a human.

"Why!" Quinn said, pushing forward now almost directly in Ruby’s face. "Why do you know that name? How do you know him? Who are You?"

Asking one question after another, Quinn pushed forward, and Ruby was taking a step back. The person in front of her was being somewhat aggressive, and it felt like if she said one wrong word, she would be on the receiving end of an attack.

Instead of answering, she slowly moved her hands down to the hilt of the sword she had been practically hugging till recently, but this didn’t go unnoticed by Quinn.

"Don’t you try to use that weapon on me." Quinn demanded as his eyes glowed red and his influence skill had activated. No matter how hard Ruby tried to move her hand, her body wouldn’t listen to her as it was being controlled.

’Those red eyes are the same as Arthur’s. I thought that maybe the two of them knew each other. Is he going to kill me ?’ She thought.

"Quinn! What are you doing!" Nathan shouted out as he got in between the two of them. "Look, I don’t know who this Arthur person is, Ruby does know him, but you can’t just ask a question and put pressure on someone like that the second you meet them. You didn’t even give her time to answer.

"I know this might be out of place since I am ranked below you, but I have to call out your actions. Do you want to be like Duke!" Nathan shouted, trying to get Quinn’s head screwed back on properly.

Letting go of the Influence skill, Quinn took a step back. He realised that he had allowed his emotions to get the better of him, similar to when he had faced Head general Innu. This wasn’t Innu though, and neither was it Arthur himself.

’I have to calm myself down when it comes to situations involving Arthur. Every time I hear his name, the wounds on my body start to ache a little.’

"I understand the young one," Eno said, walking up to Quinn’s side. "I too am interested in knowing just how this girl came into possession of the Demon tier weapon and her relationship with Arthur."

It took a few seconds for Nathan to notice who it was, but it was then that he recognised the man as Richard Eno. Immediately he bowed down, showing his respect to one of the great heroes.

"I’m sorry," Quinn said, looking at Ruby again. "I’m just trying to find him and wondering what he is doing at the moment. Do you mind if you tell me what you know about him?"

Many things were running through Ruby’s mind when she saw Quinn use the shadow powers. Whether he was a friend of Arthur, an Enemy or perhaps someone who was just searching for him, but now she realised that they both had similar goals.

The group started to make their way into the cursed ship. While doing so, Ruby had explained just like she did with Nathan, who Arthur was and how he was introduced into the Shelter they had made.

’What she’s saying matches up with what Leo and Erin told me before, how they had trained with Arthur on the planet. So she is from the place where we woke up Arthur and must be part of those that were left behind when the portal planet changed.’

"So you don’t really know why the Dalki were protecting the place?" Quinn asked.

"I hate to say It, but it is looking more and more likely that Arthur is working for the other side now. He must have made some sort of deal to have the Dalki protect them. Arthur is a strong ally for them to have, which is why they went as far as to have One Horn keep their promise." After finishing this sentence, Eno had a smile on his face.

"However, in their rush to attack, you have managed to do a great thing. You have made it, so their deal is void."

"Who is this Arthur person you keep speaking of?" Nathan couldn’t help but ask. "From the sound of it, it is a great figure, but I have never heard of such a name."

"If I said he was someone who is stronger than Quinn, then I bet that would get your attention, so it is important to know if he is working for the Dalki or not," Eno answered.

Hearing this, Nathan stopped walking for a few seconds. Right now, it wouldn’t be wrong to say that Quinn was the strongest person in the world. At least, from who they knew, yet an unknown was stronger than him.

"Wait, but Arthur said, I mean Ruby said that Arthur said the Dalki were even stronger than him! What does that mean!" Nathan shouted out, recalling her words.

Now, both Quinn and Eno had stopped walking at the same time.

"It’s true," Ruby added, looking at the shock on their faces. She didn’t really know who this Quinn person was because they had been kept away from the outside world, so she also didn’t know what the big deal was that someone was stronger than him, or Arthur for that matter.

"When Arthur came back with the Dalki, he said those words."

Thinking things through, Quinn was trying to compare Arthur’s strength with Slicers. From both fights and what he had seen Arthur do before, out of a hundred fights with Slicer, Quinn couldn’t imagine Arthur losing a single one of them.

’Could it be, did Arthur already have a scuffle with the Dalki, did he lose? Is that why he attacked me that time with the Demon tier beast and told me to get stronger. Because not even he could beat the Dalki?’

This was the only thing he could think of, but to know for sure, he had to know the deal made with the humans. The only thing he could think of was if Arthur really thought the Dalki was going to win this war. His deal was for the Shelter to be saved.

Did he get attached to those at the Shelter so quickly?

"About what you said earlier," Ruby added. "Even if the Dalki aren’t protecting us anymore and we have escaped, I think Arthur would still help them because they still have my....daughter. Arthur and Minny, the two of them, would always go off together, but one day she had gone missing, and it was around the same time Arthur appeared with them. I know Arthur wouldn’t hurt her!"

Looking to his right, Quinn could see that Eno was in deep thought as well. Perhaps someone being stronger than Arthur was never in his calculations. Eno had the insight to see far ahead, but there were things even he couldn’t predict.

"What are you thinking?" Quinn asked.

"The timeline," Eno replied. "You see, if you asked me, could the Dalki get strong enough to defeat Arthur? My answer would have been yes, but judging by when these people were being protected by the Dalki, and when you claimed you were attacked by him. It would mean that at that time, they already had someone strong enough to deal with Arthur.

"If that is true and was the case, then that said person or Dalki is now even stronger than back then. The Dalki are improving quicker than my predictions. They might have a six spike already among them, or one that is very close to evolving."

It was a scary thought to even imagine what a six spike would be like. For the rest of the walk, there was silence among them all.

Finally, the group had entered the meeting room, where Logan and Sam were present inside. It looked like the command centre had not only been repaired but improvements had been made to the room as well. The main table that would sit a level above all the controls was now twice the size it was before.

The centre and the table itself could still be used as a holographic display, and it looked like it was being used as one now. Currently being projected into the meeting, was Owen, Helen, and Samantha. The holograms looked life-like as if they were actually present in the room.

From the smell alone, Quinn knew they weren’t.

In the room already, other than Sam and Logan, was the new Supreme commander Sach.

"Quinn, we were just talking about you," Sach said with a smile. "We were all discussing the video of you beating the five spike."

At first, Quinn thought that maybe the meeting had started without him, but it looked like everyone was just chatting and getting along with one another.

"Oh, I see you have brought some others with you as well," Sach said, surprised, but he wasn’t the only one.

"Mona, my word, I thought you had perished, darling," Owen said, spooked, thinking he had seen a ghost.

"I’m harder to kill than you think, and I have this person to thank for that," Mona said, pointing towards Richard Eno.

The group took to their seats now the meeting was about to start. Sach was going to take the lead, giving everyone an update on all of the current situations, but before he even could, Eno stood up.

"I have come bringing urgent news to everyone. This whole war that you are all facing, is a giant trap! The Dalki don’t care about the beast planets. This is just a distraction from their real goal. What they really are after, is planet earth.

"We have to do everything we can to protect planet earth, no more importantly protect Blade island. It’s time you all knew the truth about the Dalki." Eno explained.

******

# Chapter 1249 - Double Dalki
When Eno stood up and spoke, the rest of them were hanging on to his every word. There was something about the way he spoke, making them feel that it was of great importance, so they took everything he said seriously.

After explaining to the others that Earth needed to be protected, there was a bit of catching up to do for the rest of humanity. It was time that the World Leaders, the ones involved, and the ones that were risking their lives to fight the threat actually knew what they were fighting against and why.

Everyone in the room knew what Eno was since the announcement of V. Quinn was the one who had outed him in the first place, claiming that he was the reason the Cursed faction leader had been turned into a V. However, most of this had been said to Oscar, and they weren’t sure how much of it had been passed down.

Eno decided to start from the beginning, admitting to being a vampire for those that didn’t know in the room. Also revealing how the vampires had tried to create a blood substitute so they would no longer have to rely on humans, which was what led to the creation of the Dalki.

As someone in the know, Quinn could tell that just like himself, Eno made sure to withhold the fact that there were still plenty of vampires out there, inhabiting an entire planet even. The old man made sure to only share the information that was needed for his current story.

"As a failed experiment the Dalki are incomplete beings, their lifespan being short and finite. It is their goal to do everything they can to survive, and for that they require a Demon tier beast that is currently on Blade Island. They will come for it soon." Eno finished his explanation there.

Only a select few had known about the real goal of the Dalki, most had believed them to merely be a genocidal race who had out for humans. It was a lot to take in for the uninformed, but because it had come from the Great Richard Eno himself, nobody questioned the validity.

"This whole situation is so crazy." Samantha couldn’t help but blurt out.

"I have a few questions to ask if I may." Owen interjected. "First of all, why don’t we kill the Demon tier beast? That way the Dalki should have no more reason to attack Earth, right?"

"You make it sound easy." Mona laughed seriously at this suggestion. "We have already visited the island with a group of us and even Quinn admitted that it wasn’t anything we could just defeat. What’s more, that thing is... strange."

A realisation hit the others, if the Demon tier beast was too strong for them to handle, and the Dalki had decided to attack now, it must have meant they had a way to either control the Demon tier beast or were sure that they could beat it to take it back.

"Do we know how they are planning to attack?" Sach asked. "At the moment, the teleportation station is being heavily guarded. Although the Dalki have cornered us, they still aren’t close enough to reach the teleportation system to head to Earth’s solar system."

"That’s because it won’t be the Dalki that are attacking. I predict that they will have their hands full dealing with the humans, just like they have done now and that the vampire I spoke of earlier, will be the one to lead the attack."

"The V that is working with Dalki, he is a great mind like myself. Getting to Earth will pose no problem for him. I’m sure you are already aware that one Dalki has managed to appear on the planet, without any prior warning signs. You can be sure that more will follow."

It was an issue that nobody in their group currently had a way of solving. Even if the Dalki were after Earth, it didn’t change the fact that most of their forces were currently engaged with the Dalki on the beast planets.

At the moment, there was only a small group protecting Earth, and the wealthiest of civilians.

’Quinn, I’m afraid that the others don’t really understand the real threat in allowing the Dalki to obtain the Demon tier beast.’ Vincent voiced his opinion, while everyone was deep in thought, discussing measures and certain tactics. At the moment, they were estimating how long their forces could last, with the amount of beast crystal they had.

’Do you remember the state that Leo described the Demon tier beast was in? He said that it appeared to be in a deep slumber. From the information I have gathered and what I have observed I believe that this was the case because half of the Demon tier beast has already had all its energy drained.’

’The Dalki were created with one half of the Demon tier beast and Logan said that there wasn’t enough energy to create anymore Dalki after Borden, but the beast is still somewhat alive. If it wasn’t it would have joined back up with the beast on Earth.’

’If the Dalki get their hands on the second half of the Demon tier beast there will be two major issues. One, they could use the Demon tier that still has plenty of energy left to create more incomplete Dalki.’

’Two, their goal would change. Rather than capturing the other half of the Demon tier beast, they could simply slay the one on the vampire’s side, gaining control over the complete version of it.’

When hearing Vincent explain it, the terror of them getting the Demon tier beast set in. So far the humans were only able to put up a decent fight due to their numbers, but if their forces could double, there would be no hope for them.

"I agree." Quinn said, interrupting the others that were speaking. "We have to prevent the Dalki from obtaining the Demon tier beast at all costs. I’m aware that everyone is busy defending the invaded planets and that they are worried that if they leave them, there will be no hope for them to survive, but if we allow them to get their hands on that Demon tier beast they will be able to double their numbers, if not worse!"

There was something else Quinn realised that he decided to keep to himself as well. Arthur had made a deal with the Dalki, so what were they getting from him? If what Vincent theorised was true, Arthur might have been tasked with killing the Demon tier beast that was in the Vampire World.

"I see that you are all troubled so I have a suggestion." Sam spoke up. "The main issue we have at the moment is travel. The Dalki possess the technology to block our own teleporters. Were it not for that, we could assign people to protect Blade Island, and you could head back to your respective planets in case they would need the reinforcements."

"Thanks to Quinn and Logan, we were able to create a device that can be used to disrupt their jamming device. At the moment, the Dalki don’t know about it. This could be our trump card against them! When Eno calls for help from us all, we can travel and protect Blade Island!"

The others were amazed by how much the Cursed faction had been able to help in this fight. If it wasn’t for Quinn and his friends humanity would have long since perished.

"I can agree to that." Owen nodded. "As long as the Greylash planets and its people can be protected at any time, I will gladly go where I’m most needed. Providing the teleporters work of course."

Soon after, the rest of them agreed to this fact and a plan was put in place. For now, Eno, along with Mona, would head back to Blade Island and set up the teleporters. They would also stay there as a first line of defence.

Eno actually wanted Quinn to send some of his people back as well, but the Vampire Lord himself had refused, on the grounds that there were things he needed to do with them first. Seeing the look in his eyes, Eno understood that Quinn wouldn’t budge. Given the situation, it was apparent that Quinn must have intended to boost their strength as much as he could.

Up until now, they had done well and they had yet to let him down, so Eno didn’t insist on their arrival. The teleporters working was a big win for them. Additionally, Quinn did agree to send someone with the shadow ability over, so he could go there regardless if the teleporters were working or not.

"The next matter to be discussed is those that are known as the Chained." Sam stated standing up. "Hilston Blade has enslaved many strong people to have access to their abilities. A good portion of them have remained on Planet Caladi."

"Some of these are the strongest ability users in their field, including past leaders. They will be returned to their rightful factions."

Hearing this, there was a smile on Owen’s face. During the broadcast he had seen the face of his grandfather Grim Graylash still alive. Reclaiming those people who had been believed to have died, was a big win for the Graylash family as well as the Earthborn group as a whole.

"Before we go on to discuss each group’s plans and tactics for the fight against the Dalki, Nathan has one more matter he wishes to address." Sam sat back down in his seat to allow him to take over.

Nathan then stood up, with Ruby still sitting by his side.

"Supreme Commander Sach had given me an important mission while the attack was going on. With One Horn’s location having been confirmed on a different planet we knew it was the right opportunity to strike, and in doing so we rescued the humans."

While Nathan was speaking, Samantha suddenly sparked up, because she knew exactly what planet they were talking about.

"It turns out that the humans there had not been V at all, nor had they been working with the Dalki. The Dalki had kept them alive, glorified prisoners, probably to be used against us in some way." When Nathan said this, he was careful because he realised that neither Richard, nor Quinn had mentioned this Arthur person.

Since the latter seemed to be a V as well, he took that as a sign that it could be a secret they didn’t wish to share. As such, he chose to do the same.

"We have successfully freed them, and in doing so we have managed to retrieve this!"

Ruby, then placed the Demon tier weapon on the table for them all to see.

"Although it was our Cursed faction who discovered and secured the weapon, it originally belonged to the Earthborn group. Without Supreme Commander Oscar, we will have to choose the most suitable person to wield the sword for all of humanity’s sake!"

Everyone’s eyes were now glued onto the weapon. A Demon tier Weapon would be a boost to them all, and every single group wanted it for themselves.

******

# Chapter 1250 - The Board
The Demon tier weapon was special in more ways than one. Not just because of the rank of the weapon itself, but due to the history it carried as well.

As the first Demon tier weapon that the humans had owned and the one belonging to the supreme commander.

In a way, everyone in the room had a case for the weapon to be rightfully theirs. It was at that moment while everyones eyes were glued to the weapon that Ruby stood up.

"In return for saving those in the Shelter and giving them a safe place to live, I have agreed to give back this weapon. If it can help me bring back my daughter, and help save us from this war with the Dalki and many lives, then I accept." Ruby said, sitting back down.

Hearing Ruby’s words, and how selfless they had been, made the others reconsider for a second. A normal person had actually tasted what it was like to use and wield a Demon tier weapon. In times like this, nearly everyone would want to keep it for themselves. Her strong words resonated with the others and the first one to actually speak was Owen.

"At the moment, the Graylash faction lacks a Demon tier weapon. Our strength comes from our ability. I would have before said that using the weapon would have made it so there wasn’t just one strong contender in the Graylash family, but thanks to the Cursed faction that isn’t true anymore."

"I have them to thank that I will be reunited with my grandfather, Grim Graylash who is an even stronger lightning user than my father. He alone is worth more than a Demon tier weapon. On top of that I owe Quinn my life. Although I know handing the Weapon to the Cursed faction will make their power even greater than the others, I can’t think of anyone more deserving."

Of course, Quinn was also interested in the Demon tier Sword. Although it seemed rather selfish, he believed that in the Cursed faction’s hand it could be put to better use than if anyone else were to get it. He was aware that his own swordsmanship would be lacking, but Leo would eventually come back and he could do with a better weapon.

’Although it isn’t a katana blade so how would he fare with this type of sword, would it still be useful for him?’

"Honestly, I’m not completely against the idea." Sach said after hearing what Owen had to say. "Afterall, the Cursed faction was ultimately the one who dealt with the five spiked Dalki. Under the old system it would have made them eligible to demand any type of reward, given their contribution it could have even been the sword."

"However, there are a couple of problems. For one the Board wouldn’t exactly agree to such a thing. I know you guys don’t know much about them, but any major decision has to go through them. They are a group of ten families that in the past had originally supported the current military, especially during the first war with finances and more."

"The problem is they worry too much. If we were to hand the Demon tier weapon to the Cursed faction, I can already hear them complain that you guys will have a monopoly on power. Rather than thinking that we might not win this war and we should do everything we can to win this war, they are overly worried about themselves."

"Although it was thanks to them, and the seats voted that I am in the position I am in now, I just don’t think they would allow this to go through."

It came as a surprise to Quinn. Being in the position he was in he was unaware of how the military worked. The leader over the entire military in the public eye had been the Supreme Commander, which was why Quinn’s hatred for the old system had been aimed against Oscar. However, upon meeting him for the first time, he had felt that the old man had been far from the big villain he had pictured him in the past.

"Ah, yes that’s right, I was asked to put a vote in recently, I guess that had to do with you." Logan casually said.

Everyone’s head at the table, then turned to look at Logan. Without realising it he had just outed himself as one of the ten families that were on the Board.

"Wait, the Green family is on the Board?!" Nathan asked in surprise.

"Well, I can’t say it’s too surprising." Mona added. "Their systems are integrated into the military and they have money reserves beyond belief. Of course it would make sense for them to be on the Board."

What Sach didn’t mention was that the members of those ten families on the Board had been kept secret, for their overall safety. The reason why Logan had to give a vote was because his family was no longer alive apart from him. Sach cleared his throat, indicating that he had more to say.

"Regardless of this fact, I don’t think one vote would make a difference in this. The main reason I’m bringing this up is because of Samantha." Sach said pointing towards her. "It’s pretty much a given that the Board will insist that she has the right to the weapon more than anyone. Especially since it belonged to her father."

Thinking about this, Quinn was a bit troubled about taking the Demon tier weapon away from her. After all, Oscar had once told him about how much he and his people had gone through to obtain that thing.

"I also wish for it to go to the Cursed faction." Samantha finally spoke. "Honestly, even if it was in my hands, I am not confident that we can defeat One Horn with it. Then, there is even at least another five spiked Dalki out there, and unlike the Board who are unaware of what goes on, I do know it would be best suited in your hands."

With this, it seemed like the matter was settled. At least between all the World Leaders it was. Since all of them wished to hand the weapon to the Cursed faction. However, there was still the fact that the Board wouldn’t exactly be pleased with this outcome, putting Sach in a difficult position.

’What can the people on the Board do about it, anyway? They might not be happy, but are they going to force it from us? Surely, they can’t be crazy enough to start a fight with the Cursed faction in a time like this?’ Quinn wondered.

From the look on Quinn’s face Sach could tell what he was thinking.

"They have a great influence, Quinn. Just think about how powerful the Green family is. Maybe it won’t bother you, but they could easily turn public opinion against you." Sach said.

"That would be annoying, to say the least." Sam commented, but he already had an idea in mind. "How about this? Nathan is part of the Cursed group, and barely anyone should know that Sach was the one to have sent him out on this mission. Why not let Quinn claim to have ordered such a mission and that we coincidentally managed to retrieve the weapon?"

"This makes it so the Earthborn group is even more indebted to the Cursed faction. As a publicity stunt, Quinn hands the weapon to the Earthborn group Samantha, this will show that the connection between the Cursed and Earthborn group is close to those on the outside."

"Then, Samantha can just choose to give it back to us. Since it’s rightfully hers to keep, nobody should be able to complain if she does as she wishes, especially if it’s done for the sake of humanity."

It sounded like a long winded process but ultimately they believed that this would work and keep everyone happy.

Since this discussion had ended, it was time for the rest of them to talk about their situation on the planets, and what they had planned to do. It seemed like scuffles on the planets were happening every once in a while, but strong forces were no longer attacking like they had done before. This was good news and bad news, as the Dalki could be waiting for them to run out of crystals.

Due to the situation it seemed like each group would have to come up with their own defensive measures, which would be implemented on a case by case basis as and when attacks happened. What they did agree on was that they wouldn’t go on the attack. Not until they had successfully defended Blade Island from the practically guaranteed attack.

With that the meeting was over and everyone rushed off to do their own thing for now.

"Quinn, before I go remember what I said. You have done well so far and you need to continue to do so. I will also play my part in all this." That was all that Eno had to say. For the first time, the old man didn’t have any intentions of sticking around.

For now, the others were preparing just how they would do the handling of the Demon tier weapon. Sam was calling for Bonny and Void to hold a press conference, leaving Quinn to do his own thing. Sach would stay for the filming process before heading off back to Samantha.

Walking around the ship, Quinn was looking for a few certain individuals, and found them repairing one of the training rooms, the Balde family.

"Quinn!" Sil shouted with a smile, breaking his concentration, dropping a giant metal slab he was holding up with his powers, but before it could drop to the floor, Vicky lifted it back up and put it in place, for Borden and Vorden to do the rest of the repairs.

It was still weird for Quinn to see Pai and Vicky, the last time he had seen them he was fighting with his life on the line, but with Sil and the others there he felt safer. One thing he was glad about was that he wouldn’t have to ever fight them again. At least he hoped that would be the case.

After finishing the repairs, Vorden soon came over to Quinn, along with Borden and Sil. The others didn’t care for Quinn too much.

"So what brings you here, I hope you don’t need our help to take down another five spikes, I don’t want to do that ever again." Vorden half-joked.

Quinn laughed nervously, because in a way he did want them for something along those lines.

"Actually I have a gift for you guys. I know how much help I need from you and there might be a time when we all need to fight like that again. So I have to make sure that you guys are as strong as you can be."

Quinn took a step back and lifted his hands. Hundreds upon hundreds of beast crystals started falling onto the ground, piling up. All these crystals were from the mothership he had taken down.

"I doubt Muddy and Tails will mind, but I need their bodies to evolve!"

******

# Chapter 1251 - Blessing
When Quinn had first seen all the different levels of beast crystals on board the Dalki Mothership, the first thought he had in his mind was that he could use them to evolve both Vorden and Raten.

There weren’t any tier crystals beyond that of the king tier, so there was no need for them to be used as equipment. Besides, there was something better they could get out of it.

A Demon tier beast as an ally was unheard of. Even Mona, who was part of the big four, could only control a Demi-god tier beast. At the same time, it was beneficial for both of them as well. The whole world was currently in a war. In a war like so, people didn’t get to choose if they had to fight or not, they had to fight, and it was best if they had every chance they could at evolving so they could survive.

First up from the two of them was Vorden. He was currently an Emperor tier beast that could use the power of wind and had a fast agile body. As Vorden himself found out, the problem was that Emperor tier beasts were no match for the Dalki they were facing.

At first, Quinn had done a simple test. He had selected an intermediate tier crystal and allowed for Vorden’s body to absorb it. When using the inspect skill Quinn could see that his evolution percentage had gone up by one percent.

Selecting another intermediate tier crystal, Raten was asked to do the same.

"Come on! Wouldn’t it be better to just have me evolve?" Raten complained. "Surely one Demon tier beast would be better than having a legendary tier beast."

It was safe to say that Raten was looking forward to his evolution and what his new body’s powers could bring him. After absorbing the one crystal, Quinn could see that Raten’s evolution had only improved by 0.02 percent.

"You won’t evolve," Quinn said. "Even if we were to give all the crystals to you, you wouldn’t evolve. It looks like it’s going to take a lot to evolve you Raten."

Raten looked disappointed by the answer, but he didn’t think Quinn was lying. He hoped that even Quinn would know they needed a Demon tier beast more than anything after going up against the five spiked Dalki.

After absorbing close to two hundred crystals, Borden’s body was going through the stages of evolution. His body was taking some time to take in the energy inside him. Eventually, a bright white light was shining from his body. The outline of it could be seen slowly changing.

His black fur on his head started to grow even longer, now reaching below his waist, While the hair on his tails would rise up even more. Another strange change was his arms. The fur was coming out more so from it, nearly imitating tiny wings, and if one was to move the flowing hair going along his back, they could see the same.

Finally, the evolution was complete. Vorden was now at the legendary tier level.

"What type of beast are you?" Pai wondered as he got closer to looking at the details. "At first, because of the black fur and your forward like face, I thought you were some type of black wolf beast, but from your arms and small wings on your back. It looks like if you keep evolving, you’re going to like some type of bird beast."

"It’s stupid to try and compare beasts from other planets to the animals we have on earth," Vicky commented, pointing out the obvious.

"I don’t know when I will be able to get our hands on crystals like that again. Especially with the situation as it is." Quinn said. "So maybe this will be the level you are at for a while."

"I can only say thank you, Quinn. I know what the situation is like." Vorden replied.

Since Quinn realised that the reminding crystal wouldn’t evolve Vorden to the next stage again, they decided to use the rest on Raten. If they didn’t, they could just see Raten complaining the whole way.

In the end, after absorbing all of the crystals, Raten was now 60.42 percent on his way to becoming a Demon tier beast.

"You know, speaking of crystals. Hilston had a bunch that he never used, that were all aboard that ship of his." Vicky said. "After he got the Demon tier set, he wouldn’t accept anything less than that. So crystals would hardly be used. Although I’m guessing the ship is either in the hands of the Chained or Mother and father have it by now."

After saying the words mother and father, Vicky bit her tongue. She was trying to get out of the habit of saying those words, but after years of keeping up an act, the habit wouldn’t be broken overnight.

"Quinn, what are you planning for us to do now?" Vorden asked. "I mean, when the Cursed ship is repaired, do you want us to protect the Cursed planets?"

"No," Quinn replied. "I think if we send any strong reinforcements, the Dalki might think we’re prepping something and act out before then. At the moment, Sam is asking for small teams to be sent out to the three Cursed planets we have control of and setting up teleporters. The Dalki don’t know our teleporters are back online, so we can go and help them out whenever we want."

"What are you going to do?" Sil asked.

Quinn held the Demon amulet around his neck and thought back to his defeat in the Dalki body against Graham.

"I’m thinking of going to some of the planets that have been taken over....Alone." Quinn answered. "The Demon tier amulet was made into something special, and I can use its powers to help us out the next time something like this happens again. So tell me then, why did you ask, what do you want to do?"

It was clear there was something on their mind, and Quinn could tell they wanted to ask something.

"Well, we were talking about it, but we wanted to head back to Blade island for a while. There are strong beasts on the island that Raten and I can use to evolve, and we also want to find any hints we can to find the other two Blade members that escaped. At the same time, Vicky and Pai wanted to use it as a base to get back to while they search for the Chained."

At the moment, Eno and Mona were heading towards Balde island to reinforce it. At the same time, Dennis had gone along with them since he too had the shadow powers so Quinn could quickly travel there. He would also set up the teleporters so the world leaders and Quinn could get there at any time possible.

"I’m not going to stop you guys, you guys are strong, and I can tell you your family history is important to you guys," Quinn answered. "But I just want you guys to be cautious. Eno, the demon tier beast, are on that island, and there is a high chance that it’s the next place they will attack, but if they do, I will be there."

Vorden felt a little guilty about not telling Quinn the whole truth, as there was one more reason why he wanted to go there. It was to see if they could find anything on the fact that Hilston was trying to accomplish a Blade with a soul weapon. There had to be a method to his madness and something they might have missed.

This wasn’t something Quinn needed to concern himself with.

"Quinn, if you need any help, you can ask us as well," Sil said with a smile. He seemed to be recovering well after the fight and everything to do with Hilston.

It was a good thing that Vorden and Raten were by his side, and even more of the Blade’s with Vicky and Pai. They were able to just fill the family gap that Quinn couldn’t.

Leaving them be, Quinn had one word to say to them all.

"You guys, make a good family and one hell of a scary one." Quinn smiled, leaving the room.

Using the Demon tier amulet to obtain more Dalki and create higher spiked Dalki was Quinn’s goal. At the same time, he could use their exp to level up. Before he could go off the planet Caladi, he needed to wait for the preparation of the video that was to be made.

It was a broadcast to congratulate the Cursed faction while showing them giving the Demon tier weapon they had found. So before that, he couldn’t leave the base, but there was still one more thing he wanted to do anyway.

Heading to his own training room, Sam had said there was a nice surprise for him when he got there. Entering the pin on the secure door, he was let in, and Quinn could see five different flasks laying there on the ground.

The flasks that were used to hold vampire blood.

’Did he borrow the flasks from the others? I guess I’m going to have to give them back.’

Opening up the lid and using the inspect skill, Quinn could immediately tell all the different types of blood in the flask gathered. Drops from hundreds of people in each of the flasks from all those in the Shelter. From the people, he had never consumed blood from before.

’My Qi right now is stronger than my blood power. It was a problem before, but it can help me suppress the blood addiction more so. So I can take more drops of blood at a time. My control has gotten better, so this shouldn’t be a problem.’

Taking the first flask, Quinn started to drink it and got to work straight away. He could feel the red energy spiralling inside his body, but with how much practice he had done with his Qi, and his blood control having improved. It was almost too easy for him to get rid of the blood addiction.

What was difficult in the past was now simply effortless, and with the stat points gained, Quinn had a massive smile on his face as he figured out something.

’Wait a second, what is this! Why didn’t I think of this before? Maybe the penalty was a blessing in disguise. Perhaps this is a chance for me to correct my stats!’ Quinn thought as he went on to the next flask, and he could feel his body getting stronger by the second.

******

# Chapter 1252 - Stronger Than Before
Although it was easy for Quinn to remove the effects of the Blood addiction, it still took some time for him to complete the process for each flask. While doing so, he was thinking about the best way he could allocate his stats.

Most people’s blood type in the world generally had the O blood type. The good thing was that this particular blood type would give Quinn a free stat to use as he wished. Different blood types after consuming so many of the same blood type, would give him a stat in a specific area.

’Before every time I would level up, I would try to get my stats as even as possible. I thought being fast was just as important as being strong, and having the stamina to keep on fighting was as important as strength. However, after getting the legendary beast gear, things changed a bit.

’The stats gained from the set focused mainly on speed. Adding a few stats to my base points here and there isn’t really going to affect my speed much. I thought my strength was strong enough, but not enough to pierce the skin of a five spike. This time I know where to put the stat points.’

The penalty of course, still had affected Quinn. He had five fewer stats in every category, and if he was to do this, he still would have five more, but learning from the fight, he would now focus on putting his free stat points into strength.

In the end, after drinking the blood from all the five flasks, Quinn in a way, was actually at a stage where he was stronger than before the penalty.

[Strength 83]

[agility 72]

[Stamina 72]

[Charm 55]

Quinn realised that each flask had continued roughly the same amount of different blood in each of them. However, he would get fewer stat points from each one, as obtaining stats from blood was getting harder and harder.

His strength had been boosted beyond what it was before, while his agility and stamina were a little under what he had in the past. Hardly noticeable. The only stat that Quinn didn’t bother to increase was his charm stat.

In the past, he had gotten it up to the sixty mark, but with the opponents, he was fighting and the position he was in, there really was no need for him to use the influence power to such a degree anymore. The only way to also obtain a charm point was through a free stat by consuming the O blood type, and strength was a priority.

’This is amazing. Maybe I should start going to the Cursed factions and ask Helen and the others to do the same when I arrive. I’m sure they would understand, right?’ Quinn thought.

’It might cause some worry." Vincent said. ’I’m not saying that it will, but in the past, a long time ago, history states that there was a time that some vampires and humans tried to live together by doing such things, but it never worked out. Perhaps it will be different with you because you only require a drop of their blood and only once.

’Although I’m sure questions will arise with what you are doing with that blood between them. At the same time, your stats are properly close to their limit if I was to guess. Just like in the past with the previous evolutions, your stats stopped growing at a point.’

Taking Vincent’s word, Quinn thought he might be right. Would it be worth maybe upsetting this in the Cursed faction for a few extra stat points?

’Still, it’s got to be better than death. Maybe I should just ask Helen to prepare it beforehand. It still takes a few hours for me to go through the process and get rid of the effects of the blood addiction.’

Speaking of a few hours, Quinn just realised how long he had spent in his personal training room and was sure that the others would be ready for filming any second now.

——

The filming was to take place in the main Cursed ship hall, which had been cleaned up and down, scrubbed until it was sparkling. Decorations even filled the halls, with flowers and paintings Quinn had never seen aboard the ship before. Quinn was surprised at how much they had done while he was away.

Sniffing the air a few times, Quinn could still smell it though.

"They can clean the room, but they can’t exactly get rid of the smell of blood that easily, can they?" Fex said, coming up from behind.

Fex wasn’t the only one in the main hall. A lot of the Cursed faction members had been invited inside the Cursed ship main hall. It was getting quite packed.

"I thought this whole thing was just going to be a quick video." Quinn looked at the crowds of people and excitement on their faces. There was even a stage that had been built. It reminded Quinn of the other ceremonies he had attended, such as the crowing of the vampire king.

"Apparently, Bonny said it will look more like an award ceremony with more people inside. It’s got to look good for the public, ya know." Fex patted him a few times.

On the stage, Sach was standing there along with others, and it looked like they were going through a dress rehearsal. By his side was a holographic display of Samantha. Quinn would be ’giving’ the sword to Samantha while actually handing it to Sach on stage.

"Hey, how was she?" Fex asked.

Quinn was wondering who he was talking about, and followed where Fex’s eyes were looking. He could see he was staring at Samantha.

"Oh, you’re actually worried about her. That’s a surprise? I didn’t think she would exactly be your type. Isn’t she a lot older than you as well?" Quinn questioned.

"24, there’s only around a 6 year difference, some people I know have hundreds of years of difference, and it still doesn’t matter," Fex replied.

Quinn often forgot that Fex actually came from a different world. Although they were of a similar age, what was ordinary to him and ordinary to others was just two different things.

"Honestly, she seemed determined..but also something was still a little off," Quinn remembered back at the meeting. Although she had allowed them to have the sword, it didn’t seem like it was because she wanted the Cursed faction to have it, but because she was undeserving of it.

"I think she could do with someone by her side," Quinn said. "If you can hit it at the right moment and actually talk to her like you care about her, unlike all those other girls you talk to, maybe you two can hit it off."

"Hey, the day I start taking love advice from you will be the day you become the vampire king." Fex jokingly replied, thinking that both things were doubtful.

——-

Before the filming began, Quinn was instructed by Sam on everything that needed to be done. The main people that needed to be seen on camera were up on the makeshift stage, and the crowd watching were told when to cheer and clap.

It was different compared to when Quinn was being filmed before, but at the same time, there was less pressure on himself. This was because unlike all the other times he was on camera in the past, this was not going to be live. Bonny told Quinn that he could relax, and they could edit out whatever they needed to.

After filming for a short while, Void and bonny could be seen conversing with each other.

"He wasn’t in the rehearsal, was he?" Void asked.

"No, he just came now, and Sam told him everything that needed to be said. We have been able to do nearly everything in one take." Bonny replied.

"Well, I was checking out the script that we gave to him as a guideline. I didn’t expect him to, but he’s been able to repeat the words exactly as they were written one by one. If what you are saying is true, he must have an incredible memory and be a really quick learner."

Hearing this, Bonny looked at Quinn and remembered the words that he, or at least someone, had said to her as she left. That she should give up on him.

’Who could give up on someone like him.’ Bonny thought.

The Demon tier weapon being used was the real one, and the handling of the Demon tier sword was done so to Sach. Soon after, Samantha gave a speech about how thankful she was. Then it was Quinn’s turn.

Walking up to the stage, he was meant to say a few words about Oscar, but a message sounded in his head just as he did.

’This is an important message, being sent out to all those in the Tenth family. A council meeting has been requested. I repeat a council meeting has been requested. Please come to the meeting or send a proxy in your place.’

The message was sent through telepathy, and looking out in the crowd, Quinn could tell that Fex had received the news as well. The voice was familiar, and without a doubt, it was from Jil.

’A message from the vampire world, and to come back? What is going on?’ Quinn thought.

******

# Chapter 1253 - Disruption
The audience below continued to look at Quinn as he stood there speechless, unaware of the message that he had just received. It was only when he noticed Bonny and Void each giving him a pensive look that he remembered that he was about to give a speech.

Putting the content of the message to the back of his mind, Quinn finished the whole recording speaking his lines, like a professional actor would have, but as soon as the whole show was over, he disappeared to the side, followed by Fex.

"Did you receive the order to head back to attend a council meeting as well?" Fex asked to make sure.

"Yeah, and their timing could hardly be any worse. The planets are still under the attack of the Dalki and they won’t just stop if we’re gone. I have a feeling that it might be Arthur." Quinn shared his own thoughts on the matter.

Soon, all of the Cursed leaders could see the concerned look on Quinn’s face as he walked off to the command centre. They knew something was up and started to follow after him, waiting for him to tell them the reason for this sudden change.

"Sach, I’m sorry, but it seems like something has come up. I’m sure you can take the rest from here. You have been a big help to us and we’ll let you know if we encounter any other problems." Sam said with a nod and the Supreme Commander understood not to ask any questions.

Although a message hadn’t been sent out to him, the connection inside him had flicked for a second, almost resonating with Quinn’s worry.

———

Judging by the confused looks on the others’ faces it seemed like the only ones who had actually received the message had just been Quinn and Fex. Either Jil lacked a way of communicating with the others, or only those two were regarded as true vampires among the Cursed Faction. Whatever the case, Quinn quickly told them about the order.

"So they want you to go back, but they didn’t tell you the reason?" Sam asked after listening to Quinn’s explanation.

"Council meetings between the leaders used to be a rare thing, since the leaders could deal with their own vampires in their own families." Fex started to explain. "It was only later when Quinn and the worry of the Punishers was causing a ruckus that the Council would have regular meetings. If the Council is meeting up again, I can only imagine it is something serious.

"But Quinn there was something strange about the message. It said that you could send a proxy in your place. Do you think Bryce did that out of consideration knowing that you might be busy? Or do you think he just doesn’t want you to come?"

’Could this be an important enough matter to inform me that there was a meeting but at the same time he doesn’t want me to be present? But if that’s true, why even inform me in the first place?’

’I’m not sure how much the other vampires know about Arthur’s Involvement with Jim and the Dalki. Maybe he’s worried that me and Arthur are still close because we worked together in the past?’ Quinn wondered.

"I..I don’t think it’s a good idea for you to go." Layla spoke up. "Whenever we go to that place there always seems to be a problem that you end up getting dragged into. If it happens again, then that means if the Cursed faction or the others find themselves in trouble we won’t be able to help them!"

"Still, you have to keep in mind that no matter what, at some point the vampires will get involved in all of this." Sam added. "There’s no way around it, not with the other half of the Demon tier beast in their possession. The Dalki may be focusing on the one on Earth, but at some point they will go for one in the Vampire World as well."

Both of them made good points, and the group started to discuss amongst themselves what the best course of action would be. Given Quinn’s Shadow travel he could quickly get out if needed, but that would mean he would have to go alone, something the others weren’t too keen on.

After all, nearly all of them were now involved in the Vampire World, they too were considered vampires!

"Let’s contact Paul first. Maybe he has an idea why this meeting has been called." Quinn suggested. "Without knowing anything about the importance of the meeting, we might just be making a big deal out of nothing."

——

The call was being made to the other side and everyone was nervous as they could hear it ringing a few times. It not being answered right away was a sign that something serious must have happened, yet Quinn wasn’t too worried, for he had neither gotten a message nor a Quest from the System about anything happening to the tenth or fourteenth castle.

"I was expecting a call from you at some point, but it came earlier than I thought." A voice eventually answered from the other end. Hearing that Paul was the one that answered, all of them felt relieved.

"We just received information about a council meeting, I’m sure you have been reading the reports I have been sending out from here." Sam said. Sam thought it was important that Paul also knew the situation in the human world.

From time to time, Sam would also contact Paul asking him for advice on what tactics to use or implement. After all, Paul had more experience when it came to these types of things.

"Yes I have, so I understand you’re in a tricky situation. Let me get straight to the point then. The other day, the third leader was murdered. At the moment, there is no known suspect, but that has to be the reason for the meeting."

"Does it have anything to do with Arthur?" Quinn asked immediately before anyone else could say anything.

"Quinn, I fully know the situation over on your and our end. At the moment, there has been no signs of Arthur being involved. The way it happened, I’m not sure if it is something he would do, but the panic in place... From my point of view it appears that whoever killed the vampire leader, did so to create fear in the vampire community. If you wish, I can handle it, and I promise to inform you when it gets too much." Paul replied.

Honestly, there were more than a few reasons why Quinn didn’t want to return to the Vampire World just yet. If Arthur was really on the other side, what could he even do to stop him? As a Vampire Lord he had been unable to do much against a weakened Slicer on his own, so what chance would he stand against the original Punisher?

On top of that, there were still the Dalki Quinn wanted to mark to give him a boost whenever possible. Lastly, the Cursed faction leader hadn’t really gotten any closer to Paul’s own request about turning his men human again.

Paul was doing a good job, and it seemed like he was taking things seriously. Quinn was aware that his Vampire Knight wouldn’t blame him for not finding a way replicate something that only Vincent had succeeded in, in such a short time, but Quinn wanted to reward his diligence, feeling a little embarrassed that he had nothing to show for his time away.

’Quinn, I agree with you. Now isn’t a good time for you to return. It would halt all the progress we are making here at the moment. Besides, you could find yourself in the middle of a fight between Arthur and Bryce.’ Vincent said.

"Paul, I will leave things to you then!"

——

All the odd jobs that needed to be done had finally finished on Planet Caladi. Some of those that were in the Cursed faction had decided to stay on the planet, believing it was safer, while others decided to leave on the ship again now that repairs were done.

The idea was the Cursed faction would try to send support where it could not stay in one sector too long. The good news was that the teleporters that they had tested so far were a success so in reality they had a plan to support the Cursed faction and Helen whenever it was needed.

Aware about what was happening in the Vampire World, Quinn was more determined than ever before to get to work as quickly as possible. He left on a ship to the planets in the Earthborn group, hoping to fight some Dalki gaining exp and catching more Marked.

He chose those planets, to avoid meeting Graham again. After landing on one, it didn’t take long for Quinn to use the amulet powers obtaining his first Dalki again.

’Your power will become my power.’ Quinn thought, looking at the one spike. ’So I need you and the rest to grow as strong as you can as quickly as possible.’

———

Meanwhile, Graham himself had actually decided to move out of the Cursed faction planet area. Currently, he was in the Graylash faction, inside one of the Dalki motherships.

"The plan so far has proceeded splendidly. It’s over a bit quicker than we expected and now the humans are on the defensive. Now all we need to do is decide which one to attack first, I hope you won’t fail this time?" Turning around, Graham was looking at another green liquid filled container, and inside it was a Dalki that was heavily wounded.

It had slashes across its body, broken bones on the outside and ripped scales all over. It was clear the markings were not done by a human and looked more like one done by a Dalki.

"They got rid of a single five spiked Dalki and look how much they are celebrating. Well I wonder how they will feel once they see you. Don’t fail us for a third time, Green Horn, otherwise I will have to deal with it again myself." Graham said as the machine was activated and soon the Dalki’s body was starting to heal.

******

# Chapter 1254 - The Origin
Although Vicky and Pai had said they would be journeying around the beast solar system to catch the dangerous Chained that had escaped. They had decided to travel with the rest of the Blade family, heading towards Blade island.

Vicky and Pai needed a place to start and somewhere they could frequent back to. Although they were strong, the Dalki were still out there, and everyone had seen their faces on camera by now. They were no longer the Unknown Blade family, so the places they could stay without causing too much trouble were practically none.

Heading to the Blade island also meant the group would be heading back to Earth. Currently, all of the Blades were on a ship heading through the teleport station. All apart from the Blade children, they had remained on the ship. They would have liked to come but were told they were not allowed. It was a dangerous place, and possibly the centre of the next fight would be there.

Usually, the giant teleport station for ships was offline during these times of war. The station needed great power to be turned on again and would take some time.. However, because Eno and Mona were heading back to Earth anyway, they were able to travel through it shortly after them.

After that, the station would be closed once again. For fear, the Dalki could use it in some way. However, since the Dalki named Dred had appeared on Earth, and the fact that the V were able to hide amongst humans, they knew there was already a way for the enemy to arrive on Earth despite this.

The ship approached Earth with relative ease. The military that was in charge of protecting Earth knew they would be arriving. Still, at the same time, there was far more security compared to the times before.

It had to be due to the warning given by Eno. Sach had gotten to work quickly.

Flying outwards to the island, they could see it off in the distance. It was a place they once all called home. Yet, it felt like hell for them all. Seeing it was brewing some odd feelings for them all.

Sil, Raten, Vorden, Vicky, Pai and finally another who had come along with them all, Borden. He was the only one that didn’t have this strange feeling in his stomach.

———

Mona, Eno, Brock and Dennis had already set up base on top of the large Castle on the island itself. It wasn’t too far from the giant tablet. Even on top of the Castle, one could look out and see the tablet as well as the Demon tier beast that was still resting.

"That’s those Blade kid’s Sam talked to us about, right?" Mona said, looking at the ship land in the large open space by the giant staircase leading up to the Castle.

"Yeah, he said that they would be doing their own thing. We don’t have to worry about them. Remember, they were originally raised on this island, so whatever beast they run into, they can take them on." Dennis replied as he carried a large metallic object on his back.

"Now, tell me, where do you want this thing?" Dennis asked.

"The teleporter will need to be put in a safe place," Eno said while he was looking down. "We could either place it by the tablet or inside the Castle. I’m struggling to decide what the safe option would be."

"Oh." Mona was surprised. "I thought you were someone who had everything figured out. I’m surprised to hear you’re struggling with a simple decision like this." Walking over to the edge, she went to look at what Eno had been staring at for so long. That’s when her eyes could see what he was now looking at as well.

"Now you see my struggle. I’m pretty sure that wasn’t there the last time I came here." Eno replied.

———

Exiting the ship, the group of Blades decided to walk up the long staircase together. Step after step, they did so slowly. Not a single one of them was running up the stairs in excitement at all.

"Come on guys, you are really slow. Do you need me to pick you up?" Borden said as he jumped up to the next step. He was no longer in his full human form compared to before, so now he was as small as a puppy climbing the stairs.

Vicky, watching this, couldn’t help but stare in fascination and thought the whole thing was a little cute.

’This little guy was the same guy that was threatening us?’ Pai thought.

"Hey, why don’t you just stay on my shoulder for the rest of the way," Vorden asked. "You don’t have to tire yourself out."

"I’m not tired, and you know I like to do things for myself. Besides, you guys are clearly worrying about other things. That Hilston guy you were all scared of is gone! So I don’t know why you are all acting like he’s still alive. This place used to belong to him, well now it’s all yours." Borden shouted back as he continued to hop up the stairs, getting ahead of everyone else.

"Damn it, how can that little runt be so right! I can’t believe I was feeling this way and hanging around with the loser bunch." Raten said as he ran ahead, catching up with Borden.

For the others, they looked at each other and smiled. Borden’s words had picked them up a little. It was just so hard to believe that Hilston was gone. Any second, when they opened those doors, they were expecting to see Hilston on the other side.

When the others had finally reached the stairs, they could see the doors wide open, but there was no ’Family’ that was there to greet them like there usually would be.

The inside of the place was empty, feeling emptier than usual.

"We came here last time, but we were unable to find anything other than a journal," Sil said. "Quinn has the journal at the moment, but other than all the ability users in that journal, it didn’t seem to have anything else inside. Do you think we’ll find anything this time?"

The reason they had come here was to perhaps learn what exactly Hilston was planning if he really was looking for a Blade with a soul weapon and why.

"Last time, you didn’t have Pai and me." Vicky proudly said, walking in front taking the lead. "You have to remember, we left with Hilston when he decided to go after you guys, and you three were young, so they didn’t exactly show you all the places in this Castle. What do you think is under the giant staircases in the first place?"

Thinking about it, although the Castle was on a type of Hill, the staircase and Castle seemed to be at a higher level than others. It was starting to make Vorden wonder, by Vicky’s words, if they were man-made.

With a strong Earth ability, one could landscape the whole area to their liking.

’Is there something underneath the castle?’ Vorden thought.

Following Vicky, she had eventually led them to one of the training rooms they all remembered well. Above reinforce glass could be seen. When looking, Vorden had memories of the tests he had been put through.

At the time, they were unaware that Raten and Vorden were in Sil’s mind and were trying to force Sil to use his six abilities again. So he fought against a dangerous beast in this chamber, hoping to draw out his power.

Vorden could see a younger version of himself in Sil’s body fighting for his life.

"Sil, although you had the power to wield six abilities, your body never did quite go through the change that Hilston wanted for you, unlike the rest of us. We were able to achieve superhuman bodies, but you weren’t. We all saw Hilston losing to that five spike. I’m not telling you to continue that training again now. Still, if you are going to go up against the Dalki again, maybe it would be a good idea to practice in this room from time to time." Vicky suggested.

Hearing this, Sil thought they were right. Sil knew that if he was to fight Hilston head on, or Slicer that he wouldn’t have survived, which was why he had taken advantage of the situation in the first place.

However, thinking about training in this place again made him think of the temple and every bad thought that came with it.

"We can do that somewhere else," Vorden said. "It doesn’t need to be in this place. We are just here to find out more about Hilston and get some crystals."

Turning around, Vicky headed to the centre of the training room.

"You know, you can’t keep protecting him like that. It’s because of you two in the first place protecting him that he hasn’t been able to grow.

Pai had pressed some buttons on the monitoring machinery by the side of the room, and a steam-like substance started to appear out from the centre of the room. Then a circular platform could be seen.

The group walked on the platform, and soon it started to sink into the ground like an elevator. The first things they could hear were the cries and shouts of beasts.

"Where is this place taking us?" Vorden asked. Worried that they were heading into a trap, but what reason could Pai and Vicky have for doing that now?

"Don’t worry. It’s a separate storage place that Hilston used and was where the strong beast you used to fight with when you were younger were kept. Honestly, without being fed, I’m not sure how they were able to stay alive this long."

When the evaluator finally stopped, the door opened, and two people could be seen standing in front of them. Immediately all of them were ready for a fight.

"Mother! Father!" Vicky shouted.

******


# Chapter 1255 - Fake Family
Looking around at their situation, Vorden was trying to figure out what was going on. Whether their group had been led into a trap and now Vicky and Pai would be turning on them with their mother and father.

With the four of them, it would be a difficult fight for them to get out of.

However, judging by Vicky and Pai’s quick reaction and genuine look of shock on thier face, it seemed like they had no idea what they were doing down here either. Because of this, the instincts in their bodies had fired up and were telling them to fight.

Vicky was the one who acted first, throwing out a punch. It was soon not only blocked by her mother but also for it to swiftly be knocked away. After, she pulled her arm and put Vicky in a type of lock around her neck so she wouldn’t be getting away.

Pai, seeing her sister in trouble, also quickly went in to help. Still, before he could do anything, he felt a kick to his knee and his upper body falling before he was grabbed and turned around, being held from behind with both of his arms held back..

He tried to kick behind him, but they were hitting nothing but air.

’His strength, he’s so much stronger than me.’ Pai thought, attempting to break free.

If a normal civilian who had seen the video of the Blades fighting had seen this, they would be wondering just what was going on. Neither side had used a single ability. Surely in such a situation, they would have used one.

The reason was simple, they had no ability to use, because of the amount of time that had passed.

The Blades hadn’t brought any ability users with them, so they had no powers to share. In the first place, they didn’t want to drag anyone who was uninvolved in the matter. It also felt strange to carry an ability user with them just to use their power. It was a disgusting feeling, and it reminded them of the Chained, which in turn made them think of Hilston.

This was why Pai and Vicky were unable to use their powers.

It turned out, it was the same for their parents, who had been in the castle for an unknown amount of time. Even though all four of them had super bodies, they lost out in skill and power when it came to their older parents.

Regardless of their situation, both Vicky and Pai had a smile on their face because they weren’t panicked at all. For there were those with them that didn’t need to use any abilities at all, and even when they had thier abilities, they had put up a good fight against them.

"Let go of them you two!" Vorden shouted.

Their father made sure to point their bodies in the direction of the beasts in front of them, using them as types of shields.

"If we do, then it will leave room for you to attack us. If you take one step closer, we will finish them. We have the strength to do so." The father said.

"Do you think I care!" Raten screamed, charging forward. Vorden wanted to hold him back, unsure if their threat was real, but it was too late. The speed of the Demi-god tier beast was great, and Raten was directly behind the two of them, with two mud blades pointed towards their back.

"Stop!" Sil shouted, and the mud blades had stopped before they pierced their flesh.

’Damn it, my body listens to Sil. All those years spent being in his head, it was like my mind acted on reflex.’ Raten was complaining and ready to attack again, but by then, both parents had let go of Vicky and Pai.

"I can tell. They don’t want to hurt us. They’re just like us. There is no reason for us to fight." When Sil had said these words, everyone there realised it was true. For some reason, they all thought they were against each other when their eyes met.

It was either them or us mentality, but was that really the case? Even the parents hesitated whether it was right to attack or not, but started to defend themselves when they saw the others coming towards them.

"We didn’t come here to fight." The male Balde said of the two. "We didn’t even expect any of you to be here. Please let’s just talk things through. Remember, we too wanted to let go of this dreaded life."

The fact that all of them had experienced the same thing, and the cause of all their problems was one person, it felt like they could tell when and if the other person was telling the truth or not and at the moment, they felt like they were.

’Seriously, one family member caused this much trouble for all of them. Just what did Hilston Blade do to them all.’ Borden thought, as the group now were accompanied by two more members of the Blade family.

Instead of calling them father and mother, they had introduced their given names to the rest of the group. The mother Blade, went by the name Tina, while the father was named Kane. It turned out that the reason for being in such a place was to pick up a few items from the storage room.

"There are a lot of items in this place that weren’t good enough for Hilston, but we left them down here, of course."

The group was currently walking through a dark tunnel, lit lightly from small embedded light crystals in the ground. However, they didn’t provide much light at all for the group. The Darkness made it hard to see and was adding to the spookiness of the place.

What would have been even more heart-pounding for some was the sounds that they could hear throughout. The snarling and banging noises that would ring through the tunnels.

The ground was flat and well made but seemed like it was done using an ability. Since it was made from the same material as the ground itself, rather than some type of metal.

Where this was different was the side of the walls. There were metal bars similar to a prison cell, but they weren’t ordinary cells or bars. These were around ten meters in height, from the ground to the ceiling, and the bars were made from Glathrium.

Looking through one of the cages, Borden could just see glowing eyes staring back at him. Still, when Raten looked at several of them, they could be seen backing away and going silent awfully quick.

"Haha, look at those weaklings." Raten laughed. "They’re scared of me, aren’t they? Just wait until I get your crystals and grow even stronger."

Of course, those in the cages were beasts of high tiers, but Raten himself was a beast that was even higher than them, and they could sense that. They weren’t willing to anger the beast at the cost of their lives.

"When we heard the elevator activating, we knew someone was coming down here, so we went to take a look, but we just never expected it to be you guys," Kane said.

"How, how did you get here, aren’t there others that are meant to be protecting this place," Vorden asked.

"Brock let us in," Tina replied. "You know we have a good relationship with him."

Vorden thought it would have been nice for Brock to at least meet them and inform them that there were other Blades on the island or in the castle. He must have known how sensitive the situation would have been between them all.

Finally, the group had reached the storage room. There was no door or anything of the sort for protection. Like most things on Blade island. Because no one would even think of betraying Hilston while being on the island.

It was just one large empty circular room filled with Crystals and beast equipment that had been forged. Piled on top of each other as if they had no importance. The things in the room would have caused factions to have wars over.

They could even see the armour that had been given to the other Blade’s who worked on the island here or used to work here.

"Well, this doesn’t really help us all that much apart from the crystals," Vorden said, having a look and feeling a little upset. In the past, while having a human body he would have been far more excited to have seen such items.

"You know, there are certain beast crystals that can be forged and work on Beasts as well. So I wouldn’t be too upset." Tina said.

The group started to search the room. While Tina and Kane stood by the side. They had already got what they wanted from the room, but that’s when they noticed that none of them were happy with what they were finding, as if they were after something else.

"Nothing, there is nothing," Sil said, disappointed, kicking a piece of armour away. There was nothing about Hilston Blade, so what would they do now? Looking towards the two that were with them, now they were Sil’s only hope.

"Did you not find what you were looking for?" Tina asked.

It certainly was a big haul for the group, and when they left the place, Vorden could inform Dennis of what they found. It could be put to good use for the war.

"Actually, we were looking for information about Hilston," Vorden said. "If we couldn’t find anything here, like we have done, the next thing we were actually going to do was ask you guys.

"Why did Hilston make us all pretend to be a family? Why was Hilston desperately searching for Sil and making so many...children! Why put us through all that!" Vorden asked.

The two of them stayed silent for a while until the answer had finally left their lips.

"This is probably what you didn’t want to hear, but we don’t actually know the answer," Kane replied.

At that point, Sil, Vorden, Pai and even Vicky wanted to fall to their knees. Having come on this journey with them, their curiosity soon started to grow as well, but the last people that perhaps would have known an answer, didn’t have one for them.

"They might not know, but I do. For I have been with Hilston, even longer than he has known himself." A voice said, entering the room. His face came into view, and they could see that it was none other than Brock.

"Do you really want to know everything there is to know about the Hilston Blade?"

# Chapter 1256 - The Creation Of The Blade Family
*****

Seeing Brock standing there for some reason he didn't look too out of place with the rest of the Blades, despite the fact that he was actually a vampire, but then it hit Vorden. The reason he didn't look out of place was because Brock wasn't.

Ever since Vorden had been in the family he had known Brock, for he had been the Head Butler of the entire castle. When the others had found out about him, Quinn had updated them on who Brock really was, how he had been working for Eno and through the years of working for the Blade family would constantly change his appearance.

Since he had always been part of their life, none of them had ever asked themselves the question about just how far back Brock's history with the Blade family actually dated?

'It would make sense that Brock started to follow the Blade family after they had settled on the island or once the Demon tier beast came into play, but if he really knows that much about the Hilston Blade's past, could it be possible that he was following him even before that? But why?' Was the question running through Vorden's mind?

Of course, Kane, Tina, Vicky and Pai were left quite confused as to why the Head Butler would know more about the Blade family than themselves.

"I want to know, Brock please if you can, tell us!" Sil requested…

Sil didn't care why Brock knew, he just wanted answers.

"Then let me start from the beginning of Hilston Blade's life. He might not have looked like it, but he has lived for far more years than any of you might imagine. He has long since gone beyond the limit of a regular human, in more than just one sense." Brock started to explain, but even his first words were confusing for the Blade family.

What did he mean by this? The only beings able to outlive normal humans they knew of were vampires, but Hilston had never shown any signs of being a vampire whatsoever. The more they heard the more questions they started to have, but Brock's demeanor made it clear that he wasn't about to stop until he finished answering Sil's request.

"When I start my story, the beginning of this tale might sound awfully familiar to some of you. For you see, Hilston grew up without any family. As an orphan, he had been unaware of any other living relatives and during the time period he had been born into, it had been nearly impossible to trace back or find out who his true family were."

"Growing up, he had been bullied by those around him that were of a similar age, and he had no support whatsoever. The only thing he had been able to do was steal and fight to survive. However, as a small child there had been many others who had beaten him once they had caught him, stealing what little he had."

"This continued for nearly his entire childhood life until someone had come into his life, a stranger had decided to pick him up. His days of being beaten and bullied had suddenly been over. No longer had he been forced to steal or rummage through bins for stale food, able to enjoy his life for the first time. In fact, it was that person who had inspired him to take on his last name."

"After pampering and looking after Hilston for two years, he had kicked him out of the house. This had come as a shock to young Hilston, who had done no wrong. He had been ready to dedicate his life to the person who had gotten him off the street, wondering why the man had suddenly abandoned him?"

"Hilston had begged and pleaded to at least get an explanation. After waiting in front of his benefactor's door for a week, the man had eventually opened the door, telling him a few simple words: 'Do you know why those other people kept on beating you? It was because you were weak. If you wish to return to my side, then become a Blade that I can use, one stronger than any other.'"

"These words had sprouted in his head as he had received kindness for the first time since he could remember. Young Hilston had been unable to understand the meaning behind those words at first. No matter how many times he came back and pleaded to the man, he would beat him and leave him barely alive."

"One day, while following him, he found that the man had picked up another young boy. One that was similar in age, and was treating him with the same kindness that he had received. 'Why, Why does that boy deserve that man's kindness and not mine, is he stronger than me?' was Hilston's thought.'"

"This was when Hilston started to go down the dark path, he wanted to prove to the man that he was stronger, and in doing so he had brought back the body of the boy that the man had looked after in his hands to his door."

"Usually people would be frightened by this fact, would have called the child a demon but instead. The man smiled and took in the boy encouraging his actions. Perhaps Hilston thought that would be the end of his troubles, but once again the pattern had repeated. Hilston was kicked out again and sent away, the process repeated itself with Hilston proving he was stronger than the others he was replaced with, until a boy who had been taken in his place, had an ability."

"Remember, abilities existed before the Dalki war. They were rare but people either kept them secret or taught them within their family line, but it seemed like even this boy was unaware and the man wanted to grow it once again."

"I could imagine the thoughts going through Hilston's head at this point, that he was weak, he needed to get stronger so the man, the only person who had accepted him, would take him in. Once again, Hilston set out to kill the new man's favourite boy, but with an ability how would he fare?"

"It was only then that Hilston had discovered while fighting his opponent, that he too had an ability and it was the same as the boys. This was the start of the Blade family ability. One would think he could finally live in peace with the man as he had always wished for but instead he had become paranoid."

"He had already experienced being replaced by some stronger than himself and it was not a feeling he wished to relive. Hilston grew a strong body by training day and night with this fear, and even if he was to meet other ability users, his ability and body put together were strong enough to combat theirs."

"As he got older he no longer needed to rely on the man but stayed as a close acquaintance until he eventually had raised a family of his own. Eventually his wife blessed him with a beautiful child, a boy. The man that had taken Hilston in was treated by him like his father, and one day he had come over as a grandfather to play with the boy. Then at a certain age, Hilston's own son was known to have an ability, the same ability as himself, only it was slightly better than his."

Listening to this part of the story, Vorden thought it was similar to all the Blades' today. Their powers varied in how many abilities they could carry. Still, he let Brock finish his story.

"The mysterious man frequently visited their household but instead of paying attention to Hilston he only had eyes for the boy."

"So many years had gone by with no problem whatsoever, that nobody realised that the true fear had struck in Hilston once again. 'What if that man was to stab me again?' He did what no father would have ever done, and just like many times in the past. Hilston had proved that he was the Blade that the man needed, not his son."

"You see from his Dark past I can only fill in the pieces of what else I know. The man and Hilston at some point separated, but his desire to please this person had never left. The Blade family ability has one crucial weakness, and that is the fact that it requires other abilities in order for its powers to be used. Otherwise it only lasts for twenty four hours."

"Coming to this realization Hilston became obsessed with growing stronger and he couldn't stand this one weakness. He believed that the answer was in the soul weapon. He had seen through his family the ability grow stronger. So perhaps there would eventually be one with a soul weapon that could cover for this weakness"

"But why did this benefit him? Without realising it, through the years Hilston had been able to gather abilities that would slow down the aging process, heal his insides wounds and disease , and also was able to obtain a superhuman body where the cells aged at a slower rate, but even all of those things wouldn't explain how he had managed to live for so long."

"The answer, you two might already know for yourselves." Brock said, pointing towards Raten and Vorden. "If you haven't guessed, he used the same ability that the boy Shiro has, and transferred his mind into theirs. Swapping bodies and killing his old self inside. Whenever he found someone stronger than himself this would repeat this pattern. So now you know the reason why Hilston was obsessed with getting Sil back."

"As for why he asked you all to be treated as a family I do not know the answer. Maybe it was because he never had a real family growing up. Or perhaps it was due to him trying to forget of the perfect family he had in the past that he himself had ruined. Perhaps running away from this all, but that is everything I know about Hilston Blade."

The others were left speechless not knowing what to say. However, it left a lot for them to think about, in particular Vorden was struggling with the story that Brock told for a few reasons. How did Brock know so much detail about Hilston's past from when he was a child?

The way he spoke about Hilston's thoughts were certainly strange and it sounded like it was more than just Brock's assumptions. Lastly, the scariest thing about the story was the mysterious man.

The man who had turned Hilston into the monster he was today, it almost seemed as if his actions had been intentional. It was a scary thought that there might be a person out there who was more cruel and messed up than Hilston Blade.

Vorden just hoped that this person was no longer alive.

# Chapter 1257 - Ramblings Of A Mad Man
After witnessing what was out there from the top of the Castle, Eno, Mona and Dennis decided to head down and check out the tablet and Demon tier beast. As the one who had to transport the heavy portable teleporter, Dennis was lagging behind the other two. He had the strength to be faster without tiring out, but since he had been told that it was sensible equipment he was nervous about tripping on some root or such.

’I just wanted to enjoy some quiet days with Megan, yet here I am stuck with people I don’t really know. ... just gotta remind myself that I’m doing this for everyone and that includes Megan. If we don’t do what needs to be done then the whole world will suffer.’ The vampire thought to himself, elated that they were getting closer to their destination.

As they went through the Castle, Brock who was originally with them decided to split off. There hadn’t been any words exchanged between Eno and Brock which Dennis found a little weird, but decided to ignore it.

He wondered what could be so strange that it had caught the attention of the other two, but before he had the chance to get a proper look at it, they were already back on the move. Finally they could see the large tablet. The loud snores coming from the Demon tier beast were frightening in itself..

"Hey, this beast, it really doesn’t attack us right?" Dennis asked in a low voice.

"I don’t know, to be honest, I was passed out for the most part last time." Mona shrugged her shoulders. "Apparently Quinn talked to the tablet or something and whatever’s inside made it so the beast agreed not to attack us. Let’s just hope our stay here won’t disturb its slumber and it will recognise us even without Quinn by our side."

That didn’t sound very convincing, so Dennis decided to follow the others a few steps back, so he could get a head start if anything was to happen.

’Should I just start setting up the teleport here and now so I can use it if the beast attacks us? The beast should be too large to get through the teleporter... right?’ Dennis thought nervously.

However, going up the slight hill, the pathway started to level out and that’s when he could see what they had all been staring at. Dennis hadn’t been part of the group last time, not that they had come to Blade Island for sight-seeing, but it was certainly eye catching.

The ground was mostly flat and towards the back was a giant tablet that looked like a small mountain. Then off to the side of the tablet lay the Demon tier beast, but none of these things had caught Dennis’ eyes or the others, it was what laid in the centre.

A human sized tree with pink flowers. The pink colour radiated and when staring at it, Dennis felt like he was so at peace.

"That thing definitely wasn’t there before." Mona said.

"Yes, and it resembles something that I have seen before elsewhere." The tree reminded Eno of the Demon tier beast that Quinn had ultimately defeated only smaller in size, but what was it doing here?

Eno was the first to walk up to it, unafraid, yet he gave a hand signal for the others to stay back. If it really was a sapling of that Demon tier tree with the same abilities as the other one, there was a risk Mona and Dennis would be Marked, and Eno still had a use for them.

He was confident in his own powers and skills to fight off such a Marking. Walking close to it there was no such reaction at all from the tree, making Eno wonder if it was even a beast at all. When he finally got within touching distance he quickly placed his hand on the tree.

’This certainly is confusing? Is it a beast or is it not? It’s almost as if the crystal in its body hasn’t finished forming. These days I keep running into things that I am struggling to make a decision on. However, if it was a threat then I’m sure that the other Demon tier beast would have gotten rid of it. Maybe we can use this, and if it does evolve into a Demon tier beast that would be another great thing to have.’ Eno thought.

"Okay I’ve decided, place the portal near the tablet. The Demon tier beast is protecting the tablet, so I don’t think it will let it come to any harm." Eno turned around to address the other two. "The castle is a standout landmark, so they might go for it first. Not that the tablet isn’t but I’m sure the tablet will be kept in good condition."

Listening to Eno’s commands, Dennis got to work setting up the teleporter. While making his way over, he had activated his shadow, to cover the side view. Dennis wasn’t someone that was often afraid of beasts, but how often had he had the chance to come close to a Demon tier beast?

Just being near the thing made him want to turn around and escape as far away as possible, so the only way to work properly was to pretend it wasn’t there. He paused every time the Dragon let out a loud snore, afraid that it would be a sign of it waking up, but fortunately, each time nothing happened.

Eno had decided to stay by the tree, observing it closer, which left Mona with pretty much nothing to do. Once the teleporter was set up she wanted to explore Blade Island further, looking for any other beasts that she could put to use.

They needed to work out their defences for protecting the place, but she hadn’t left yet and couldn’t stop looking towards Eno. Eventually she walked up to him and said what was on her mind.

"Hey, old man. You’re actually a vampire, right?" Mona asked. "I was thankful for you saving me back then and looking after me which is why I haven’t said much but I just am trying to understand your actions a little more."

"You must have seen a lot of crap throughout your life, and it’s clear you’re no ordinary vampire. I understand why Quinn is helping us since he was originally human, but what about you? Why are you doing so much for us humans?" Mona asked.

Hearing this, Eno stopped what he was doing for a second and looked at Mona. He wasn’t staring at her but instead was staring directly behind her as if he was thinking about something.

"You know, it’s been so long I often forget the reason why I do this." Eno answered with a slight smile.

Mona thought at this point that Eno was pulling her leg, if he didn’t want to tell her, he didn’t have to, but he could just say that instead of making up a bad excuse like that.

"However." Eno continued. "Whenever I think I’m starting to forget I decide to head back to a certain place. That reminds me of why I do everything I have done."

"Us vampires have a history that nearly dates back as far as humans and it wouldn’t be the first time my kind would have wiped out an entire race, which everyone else eventually forgot about. I fear that history is repeating itself and the same thing might happen again."

After seemingly having said his piece, Eno looked back at the tree again and Mona didn’t feel any wiser as to why this enigmatic old man was on their side. Just as she was about to head off and do her own thing, thinking the other two would be fine without her, Eno continued his answer, having placed a hand on his chin.

"No wait, I don’t think that’s quite right either. The original reason why I wanted to help you humans has changed as time passed. You don’t need to have lived as long as I have, to have experienced it.

Your views change drastically from when you were 10 to when you’re 20, from when you were 20 to when you’re 30 and so on. So imagine how many times my views on the world have changed."

"My reason for helping has changed, sometimes subtly, sometimes drastically. Even now I am finding new reasons to help out, but I will say one thing, Mona. In the past I have been able to help out people, letting humans avoid their death and end by helping here and there."

"Perhaps my actions are similar to those gods that don’t wish to get involved too much, but this time it appears that if I don’t get involved that there will be a real end. During the first Dalki War I have merely helped from the background, so getting involved to this degree, poses a huge risk to my own life. Something I never even considered before."

"Perhaps, I shouldn’t even be telling you these things, but I am because there is a chance that I won’t survive and will never be able to answer your questions again. I tell you what, why don’t you come over here." Eno suggested.

Mona had asked that she had considered one simple question, she hadn’t expected the old man to go on rambling, and the way he spoke it was as if he was forgetting what he was saying the moment he said it.

It was actually making her reconsider if they should really put so much hope into this so-called great scientist. Still, she honestly was indebted to this man, and if he wanted to harm her or turn her she would at least let the man have that much for saving her life.

Walking over, Mona felt a little nervous and at unease, she always did around Eno, despite him doing no harm or showing any immediate red flags. When coming over, Eno grabbed her hand and placed a small little circular digital device with a star as its base.

"It’s a lock that is linked to my heart. When I die, or my heart stops beating, that will open up. It’s a small map which will lead you to my special place. If you go there, you will find things that you will need at the time. Remember, I am always planning ahead." Eno stated with a smile.

’How can he talk about his own death so easily? Is this why I can’t shake the dark feeling I get from him?’ Mona wondered.

# Chapter 1258 - The Worst Century Yet
’The worst century yet’ was a phrase that had started to become common in the vampire settlement these days. Vampires used to live without much grief or problems, whether one looked at it internally or externally.

Of course there had been the occasional disputes between the families, but those had usually only affected the families in question. Yet somehow one problem seemed to follow the next one, affecting vampire society as a whole lately.

Despite the new King having been crowned not too long ago, a new council meeting was to take hold soon. However, this time the public was very well aware as for the reason behind it.

When Suzan’s body had been seen, the news had spread so rapidly that every single vampire had heard of her demise before her body could even be taken down. Not only had a leader been killed, but it had happened in her own castle where she had gotten pinned to the wall.

What made matters worse, was the fact that the vampire settlement shouldn’t be under any external threat of any kind. However, the signs were all pointing that the attack had to have been done from someone externally, so fear was growing in the vampires, especially for those in the third family that had just lost their leader..

Paul, having been given the okay from Quinn, had gone out to attend today’s council meeting in his place. He arrived at the King’s castle, where the Royal guards were guarding the entrance. Some in the public were shouting, demanding explanations given the recent event. Unlike humans, even regular vampires had great power, but the Royal guards made sure that things remained civil.

Any leader was allowed to attend with their two Vampire knights, yet because Paul himself was a knight and Leo being here was a secret, he had decided to bring two replacements with him, Timmy, and Xander.

He had left his second in command Ashley behind since he felt given the nature of the council meeting, actual vampires who knew more about how things worked in the Vampire World, would be better suited.

The two were over the moon when Paul had selected them, thinking that their hard work had paid off. At the same time they were nervous, since they understood the difference in standing between themselves and the others who would attend.

Even if they weren’t in the tenth family, the other knights and leaders would look down on their group when they entered the room, for they were in a place and a position that would perhaps be undeserving if they were with any other family.

Now standing outside the council door, Xander and Timmy took a deep breath.

"Relax, it’s unlikely we will be much involved in the meeting. As such, I just need you to listen and pay close attention to the reactions of the other leaders. Should the need arise, I will be the one talking. Honestly, the goal for our family is to try to stay out of this matter as much as possible."

"As long as it doesn’t involve us there is no need for us to help any of them out." Paul explained, but his mind went back to his talk with Muka. About those in the other families that had gone missing.

He was still wondering whether these two matters were related in some way. If that turned out to be the case, then there might be a need for them to get involved, even though he didn’t want Quinn to worry.

The two guards that were standing outside, opened the doors wide and allowed them to walk. Another guard led them to the council room and when he opened the door, the trio was surprised that it was in absolute chaos. The other leaders were in the midst of discussion and it looked as if everyone else had already long since arrived before them.

The only ones that weren’t present yet were the King and his two Royal knights.

"Everyone, please quiet down!" Kazz demanded. As the current head of the first family it was usually her job to get the leaders under control, but most of them didn’t acknowledge Kazz as a true leader. After all, once a real first leader would be selected her position would go back down to being a Vampire knight.

For a second, her and Paul’s eyes met, but they soon looked away from each other again.

"A leader was killed in their own home! There wasn’t even any sign of fighting, so who else could it be if not HIM?!"

"We need to find out the reason why they were targeted. Whoever has done this clearly wanted us to see what was going on!"

"Suzan was no weak leader and there were no signs of fighting in her castle. She might have been attacked by her own people. I demand that we interrogate their knights!"

The reason why there was more chaos than usual was also because there were many new vampire leaders in the room. After Bryce’s election and his selection of Royal knight, there had been a need to fill the void.

However, soon everyone went silent, as the sound of a clacking cane could be heard from outside the room. The sound of the clacking was getting louder and louder and one could tell it was filled with anger. The doors were swept open from the other side, the side only the King was allowed to enter from and signs of his red aura could be seen.

Bryce was there with his eyes glowing red and the energy could be felt from every single one of them in the room.

’He has gotten a lot stronger and more confident than before.’ Paul analyzed. ’Is this just because of the Absolute Blood book?’

"We should have known this was going to happen. When we knew of HIS existence we should have gotten rid of him immediately!" Bryce spat out as he walked to sit down on his seat. Behind him were Prima, the fastest vampire ever known, and Kyle the vampire with the strongest defense.

"In the past many of you didn’t believe me that he would be a threat to us and would bring doom to us all. There is only one person who is strong and capable enough to not only infiltrate but kill a leader without anyone else noticing it. The Punisher, Arthur!"

The vampires knew Bryce’s strong feelings towards the Punishers, but the fact that he had indirectly allowed Quinn to do his own thing, and had said nothing about Arthur up until this point had made them assume he had decided to let the matter go, yet his reaction made it clear that it was a mistake on their part.

"Forgive me, Your Majesty, but what makes you believe this is Arthur?" Jin asked. "I don’t know of a reason why he would return and attack us now of all times."

"You know that all of the Punishers of the old died, so it’s only natural that he is blaming us for this." Bryce replied. "Is there anyone else who would be so daring, who would be capable of such a feat? There were no signs of fighting whatsoever, which is proof in itself that the Shadow power must have been used!"

Xander and Timmy continued to look around at the Vampire leaders and knights checking if there was any sort of reaction at all like they had been asked. Strangely they didn’t even have to look hard, for it was visible on some of their faces.

There were vampires that were panicking about the situation, visibly shaken up at the thought that Arthur had returned.

"Although I do think that the most likely person is Arthur, I also think that we shouldn’t rule out any other possibilities." Sunny commented. "After all, none of us have suspected Cindy behind all those wrong doings not too long ago."

This was a recent memory that they wished to forget but it was true. Her betrayal had made it abundantly clear that it was possible that a traitor could be hiding amongst them.

"Now is not the time for our council to sleep and point fingers at each other." Prima stated. "We shall act under the assumption that the Punisher Arthur is back. Everyone should be putting in measurements in place, to capture the culprit and protect themselves and their families."

Looking towards Paul, Bryce had an evil glint in his eyes. "With the absence of the Cursed family’s leader, I hereby call for a vote. I suggest forbidding him from returning to the settlement until this matter gets resolved."

This came as a shock to Paul. He had never expected them to go this far. With this abrupt change, he could no longer just sit around and stay silent.

"May I ask for the reason behind such an action?" Paul inquiered, having raised his hand before speaking out of turn.

"While I’m not accusing Quinn of being involved in this attack, we know that Arthur has come to his aid in the past when he had been in trouble. As much as his help may aid us in this time, as the one who had inherited his shadow power, having him amongst us, would be the same as inviting the Punisher into our midst. He could just strike us, and run away whenever needed." Bryce explained.

The Vampire King didn’t hide his disdain for the tenth family’s leader, yet the logic behind his suggestion was sound and that was a problem. The council got to voting quickly, and even the vampire leaders that had been on Quinn’s side in the past ended up voting to have him stay outside, afraid that Arthur might be behind it.

"The original Punisher. I do remember he had great power. Are you sure we will be able to deal with him?" Tempus asked.

The vampire spoke without any formalities, which rubbed the other leaders the wrong way a little bit, but as an original vampire he technically outranked them all, allowing him to get away with certain things.

"I have a little suggestion with who or how you could solve this problem of yours. Many of you probably know that your ancestors including the originals can only be woken up with blood from your own blood line. However, for the originals themselves there is one other way."

"The blood from another Original also works." Tempus revealed with a smile.

# Chapter 1259 - Unsettled
Tempus seemed like an easy going leader for an Original. Ever since he had been put in charge of the second family following Cindy’s betrayal, he had done well to reformat and implement changes. It turned out that there were far more underlying problems than the others had originally thought.

Under Cindy’s rule, the men of the second family had been discriminated against. No matter how much promise they might have shown, most had been put aside, never receiving a promotion to the inner castle. As for those, who had actually received that highly sought after promotion, they would disappear, having actually been sent off to be tested and experimented on.

Cindy had been far crueler to her own family members than anyone had realised, having attempted to forcefully create a blood fairy. To achieve her goal she had made use of her own ability to revert the changes over certain vampires. It was an amazing feat, only possible due to her great proficiency in her own ability, yet it had been an unimaginable torture for her people, one that would repeat over and over again.

There had even been a few humans that had been captured, once turned into a subclass, if it was one she hadn’t been expecting she would revert the change and go through the process again. As for the captured vampires, it was to raise an army of Bloodsuckers. Tempus had shed light on this mistreatment, quickly abolishing this favoritism, making him well liked amongst his people.. Of course, the other leaders didn’t mind him too much because he had chosen to not get involved or complain about the other families like the other leaders did.

However, if there was one thing they could complain about, then it would be how frequently he visited the King, and the other leaders believed that the new king and Tempus were playing favours due to him being an original.

This was the main issue. Tempus was an Original, one of the first thirteen that had created the families in the first place. He was a figure that was meant to be well respected, which was why nobody thought he was joking with his idea of reviving the others.

Not only that, but the big question was, why mention this fact. Even Bryce was struggling to understand.

’There are still vampires from all the original thirteen families.’ Bryce thought. ’So all of the past leaders and originals can be awakened without using an Original. So then why has Tempus decided to reveal this fact to everyone?’

’Is he setting a trap? Did he intend to lure someone into using his blood to awaken the others? Or is he simply threatening them, stating that he could awaken the other Originals whenever he wished?’

There were many possibilities, and the smile on Tempus’ face was annoying even to Bryce, but he did well to hide it. Tempus was a good ally to have, and at the moment he couldn’t afford to make any more enemies.

However, there was one other possibility, one of the vampires that couldn’t be awoken by the current vampire’s bloodline. At least there was no way of knowing whose bloodline would work when trying to awaken them, and that was the True First King. The original owner of the Shadow ability.

Only a handful of leaders at the table knew about the True First King, since the rest were too young and all mentions about him should have been removed. The rebellion had been caused by the other leaders. All of their powers had been used to take him down. Ultimately, they had been unable to kill him, only able to force him into a deep slumber.

His bloodline had been fully erased in order to prevent him from ever waking up again, his family line replaced by another.

’Is that why Tempus has brought it up? But without his shadow powers could he take on Arthur? Is he saying the First True King is even stronger than me with my Absolute Blood Control? That has to be impossible!’ Bryce believed and tried to disregard his suggestion.

"To make sure there is order among the third family, they need to select a replacement leader as soon as possible." Bryce stated. "I’m sure Suzan already had someone in mind to replace her. Until then, her knights will have to take over her duties."

"We will need to spread the message that our people have no need to panic. Arthur has no interest in them, he is only after us leaders. Is there any more concerning matters?" Bryce asked, scanning the room.

At this point and time, Paul was debating with himself what to do. He was sure based on Kazz’s reaction that the missing vampires had something to do with the first family and most likely the King.

’Should I bring up the matter here in front of everyone? With Arthur as a distraction, maybe they have yet to realise that their vampires have gone missing? I could also say it is out of concern for what is happening now. If he says something out of the ordinary maybe we can use this little slip up of his.’ Paul thought about his next move.

Having made up his mind, Paul raised his hand, but a stare from Muka quickly made him put it down just as quickly. Alas, Bryce had already looked over and despite his dislike for the Cursed family, for appearance’s sake he had to allow him to speak, especially on the off-chance he had something worthwhile to say.

"I’m sorry, it was an itch, I do not have any questions." Paul quickly made up an excuse, looking down. Bryce gave him a strange glare, but ignored that remark.

With nobody else having anything to say, the King declared the council meeting to be over, and the leaders were to head back to their respective castles to do as they wished or as they needed to. The tenth family was naturally being most affected by this.

’I should tell Quinn as quickly as possible about the matter. If he comes here, they will accuse him of working with Arthur which will just put the tenth family in a worse situation. Maybe their desire to keep him away might actually be for the best for us." Paul thought.

Walking to his castle, he asked Timmy and Xander if they had noticed any strange reactions among the other vampires. According to the duo certain leaders had a more shocked reaction when hearing Arthur’s name. Truth be told, Paul hadn’t really needed them to keep an eye out, for it had been obvious on their faces that he already knew the answers about the vampires involved.

’Out of the newer leaders there were two of them. The new sixth leader, Harlow Muscat and twelfth leader Kim Killton. Then of the current leaders, both the Royal knights, Prima Killton, and Kyle who were by the King’s side.’

The ones Paul was unsure about though, were the second leader Tempus as well as Jill, the ninth family leader. Since her family no longer existed, her face was like that of a ghost’s these days, making it impossible to read through. Finally, there was also Kazz, as Bryce’s daughter he was unsure how deeply involved she was in the whole mess.

It was during their walk that Paul noticed they were being followed, not just by anyone, for even when they entered the inner tenth area. He had found that the person had gotten in without any of the guards noticing.

Paul eventually told Timmy, and Xander to go to the castle ahead of him, stating that he was going to meet up with Ashley and get a few updates. Soon he took a turn between two large mansion’s where the light of a beast crystal was unable to hit, and he could see a large figure in front of him.

"I figured it would be you." Paul sighed.

"I’m sorry for my behaviour, but I can not be seen meeting with you." Muka explained. "Tensions are high right now as is. I also apologise for making you hold your tongue earlier, but it was neither the right place nor the right time."

"I know the attack shows signs that it was done by Arthur, but it’s also possible that someone has done this to rally us up against him before he even arrives. Had you brought up what we have discovered, then I’m afraid that you might have been the next one-"

It was at that moment, that Muka turned around, and Paul was ready for a fight, as a third person revealed themselves.

"I....I’m not here to fight." The female voice quickly declared. When seeing who it was, Muka was still on guard, but Paul dropped all intentions of fighting.

"You know then, Kazz?"

"I told you not to investigate this, but instead you decided to team up with other leaders about this matter?" Kazz’s voice was filled with anger.

"Vampires might have a different opinion, but when it involves my people I can’t just sit by them. Today it might be one or two men whose names I might not even have heard about, but tomorrow it could be those I really care about. Turning a blind eye is not my way." Paul stated.

Muka was starting to understand the situation, but what he didn’t understand was the close relationship Paul and Kazz apparently had with each other. Why would the first family leader go out of her way, to tell him not to get involved?

’Perhaps, we can use this in some way.’

Hearing Paul’s words, Kazz stung a little inside, but it also gave her the determination to find her answer.

"Before you say anything, let’s get inside. If it would be disastrous when two family leaders get seen colluding, I can’t imagine it getting better with three." Paul suggested, before heading towards the castle.

The other two agreed, and took to the shadow of the buildings to scale and enter the castle from one of their windows, which led into Paul’s office. He often left it open so he could enter this way, but it was at that time that he didn’t expect to have two others waiting for him there.

"You, I thought you had returned to the Human World!" Kazz exclaimed.

"Whether I am in the Human World or not, I don’t think that matters now." Leo replied with Erin who was standing by his side.

Muka looking at the both of them noticed that despite being in the presence of powerful vampires the girl looked unafraid, if anything it looked like she was ready to take them all on at any second.

"I’ve come here to warn you that the Dalki have appeared on this planet!"
