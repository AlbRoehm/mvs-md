# Chapter 1630: The Little Talent
Instead of Peter, it was Lucia summarising everything that occurred after Quinn went into the beast wave. She told him about the arrival of Vicky and Jake after he had left, and how Peter had changed his form and almost gotten in a head-on conflict with Jake until Vicky interefered. Though, the most interesting part for Quinn was Peter's transformation.

At first, he thought she had exaggerated what had happened, but that didn't seem to be the case.

'So just like the others, it seems like the celestial energy allowed Peter to transform, and that was only with three points? It sounds like there was a significant boost.' Looking at Peter, his form was back to normal; at least the disguise was the same.

It was one of the worries for Quinn since he had never seen someone revert to their original form after using celestial energy other than himself because he had killed all of the other ones, apart from Laxmus, who had run away.

'I wish we were alone because there are so many questions I would like to ask. Other than a physical appearance, what other effects did it have, and why were Peter's changes different from the others that just turned into giant monsters?'

While the others continued to brief about everything that had happened, Quinn's heart sank a bit when he had heard about what had happened to Minny. Although, looking at her, she seemed to be doing well, as she was still smiling away and playing with the other Red Vampires, who seemed gentle with her as if she was glass. Even if she was annoying them somehow, everyone made sure not to hurt her because there were two people who were sure to act if anything happened to her.

'What is wrong with me? She's not even my child, and I'm acting like this? Is it because I feel guilty about what's happened to her mother and that I haven't told her the truth...I guess she is my responsibility now.'

The second the two made eye contact, Minny came running over towards Quinn and opened her arms for a hug. In doing so, Quinn too spread out his arms and lifted her in the air, swinging her around a few times in circles.

She screamed with joy before Quinn eventually stopped as he noticed he was perhaps going a little too fast and had even made a dent on the ground.

"Ahh, come on, you can go faster than that; I know you can, and I can take it!" Minny cried.

"That's enough for you; I heard you had been doing some dangerous things," Quinn said, finding it hard to plainly properly tell her off because he was pretty impressed that such a young vampire could produce a blood rifle. It certainly was something that he would never have been able to do.

'It's called talent.' Ray replied.

Quinn ignored the comment from the voice inside. It seemed like Ray wasn't having a hard time with the other two dhampirs in captivity. If he could still tell what was happening on the outside, then it meant he must not have been having too much trouble dealing with them.

Anyway, Minny certainly was someone Quinn needed to watch out for, and it would be best if he kept an eye on her. Perhaps she would be able to unlock the abilities of the shadow in the near future.

The group, of course, had also asked where Quinn had gone and what he saw, to which he replied that he thought he had seen some greater beasts up ahead, but it seemed like his eyes were playing tricks on him.

The Red Vampires didn't even believe this lie, as even the other vampires in the Corps units were talking about how there was meant to be a final wave that never appeared. The question was, did Quinn defeat them or not?

'These vampires there are clearly not normal.' Derik thought. 'I'm starting to wonder if it would be best to make them out allies or to have nothing to do with them… I wonder what Hannah is thinking. Maybe it would be best to contact our leader for a decision. Hannah's judgement clearly is being a little...misguided by something.'

It was then, at that moment, that Quinn had received a notification from his system.

[A follower has completed the condition for this month]

[1 additional celestial point has been granted]

[17/20 Cleistal energy]

For a second, Quinn was quite startled. Although he had told Mitchell to do such a thing, he wasn't expecting him to do something like this so soon and even wondered if the latter would accept such an abnormal condition.

'I guess he really does want to follow me...vampires are a little strange.' Quinn thought. Either way, his experiment was a success, and now he knew that the best way to get celestial points and the easiest was to complete the condition.

At the same time, as soon as Quinn had gained the celestial point, a special feeling overcame his body. It was a powerful and sweet sensation as if he had tasted something for the first time again. It was the same sensation when he tasted blood for the first time as a vampire.

'This felt good; I might get addicted to this. Fortunately, I'm not craving such a feeling, perhaps because I'm used to suppressing myself the same way with blood, but that's because I have only been gaining a few points at a time.

'What if a big amount of celestial energy was to come to me at once? The system stated that for my condition, they would have to do this once a month. If that's the case and there were many followers, the feeling would be quite overwhelming.'

If this feeling were what the other celestials craved, then it would be better for them to complete the condition altogether.

'I have finally reached twenty points but still haven't levelled up, which means I still require many points to get to the next celestial level. So far, this celestial system hasn't been the best other than making Peter stronger. Which perhaps is why the other celestials give out their energy more freely.'

"Attention!" A Corps member shouted from a distance facing all of the vampires that had gathered. "Everyone is to head to the assembly hall inside the base for a briefing on today's events. There will also be announcements, contribution rewards and more. Your Lieutenant will give you your next instructions, so stay with your Lieutenant unless called up by them or a higher ranking individual."

After the announcement was made, all the vampires readied themselves and did as instructed to follow their respective Lieutenants. When Quinn met eyes with Mitchell, Quinn nodded his head at him with a slight smile to indicate he was happy with what the latter had done.

Mitchell caught the sign, wondering how this vampire could possibly know, but it made his belief even stronger that this vampire was indeed special. Still, there was a concerned look on Mitchell's face for some reason.

Everyone was in the hall, standing in their groups and on stage, all the Lieutenants and General Yaddy.

'Has Vicky already left…I wanted to ask her a few questions. I will need to find out where she has gone to get some answers.' Quinn thought.

General Yaddy had started his speech, talking about how good they had done in the Horde attack. He then took some time to speak and mourned about the lost lives of the vampires. There weren't many, but it looked like one or two vampires had been hurt too much before Jake and Vicky could arrive.

At the closure of his speech, General Yaddy looked towards Quinn and the others.

"Finally, there are those who contributed the most in this horde attack, and I would like them to be invited up on stage for all to see. After all, it was because of them that this level four attack felt like simply a level 1 attack, and we must make sure that these statements are true." Yaddy said with a smirk.

Hearing these words, Mitchell shook his head slightly.

******

# Chapter 1631: No Lies
At first, the General said his thanks to both Jake and Vicky. Then he explained that they couldn't be here today due to urgent business they had to attend. Quinn felt like it had to be really urgent because, for some reason, it seemed like Jake had taken an interest in his strength and identity.

But what was more disappointing for Quinn was that he lost his opportunity to talk to Vicky. After that, some vampires were called from the other sections; all of them were at the vampire noble rank. Since time had passed, it seemed the average strength cap of vampires had increased, at least for those in the Vampire Corps unit.

Since there was no suppression of vampires with the thirteen families, it was a rank that most vampires were able to obtain through hard work. However, what surprised Quinn was the General himself because the latter was at the vampire lord rank.

Since he was in the Vampire Corps, he wasn't a vampire leader, but being at the evolution of a vampire lord was no joke, meaning it would at least put him on the level of the other leaders that Quinn used to know.

'I wonder if there is an influx in vampire lords as well? I mean, it's been a thousand years, maybe there is someone else like me, someone who was able to evolve faster than others expected, becoming something beyond that of a vampire lord?' Quinn thought.

Finally, it was time for them to go through Mitchell's squad.

"I know that many of you were new recruits, and if you were to leave after what happened today, I would completely understand, but I do wish to make one thing clear. Never in the history of this base has there been a level four horde attack.

"It was out of the norm. I hope my words will bring you comfort, knowing that you survived one of the most brutal battles that you may ever fight in your life, but I will not lie. Maybe tomorrow there will be another, even greater attack, but we will train you to the best and look after everyone who is one of our own.

"Now, to thank those that have done great deeds from Lieutenant Mitchell's squad, could the following personnel please come to the stage…"

The names which they called out were Lucia, Hannah and the rest of the Red vampires. Jessica wasn't called, and she seemed to be pleased about that. Even now, Quinn noticed that she was hiding behind others as if she didn't want anyone to recognise her.

'Hmm, maybe a bad history with the Vampire Corps? Is that why she left earlier and wanted to be a traveller?'

Those called up were awarded what looked like a grey emblem to put on their clothes. It was in the shape of a blood drop. That was when Quinn noticed all the other emblems on them.

The Lieutenants and leaders of each group looked to have a bronze coloured one, while the two next to the General were silver in colour, and the General himself had a gold emblem pinned on his chest. It looked like the red vampires had somewhat achieved their goal: jumping up a rank and becoming essential members of the Vampire Corps.

"The colours don't represent a position rather, a ranking," Jessica whispered over to Quinn, having correctly assumed that the latter might be wondering about them, "There are only so many positions after all, so you might see some squads with members at the same ranks as the Lieutenants.

"They follow a structure like the military but really there at the same rank. They can transfer to another base or another planet if there is an open position. However, they still have to follow those in charge even if they are of the same rank.

"On the flip side, you might have some people who are a higher rank due to their achievements but chose not to go for higher positions due to the responsibilities that come along with such positions. Some high ranking members are just fighting maniacs; they wish to stay on the battlefield, not bothered with a higher position."

That certainly cleared up a few things for Quinn while he was looking around.

'I guess I won't get anything because I decided to head off, hmm, it looks like I will have to talk to the General personally, or hopefully, there is one more award they are giving out, one that might just put us in a good position.'

Quinn thought right, as after the others came down from the stage, they called Peter's name next. As he walked up the stage, many of the vampires whispered about what they had seen during the battle, which confirmed that Lucia wasn't exaggerating anything when she talked about what had happened after Quinn left.

"This brave White charged in the battle and faced the wrath of a single wave by himself. The White is a little unique compared to others, but regardless of that, the casualties were minimal since he alone took out most of the wave due to his great show of strength.

"He is a great example of exactly what the Vampire Corps unit is looking for." Peter was then awarded a Bronze blood emblem, which immediately put him at the same rank as Mitchell.

'Even if I don't go up the ranks to head to the earth, maybe Peter has done, and the two of us could always switch disguises, although it would be troublesome to do something about that smell.'

It was then that they called an unanticipated name while Peter was stepping down from the stage.

"Nate Snell! Please come up to receive your award." Yaddy declared. "Of course, we saved the most honoured and deserving of awards till the end."

Hearing this, Quinn walked forward and glanced towards Mitchell to see if his face could tell what was happening. Once again, the former looked as if he had done something wrong.

'Oh well, what's the worst that could happen?' Quinn didn't give it much thought as he walked onto the stage.

"As you all know, usually during a Horde, even at Level 1, the last wave is not the largest wave, but it's the one which gives the most trouble due to the level of beasts. Yet this time, there was no such final wave. Because of this, we have suffered the least possible casualties, and if you haven't guessed by now, it was all due to the person in front of you." Yaddy placed his hand out towards Quinn.

Of course, the vampires were confused by this. They hadn't seen him fight, and they hadn't seen a final wave, so they were confused about what the general was talking about. Even the vampires that were part of the new recruits had only seen him go up against Jake and then fly off somewhere.

"But, well...it seems we only have one vampire who vouches for him, but he didn't even witness the event himself," Yaddy said while glancing at Mitchell towards the end of his words and letting out a sigh.

"Everyone, this is an important lesson to you all. It is important in our Corps that we can trust each other. After all, you will have to trust the person next to you with your life on the battlefield. What I will not tolerate are those who decide to use methods to try to rise up in the ranks.

"Even if you are not caught now, you will be caught eventually. Now, if you understand that, please go back to your position."

Saying these words, of course, he was referring to Quinn. Seeing Mitchell's face, Quinn could somewhat imagine what had gone on, and it looked like General Yaddy didn't believe his tales. Honestly, Quinn didn't care, even if this was meant to humiliate him. These things seemed too insignificant compared to what he had been through. However, these words had not only embarrassed him but had embarrassed Mitchell as well.

As a new follower of his and achieving his end of the bargain, Quinn wasn't happy with that at all.

"But it's the truth. Before coming back, I faced five Demi-god tier beasts and defeated the wave." Quinn casually said, which caused the others to whisper among themselves again. Standing so close, Quinn could see a vein pop at the side of Yaddy's head.

"Are you really so shameless to admit in front of all these people?" Yaddy shouted, "I can't believe you refuse to admit the truth even now." It was then that Yaddy's eyes started to glow bright red, but instead of looking towards Quinn, he looked towards the crowd of vampires.

"Everyone, bow down to show respect to the Vampire Corps!" Yaddy ordered.

Against their will and with confusion, the vampires felt something taking over them as they bowed down. With Peter being a Wight, there was no effect on him.

'Mass Influence Skill? That's really impressive; even some of the vampire leaders of the past couldn't do that. And it seems like it worked on the strong vampires as well. His Influence Skill level must be incredibly high.' Quinn thought.

"Raise your heads," Yaddy ordered again, and the vampires complied.

"You think I can't get the truth out of you?" Yaddy said. "I gave you a chance to be humble, to learn from your mistakes, but now you must be humiliated on stage. I ask you one more time, leave the stage."

"Why should I leave when I have told the truth?" Quinn replied immediately.

The veins on Yaddy's forehead grew thicker, and he couldn't take it anymore. His eyes glowed red, just like before.

"Kneel in front of me, know and beg for forgiveness!" Yaddy shouted so loud that it echoed throughout the hall.

Everyone was frightened about what was about to happen to the new vampire, and even Mitchell was afraid until he saw what had happened, and a smile grew on his face because his master, the vampire who stood in front of Yaddy, was still standing.

"You think your measly skill will work on me?" Quinn frowned as his eyes began to glow red. "Kneel? Do you think you can do whatever you want? I hate this kind of crap the most, but since you're so eager to see someone kneel, why don't you try it yourself? KNEEL!" He shouted, and instantly, Yaddy lost control of his body as his knees slammed onto the floor.

# Chapter 1632: I'm Listening
The whole room fell silent as they all witnessed something that defied all common sense. General Yaddy was a powerful vampire at the lord level, and just seconds ago everyone inside the room had experienced his great Influence skill, including other vampire nobles. His strength was a major reason why the Vampire Corps had assigned him to Mars to take care of things.

… and yet, an unknown vampire had forced General Yaddy to submit to him!

'How is this possible?!' Yaddy asked himself as he lifted his head, attempting to get a better look at the vampire. Apart from the vampire leaders, there were only a handful of other vampires who would be able to subdue him like this, and he knew every one of those.

Laying his eyes on the 'Nate' though, it wasn't someone he recognised. His outer appearance was utterly plain, his only 'distinguishing' feature was perhaps how forgettable his face was. Yaddy mustered up all his anger and even used his own Influence in hopes of reversing this situation. He still believed that the other vampire might have just caught him unprepared. Alas, all of it was useless, his body only slightly twitched through his exertion.

"Is this some type of act? Could this be another General who has come here to replace General Yaddy?" A vampire suddenly asked out loud.

"No, that's no act. I saw him being part of the recruitment process. That guy could be one of the leaders of the Red Vampires who have come here to attack the Vampire Corps!"

Since nobody recognised Quinn this seemed like the most reasonable explantation. Hearing this possibility snapped Yaddy's right-hand men back to reality, and the vampires with the silver emblems attacked Quinn from two sides.

"Stay still!" The Celestial Vampire commanded, briefly staring at each one of them, making them stop mid-attack, unable to move. Just like Yaddy, Quinn too could use his Influence skill on more than one. With the strongest three vampires being taken out this easily, nobody else dared to intervene.

'Using an influence skill on a Vampire Lord? I know he told us that he's an Original, but are they only supposed to be slightly stronger than the vampire leaders? Could it be that we have vastly underestimated the strength of the vampires from the Great Hero's time?' Jessica wondered as she looked on in amazement.

"What…do you want?" Yaddy finally asked, struggling.

Some vampires, were wondering if they should leave the place, just in case this was an attack, but none of them had any hopes of making it out. It was apparent that their lives were now in the hand of this unknown vampire. If Yaddy could force them to stay, surely it would pose no challenge to Quinn?

'You… aren't here to harm anyone, are you?' Mitchell wondered, starting to slightly doubt his devotion.

"I've come here due to personal reasons, which I had wished to discuss with you privately. Before I got the chance, the Level Four Horde attacked, so I helped out to minimise casualties. You were the one who called us all in here, called me a liar and wanted to force me to apologise for speaking the truth.

"You could have easily solved this matter by talking to me in person, by confirming my powers for yourself. Instead, you tried to do it publicly while using the opportunity to show off your own powers. I've seen many like you in the past who enjoyed abusing their power, but if you try to do it in my presence, I will not just stand and allow that to happen!

"Fortunately for you, I'm not here to hurt you. I still have a request for you, so I shall pretend that none of this ever happened."

With that, Quinn let go of his influence and Yaddy and his men could finally move again. Everyone else was nervously watching him rise to his feet. After all, he was a Vampire Lord, yet he had just been publicly humiliated. Even if that powerful vampire was willing to forgive him, would the General's pride allow it?

"I… I was wrong." Yaddy admitted to the shock of everyone. "I only wished to confirm that you really were the one that had put an end to that wave, and now I am convinced that it was no lie. With the beast crystals and this, I can tell you are a vampire capable of doing such a thing. Once again, I greatly apologise for my way of handling things."

Yaddy even willingly bowed down out of his own accord, which came as a surprise not just for Mitchell, but the rest of the vampires as well. After lifting his head, the Vampire Lord handedly, over another Bronze blood emblem that was in his hand. Quinn looked at it for a few seconds before eventually putting it into his pocket.

"I hope things like this don't happen in the future, so that we can continue working together." Quinn said as he walked back through the crowd to his original position. The other vampires were cautiously moving out of the way, making sure to stay away from him. One thing was running through all of their minds, this person was incredibly dangerous. First being able to go up against Jake Green and now this.

Looking at the back of Quinn's, Yaddy one particular thought running through his head-

'This vampire, is incredibly dangerous and something needs to be done!'

'Now that I have this Bronze ranking, it should hopefully allow me to get answers to my questions. Perhaps I can even ask to be moved to the Earth Vampire Corps unit.' Quinn thought. 'It's a shame I missed the opportunity to speak with Vicky, but if I can get through to Jake that might be another way to contact Logan. I also need to keep up my facade with the Red Vampires as well.

'This is all a little tiring.' Quinn thought, as he folded his arms, thinking he had done quite a good job.

After what had just happened, nobody was surprised when General Yaddy called off the rest of the meeting. He had already informed them about pretty much everything they needed to know and honestly, he needed some time to gather his thoughts. The other vampires were in a similar mental situation.

The squads were to continue with their duties, leaving Mitchell in charge of the new recruits including Quinn and the others. He took them to where they would be sleeping, showing them their tasks and more.

'I…was scared… when was the last time that I, a Vampire Lord who has lived for hundreds of years, was afraid of a vampire who wasn't one of the leaders? What's more, I have never seen before… I need to find out everything I can about this person.' Yaddy thought as he was left alone in the meeting room.

At the same time, a certain group of vampires that had been put in a shared room, in the town next to the barracks, were discussing the same thing. These were the Red Vampires. Even for them, they couldn't stop talking about what the feat Quinn had accomplished.

"Hannah, I apologise for all my thoughts about him! I can't believe that you were able to convince such a strong vampire to join us. Our leaders are going to be over the moon!" One of the vampires claimed.

"Yeah…" Hannah replied, pretending to have known about Quinn's strength all along. Of course, she had no idea that this vampire she had picked up would be this impressive, and there was something else on her mind.

After everyone went back to their rooms, Derik, had also left the rest of the vampires and was sitting on top of their house's roof.

'We shouldn't trust such a strong outsider. We've seen how incredibly dangerous he can be. Do they really believe in our case? Isn't it far more likely that they have another agenda by joining us?!'

Placing his finger to the side of his head, Derik was focusing, he was waiting for the signal and finally got through,

"What is so urgent that you have decided to contact me directly? You should know how incredible busy I am." An annoyed female voice sounded from the other side.

"I'm sorry, but I have a concern about a specific vampire who is trying to join the Red Vampires. I believe our current leader is being misguided. I felt the need to report this to you right away. Allow me to recount everything I've seen this vampire do. If you decide that this was not worth your attention, I will be ready to accept any punishment!" Derik explained himself.

The sounds of someone tapping a black sword could be heard, before the voice eventually said.

"…I'm listening."

# Chapter 1633: The New Powers Gather
The Dhampirs on Mars were currently residing in the area governed by Pure, enjoying their protection. They weren't an officially recognised group that the people supported per se, most likely because their only goal appeared to be to get rid of all the vampires, without any care for politics, much less the well-being of the normal people.

Compared to the areas owned by the Green family and the Vampire Corps, Pure's areas seemed to be far calmer. There were less city-like structures and more residential areas to them. There were houses, and much greenery in between, with many humans enjoying a nice lifestyle. Of course, many of them were Pure members who worked important jobs that benefited the group as a whole. However, the labs and facilities were far away from the living areas.

Every so often, Pure would broadcast their way of life to the other world, showing off their peaceful life that was guaranteed by the soldiers, with only those who wanted to fight on the front lines. However, some would also argue that the reason the Vampire Corps and the Green families couldn't live this way was due to the Dhampirs that they were protecting, and Pure in the first place.

They were the ones benefiting from those two factions ensuring the peace on the planets, yet instead of thanking them, they would instead try to eradicate the vampires, and those that supported them. Meanwhile, the Vampire Corps stayed back on the defensive. It was a real struggle, since everyone knew the story of the great Hero Quinn.

The story of a vampire saving the world from the Dalki. Unfortunately, without a real threat uniting them, humanity proved how selfish they could be, with those in charge caring about their own lives more than anything. So if they could live peacefully with the vampires gone, then they would be sure to support it and happy to live with Pure.

For them, it was just a question of picking the right side of a fight that was bound to happen. Still, it was a current war situation, so to speak. To the public, it was just a battle between those in the said groups with extreme views. Society continued from two areas with no trouble, and the groups did their best to keep it this way, which was why at the moment, a regular meeting that would occur was taking place.

Only this time, the meeting was called earlier than usual and rather than Logan attending himself, he had sent two aides that happened to be nearby, his wife Vicky, as well as his son Jake. Usually at this type of meeting, everyone who was of importance would come to attend this meeting, however, neither member of the Green family was interested in meeting any bootlickers. They were also powerful enough to not require any bodyguards, so they requested for the meeting to only be attended by the ones in charge.

The spaceship had approached the largest building that was placed far away from the border. It was a giant triangle shaped building that looked somewhat like a pyramid, only the base of it was thinner, giving a higher point like that of the tower. The ship landed midway of the building where there was a platform, and a few checks were done, before the two were allowed in.

"This place looks to be as peaceful as always." Jake commented as he walked calmly past all the humans, and eventually entered an elevator taking him to the meeting point. The two had entered a dark room, where at the other end, one could see two other present.

Of course, there were several guards lined at the edge of the room, and what might have looked strange in the centre acting as some type of wall between the two. Jake and Vicky stood on two circles on their side of the room, which then 3D projected their body as a larger version of themselves in the centre. On the other side of the room, two of them did the same. One wearing a large robe, and had a pair of thick black glasses on his face.

"Agent Four, it is always a pleasure to see your happy face, but I have to ask, why didn't you tell us that there would be an extra guest at this meeting?" Jake questioned.

As for the other 3D projection, it was a stunning female that looked to be a young adult, only just perhaps out of her teenage years. However, she wore a shining bright armour that was clearly at a high level of beast gear, and had stunning flowing blonde hair that had a single braided part down the middle of it.

"Perhaps Pure is finally admitting to siding with the Dhampirs?" Vicky also added, clearly agonising the woman for what she was.

"As our group grows larger, as well as to lessen the burden of having to fight on the public as much as possible, Agent Four believed it was best that I attend this meeting as well." The young woman stated her reason for being here. "Besides, one day there will be more that supports us. More and more humans are seeing vampires for what they truly are."

"You mean humanity's saviour?!" Vicky banged the table in front of her as she bent forward.

"And as thankful as we are for their participation during the Dalki war more than a thousand years ago, we can't overlook what happened after that point in time. One good deed does not overshadow centuries of abuse. Need I remind you that it is also a vampire that wishes to destroy the human race for what it is currently?" The young woman replied nonchalantly.

There was clear annoyance on both Jake and Vicky's face, but they bit their tongue, as they knew it was useless to argue against a Dhampir. Not a single member of their race had ever changed their mind about the existence of vampires.

"Which is why we decided to work with Pure, to get rid of those SPECIFIC vampires!" Vicky spoke, looking over at Agent Four. "Using their resources in tandem with our Green family's, we have been able to suppress the actions and doing of the Red Vampires every day. I believe my husband has been working closely with you sharing information about the Red Heart in order to prevent that from happening!

"Meanwhile, what has your side been doing? You maniacs went as far as hunting vampires on the Graylash planet!" Vicky shook her head, as if she was a disappointed mother. "You should put a chain on your dogs unless you would like them involved in all of this mess… or is that it? Do you want things to return to how they've been in the past?!"

Although the young Dhampir didn't show annoyance on her face, in fact her face was pretty expressionless the whole time even when speaking, her actions showed something else, as her hand went towards the hilt of her sword.

"You really don't want to be threatening my mother." Jake stated, taking a step in front of Vicky, as red lightning was surrounding his outstretched hand, with his eyes glowing green. This time he wasn't playing around, but was deeply annoyed.

"Let's just move on and get on with this meeting, so we can all go back home." Agent Four interrupted both sides before it would devolve into a fight. Under the Pure agent's gaze the Dhampir's shed her sword. "I was the one that called this meeting and called you two here, however, not everyone is here yet."

Just as he said those words, the sound of the door was heard opening once again. Several vampires in black and red were left standing outside, as another started to enter the room, and eventually stood on the ring.

Jake, Vicky, and even the Dhampir seemed surprised to see who was here, because it was the first for these two forces to meet.

It was the Vampire Corps leader.

# Chapter 1634 - The Vampire Corps Leader

The Vampire Corps. A unit of vampire soldiers that once acted as a force for Earth, but as time went on, they eventually became a faction which still worked closely with the Leader of the humans and the Green family. A part of the military that was composed mostly of vampires.

Other than this, Quinn didn't know much about them. However, he had received hints about where they might have originated from one of them was the vampire soldiers. Paul's men, who Ashley had led, worked closely with the old Earthborn group. This was one of his theories, but there was another thought.

Many of those in the Vampire Corps unit would learn the String Ability. The string ability has always been a strong and versatile skill. Even if one was against an opponent who outmatched them, they could still use this strong ability to support themselves in different ways to create an advantage.

Perhaps this was why the Vampire Corps chose to learn such an ability, but for Quinn, he had another guess: Somehow, the thirteenth family were deeply involved in the Vampire Corps.

******

When the Vampire Corps leader had entered the meeting room, the others were surprised because of where they were currently at. To see such a person in a place like this. Because at the moment, they were on Mars, and the main base of the Vampire Corps was on Earth.

Yet, rather than sending someone else, like an envoy, the Leader had himself come. His footsteps were quite heavy as he walked through the hall, with his boots firmly planted on the ground with each step. His breath was light, which looked strange for one somene of his size; his body was large, and his shoulders were broad.

Then, there were his muscular arms; they weren't too big but were chiselled and defined, with nothing covering them, since the suit of beast armour he was wearing seemed only to protect his chest, leaving his arms free.

The chest piece he was wearing went down to his waist and was quite tight-fitting to the body, not being too bulky, while right at the centre dividing the two chest pieces it looked like a large needle would go down to one of the belly buttons on the suit.

And another thing to note was the texture of the beast plate armour—it seemed as if someone had made it out of bones.

Still, just like with many in the Vampire Corps, most of what the Leader was wearing were black and red. As for his facial features, they looked different compared to most vampires. He had long white hair and swept back; in fact, it was so long that after it went past the back of his neck, it was tied up in a long ponytail.

Most of the vampires had dark coloured hair; even when a human is turned, their hair colour would sometimes change, but for this one, his hair was white and longer than the usual.

Then there was his defined face that one could see. He smiled at the rest of them with his eyes curved and jawline when he finally reached the centre.

"It's nice to meet like this and have no trouble between us all, right" The Vampire Corps leader said.

When his face and body were projected in the centre of the room, others saw a name appear beneath his hologram: Andy Sanguinis.

With his arms crossed, there was a large smile on his face but in the next instant the young female dhampir had jumped right through the hologram version of the corps leader and for a second, the large image distorted.

Now holding her sword which she unleashed from the sheath she launched out a large wave of yellow aura straight towards the vampire. The men who stood around the centre were perplexed but could only glance at each other. They hadn't even seen her move from her position. Regardless, it didn't seem like her attack was something that they would be able to stop anyway.

Her strike was incredibly fast. As soon as the sword left the sheath, the energy moved, coming out at an incredible speed. And before the energy reached the target, she had put the sword back in the sheath.

Witnessing this. Andy didn't look afraid, he didn't even flinch, or unfold his arms, clearly showing his indifference as the attack came towards him, but that was because someone was already there to stop the attack. It was Jake Green. He immediately fired off his red lighting strike that hit the yellow aura of energy and wholly dissipated the incoming attack.

"You really want to fight here? Don't you know who else is currently in this room?" Jake shouted at the reckless dhampir.

Spinning around in midair, the young woman had stepped back and was back in her position.

"If you really want a fight, you should have brought your leader to stop me," Jake stated as the powerful red lighting began to envelop both of his arms. All those in the room were nervous and waiting for Agent Four to step in or do something.

Instead, he just shook his head as if all of this was an enormous pain in the neck. Jumping up himself, Jake threw both of his hands together, aiming straight towards the dhampir, ready to punish her for her actions.

No one would complain about his reaction today due to what had happened earlier in the beast wave attack, and Vicky knew this, which was why she hadn't stopped her son like she usually would have. On the other side though, Agent four lifted his hand, and a red ring could be seen on his finger.

It soon started to glow with power, and at that moment, as the lighting was about to hit the dhampir, an invisible wall suddenly formed in between. It wasn't too hidden as the lighting caused red ripples to appear in the air, completely stopping the attack and turning it into almost nothing.

Landing back on the floor and standing beside the others, Jake couldn't help but click his tongue when he saw this.

"That damn blood armour!"

"I do not wish to ruin any of the relationships that we have built, so you better not act so rashly, or I will send you back." Agent four said to the dhampir next to him and then turned to the others. "Everyone should be able to control themselves now, so we all don't have to stay in the same room for long. I will quickly talk about the current agenda. "The Red vampire's powers seem to be growing day by day, and today this very base was attacked by a Guardian.

The others, hearing this, looked towards each other. It was hard to tell what they were thinking just from their expressions.

"This Guardian attacked the dhampirs and even took two of ours as hostages with him. Now, this Guardian is far stronger than any of us predicted. If there is one thing all the parties currently this room have in commo it's the fact that we are all against the red vampires, which is why I have informed you all about this. Also, there is a specific reason I have invited her here."

Agent four then glanced at the dhampir, indicating it was her time to speak, but she looked to still have her hand on her sword hilt; she was trying to control herself and her emotions while looking towards the Vampire Corps leader, who eventually tucked out his tongue towards her seeing this and chuckled out of amusement.

"I...I am here to request something. Everyone in this room has been trying to find the red heart before the Red Vampires. So far, no one has succeeded, which means either it's already in the hands of one of the groups or it's simply hidden out there somewhere.

However, we dhampirs have come up with another solution. We have located one of the Red Vampire leaders. As you know, the Red Vampires consist of two main leaders. We are requesting permission to enter each group's areas and get rid of the red vampires once and for all. We want to launch a full scale attack against them." The dhampir spoke.

# Chapter 1635 - Worship

After the events that transpired today in the hall, there was a lot of commotion in the Vampire Corps base. It was lively, and rather than talking about the Horde attack, almost everyone was discussing the mysterious vampire who had shocked everyone during the meeting.

Rumours had already spread like wildfire that perhaps the mysterious person was an original vampire, someone from one of the thirteen families, or at the very least one of the leaders who were still alive. Either way, Quinn had achieved his goal.

Whether or not Yaddy liked him wasn't a problem; the fact that he wasn't attacking and still allowed to stay in the Vampire Corps to exist showed that he wasn't an enemy. All Quinn cared about was getting to Earth and finding out the truth.

He needed a ship that would take him there, and then he would have to find a way to talk to Logan Green without being attacked on the spot, or threatening people or revealing his real identity, because that would just cause more nuisance and delays. It had only been a few days since they had woken up, and Quinn felt like he had progressed relatively quickly in his goal to discover the truth about the past and to find his old friends.

"I want to thank you two for protecting Missy and guiding us so far," Quinn said to the people with him.

He and Peter were currently sharing an apartment block, along with Minny, Lucia, Jessica. At the same time, the red vampires were staying in a different room entirely. At first, Quinn thought that this was disadvantageous, as he still wanted to learn as much about the red vampires as possible, but in the end, they weren't his allies, while those that were with him were.

"Nate... " Jessica called out, to which Quinn hadn't turned his head and somewhat ignored. Only later responding by moving his head.

It looked like Jessica wanted to say or ask something.

"Don't worry; its not really my business," Jessica said, looking at him and smiling. "But can I ask you one thing? You're...not against the Vampire Corps, are you? Teaming up with the red vampires, I know you said you have been sleeping for a long time, and now that I've seen what you can do and..."

"I .." Quinn wondered about what to say in response. The Vampire Corps, the red vampires, Pure, Dahmpirs, the Green family. "I will be honest, I don't know yet—That's what I'm trying to find out. For now, I honestly don't want to hurt anyone and just want to know what's happening. I'm sorry that I can't give you a better answer."

Thinking about this, he thought about two hostages that he needed to interrogate, from whom he would for sure get some answers.

"There is something that I need to attend to. I will be taking Peter with me. I hope that you can look after Minny in the meantime. I doubt anything will happen since we are in the Vampire Corps unit. However, if anything were to go wrong, tell Minny to call me, and I will be here straight away. It shouldn't belong." Quinn instructed, to which Jessica nodded.

Minny was peacefully sleeping in the room, and Quinn didn't really want to disturb her. Soon, he and Peter left the apartment block. After closing the door, Quinn quickly used his shadow travel to hide his presence and move without anyone noticing him.

The sun had long set, and it was now dark outside, the perfect conditions for using shadow travel, making it almost impossible for others to spot a moving shadow on the ground. And if there was a shadow already, it would be even less likely.

Although others could still sense them if they tried, no one was looking out or trying to find Quinn, so they were safe. Eventually, the two reached a less populated area that was covered with hills, greenery and a lovely little lake.

"I will be in the shadow space for a while. I don't know how long it will take, but I wanted to bring you here just in case, and I wanted to see what you exactly look like with that celestial energy and see how this energy affects you." Quinn explained.

Just as he finished his words, an unexpected message appeared in front of him.

[Three more followers have met the condition]

[3 more celestial points have been granted]

[20/23 Cleistal energy]

'What the...why would I get celestial points now?' Quinn wondered, trying to rack his head, as the only person he had told about the condition was Mitchell. 'It couldn't be?'.

———

After the meeting was over, Mitchell was beyond impressed. The person he had chosen to follow was far more impressive than he thought, and he felt like his intuition was right; this vampire was built different.

Usually, those with such power, if treated with disrespect like that, especially being in a higher position, would have killed the nuisance. However, Quinn did no such thing to the other party. And after that display of power from the latter, Mitchell was beginning to believe that the person could really be the great hero Quinn.

Because of this, as soon as he finished his duties and helped the new recruits settle down, Mitchell went to the statue of the great hero once more. He decided to complete the condition once more. Although Quinn had said there was only a need to do it once a month, Mitchell wanted to make this a daily routine, simply out of respect.

He knelt down in front of the statue and made a small cut on his hand. At that moment, three other long term members of the Vampire Corps had witnessed what Mitchell was doing. "I have never seen one do that in front of the statue before. Did today's incident make you go mad?" One of the vampires asked as he walked closer.

"Mad?... No, it's more like I have never seen things clearly in my life before." Mitchell replied. "I am simply paying respects to our hero.' Seeing how the two other vampires seemed somewhat interested in what he was doing, Mitchell had an idea

"It's a long-forgotten ritual. It is said that during the fight with the Great DaIld, Quinn had requested all of the vampires, and the humans, to help him battle by drawing out their blood. The blood of the vampires and humans at the time gave our hero great power.

"If it wasn't for him, we wouldn't be here today, yet he is not with us. This is why, wherever he is, I wish to give him a part of my blood by doing this. This is a ritual I have restarted to give me peace of mind about what we are doing. Now, this is something I do every day!" Mitchell added, placing his hand on his chest.

Of course, many vampires in the Vampire Corps also respected the great hero Quinn, which was why there were many statues of him around the base. After hearing Mitchell's passionate words, the others were quite swayed. What were a few drops of blood to show respect to the one who saved the whole world?

The three of them decided to do the same out of respect, granting Quinn a few more celestial points.

———

Unaware of this, Quinn decided to enter the shadow because he had more important matters he needed to attend to. For him, all that notification meant was that he had more celestial points to pass onto Peter and see how much it would improve his strength.

Using the shadow lock skill on himself, Quinn soon found himself in the shadow space. Straight away, he went to the great source of power in his shadow space, the Dragon.

This was the demon tier beast used to create the Dalki, but currently, Ray, an ancestor of Quinn, was residing in it. Upon reaching the great Dragon, Quinn saw it again after a long time.

It looked just as strong as before, only it now had two heads on its body, as the two parts of the Dragon had reformed together.

"So you finally made it in here; I have been keeping these two for a while now,' Ray said, speaking to Quinn directly in his mind.

Underneath its giant feet were the two dhampirs whom Quinn had captured.

"Did they try to use the Q. explosion on themselves? Quinn asked.

The Dragon snouted all four of its nostrils as if it was proud.

"Of course they did, but in front of the Great Red Dragon..uh, well in front of me, they were nothing! Do you remember I once told you that I had a skill that I could use that could drain them of all Qi in their body? Instead of draining them, it actually steals the Qi from their body. So currently, these two don't have an ounce of Qi in their body, including that nasty little Qi command skill."

"You mean... " That's when Quinn realised. If they didn't have Qi in their body or the Qi command, the two dhampirs could not kill themselves. However, the more important thing was this condition allowed Quinn a chance to use his Influence Skill.

"Well, let's hope what I'm thinking isn't true."

*****

# Chapter 1636: The Queen

Since Quinn had evolved, it was safe to say that with his Charm points, there wasn't a vampire or human that he couldn't put under his influence skill. The fact that he could easily control Yaddy, who was at the vampire lord level, proved this assumption.

However, while he was in slumber, the humans had all learned how to utilise Qi. It seemed like the second stage, to form Qi into shapes, externally and internally, was prioritised because of vampires.

It was made to counterattack the Influence Skill, which was why Quinn couldn't just use this on humans for information as much as he would have liked to. On top of that, he was trying to find information of what exactly had happened in the 1000 years, which wasn't something any random person on the road would know.

It was made to counterattack the Influence Skill, which was why Quinn couldn't just use this on humans for information as much as he would have liked to. On top of that, he was trying to find information of what exactly had happened in the woo years, which wasn't something any random person on the road would know.

Even though someone like Jessica was willing to speak to him, she didn't have the information he needed, but there was one group that Quinn felt like had caused a significant change compared to the past, and that was the Dhampirs.

During his time, there had only been a single one in existence created, which was due to himself. So in a way, Quinn felt like it was his duty to find out what had happened with the dhampirs. The only problem was that not only did they have this second stage of Qi protecting their minds, but they also had some type of Qi command to commit suicide in case of trouble.

This command would initiate when a person placed their own Qi into their bodies, and it would cause a Qi explosion which would instantly kill them. It was a problem that Quinn was trying to get around, and it looked like rather than having to solve the problem himself, Ray had solved it for him by using Qi drain and getting rid of all of the Qi from their bodies.

'I hate to admit it, but I guess Ray can do things that even I can't, even though I'm the one that is meant to be some type of god. I guess Ray really was a strong almighty being in his time.' Quinn thought.

'I already told you, I was an anomaly, an existence that could even bring down gods with my power. How many times do I have to tell you before you will ever believe me?' Ray commented, huffing through his nostrils once again.

Hearing this made Quinn realise that Ray was in some way able to read his thoughts, so he should be a little careful. Walking over to the two of them, Quinn's eyes started to glow red as he stood in front of him.

The dragon's foot was large but seemed to be pressed on top of them just enough so they couldn't move. Both of them looked at Quinn and even attempted to spit at him, but a shadow rose from the ground stopping the spit in its tracks.

"You Red Vampires are scum!" One of the dhampirs shouted, seeing the shadow. "You were the cause of everything, and we will get rid of you all!"

"I want you to answer all my questions truthfully and to the best of your knowledge. I will let you guys go after that." Quinn said while also using the influence skill.

Their hands and head began to shake, though their eyes still looked slightly alive. It was the first time Quinn had seen something like this when using his influence skill since becoming a celestial.

'Is this some kind of natural resistance the dhampirs have against vampire skills? That would give somewhat sense to being called vampire hunters and all. A natural enemy created by nature or something like that.' Quinn thought.

However, eventually, Quinn's influence skill won, and the liveness in their eye. had faded. This incident told Quinn that maybe in future, if he faced the stronger dhampirs, he might have trouble using his influence skill, so he should ask as many questions as possible.

"What are the guardians?" Quinn asked.

"The Guardians are a group of vampires belonging to the Red Vampires. They are the strongest vampires in the Red Vampire group working for their leaders and know how to use the shadow ability." The dhampirs both answered simultaneously.

All the Guardians know how to use the Shadow ability? I guess that's why the enemy earlier assumed I was a guardian when they saw my shadow wings, but does that mean the Red Vampires are really being run by Laxmus? Did he teach others how to use the shadow ability, or is it the remnants of the Cursed faction?'

The reason why Quinn was more inclined to believe that it was Laxmus was because of his skill shadow link. For some reason, he couldn't feel others with the shadow. But, he could feel Minny's presence, whom he had recently taught the shadow skill.

However, since the day when Laxmus escaped, Quinn had never been able to feel the former's shadow powers or at least the powers he had stolen, so perhaps the shadow was different, or Laxmus had some way to block the link.

"How many guardians are there? What do they look like?" Quinn asked.

This time, however, the two of them didn't answer. It looked like these dhampirs had never come across any guardian before.

Quinn went on to ask for more information regarding the Red Vampires, their leader, what they had done and such, but they weren't able to tell any worth mentioning information to him. However, they did tell about all the incidents caused by the vampires.

After that, Quinn went to ask about their relation with Pure, if they knew the leaders and such, but the dhampirs claimed that they only worked for their own kind, and the leader's alliance with Pure was simply due to their leader, and if their leader thought it was a good idea, then they would follow it.

Now it was time for Quinn to ask questions about the dhampirs themselves. Taking a deep breath, this was the part that Quinn was somewhat dreading learning about.

"How are dhampirs created?" Quinn asked.

"There are three known reasons behind the creation of the vampires. The first one is from the birth of a human and vampire relationship, although conceiving a baby is very rare. The second is that the Dhampirs are a creation of a vampire, and lastly, the Dhampir can be created by another dhampir, just like the vampires."

This was what Quinn was afraid of. He thought it would be something like this with the increase of dhampirs. Essentially, they were like vampires, almost a variant of them, but against vampires, they were far stronger than what he had seen.

"What is the dhampir's goal? Why are you killing vampires?"

"For the extermination of every vampire in this world. It is our purpose. We can feel it inside us, and eventually, we will be free from this feeling."

Once again, Quinn wished that he had Vincent by his side. He found it hard to believe that getting rid of all the vampires would allow their urge to disappear. From what Quinn knew, the dhampir's urge to hunt vampires was similar to a vampire's urge for blood.

If all vampires disappeared, he couldn't believe that the dhampirs would just no longer have this urge. Perhaps someone was feeding them these lies, and the most likely suspect was the one on the top.

"The dhampir leader, is it the one you refer to as Queen?" Quinn asked.

"Yes." Both of them answered immediately.

Then taking a deep breath, Quinn asked the last question, which has been bugging him ever since his first encounter with the dhampirs after waking up from his slumber.

"The one that you refer to as Queen of the dhampirs is her name Erin Heley?"

There was a pause, and for a second, Quinn thought he was going to get no answer until...

"Yes."

Now having learnt this fact Quinn had stopped for a second, it was clear it was all proving difficult for him, but he had to continue.

"Is she still alive?"

"Yes."

Standing up, Quinn turned away from the two of them; he didn't want to show the disappointment on his face to anyone.

'Originally, the Dalki were created by the vampires, and the human's lives were in danger...now the vampires are in trouble, and the one that created this mess is me. I have to stop her...even if that means I need to kill her.' Quinn clenched his teeth.

*****

# Chapter 1637: Dirty little secret

Jessica and Lucy, who were in the apartment, decided to play with Minny while waiting for Quinn and Peter. Being a young girl, it was easy for Minny to get bored, and whatever they tried didn't seem to work on her.

They watched shows on the TV played on a few game consoles left in the room, among other things. In the end, Minny said that she wished to play catch. But the two girls knew it wouldn't be safe to go outside right now, so they decided to play in the room.

Just then, Jessica had a serious look on her face as she charged in as fast as she could, her arms spread wide in an attempt to grab Minny. However, the latter quickly jumped up and even pushed off her head.

"Minny, it's rude to do that to your sisters!" Lucia said as she had ignited even her hands with a bit of lighting in an attempt to grab hold of Minny. However, the latter was able to avoid that as well, as she threw out parts of her blood aura from her hands and towards the door to push herself slightly backwards, making her fingers miss just a little.

As soon as the blood aura hit the walls, they heard a large bang. The walls were pretty solid, so they didn't break, but some deep cracks did appear.

"Maybe we should stop there," Jessica said. "It looks like you've won this game, Minny. How about we do something else?"

Jessica and Lucia had been trying to catch Minny for a while. At first, they thought that perhaps they would have to go easy on her during the match and eventually let her win. However, after realising that wasn't the case, the two of them used their full speed, and Lucia had even resorted to using her abilities, yet they still were unsuccessful.

The two women were afraid that if this little game were to go on, they would damage the room a little too much, which would bring even more attention.

Minny was sitting down on the sofa, between Lucy and Jessica, as the latter gave her a small blood juice box.

"No, Daddy said that I have to try and restrain myself from drinking blood, and also that I should only drink blood once a week or when I get hurt!" Minny claimed.

Hearing this, Jessica knew what 'Nate' was trying to do. It was to wane her off the blood lust. It was training that vampires in the vampire crops did and was something that vampires of the old times did as well. For Quinn to start such training for someone so young, she found it strange.

"Well, Daddy isn't here right now, and I'm sure he just hasn't been able to keep up with the times. Artificial blood is in large supply, so you don't have to worry about those things. I promise we won't tell him."

Minny had thought about it for a while, and in the end, she allowed her instincts to kick in as she grabbed the blood juice box and started drinking it away. Her cheeks began to puff up wide as she drank the drink relatively fast, and the women couldn't help but agree that Minny was the cutest little thing in the world.

"Speaking of your dad, he's such a powerful person. No wonder Minny is a strong vampire just like him." Jessica commented.

After giving the juice box a few slurps, Minny patted her small tummy and let out a little burp.

"That's impossible. He's not my real Daddy; I just call him Daddy."

"Not your real daddy?" Lucia repeated and looked at Jessica for confirmation, but the latter was just as lost as her. "Then who is your daddy, and why are you with Nate?"

It seemed like Minny had a few seconds to think about that before she finally came up with an answer.

"I don't know who my real Daddy is. It was always just my mum and me, but after I separated from her, Daddy One came along and looked after me. Minny thinks everyone is slow and weak because Daddy One was so strong."

The girls felt like facepalming as this was a difficult situation to decipher, to say the least, and they were wondering if they should even try and get more involved in this or back out now, but they were just too deep.

"Daddy One.. is daddy One your real daddy? and Daddy Two Nate?" Jessica asked.

Once again, though, Minny shook her head. "Daddy One is the Daddy that looked after Minny and Mummy. He protected us from all the strange monsters. I used to watch him fight all the time, and once in a while, he would explain to Minny.

"Daddy One was faster than both of you."

"Then Minny, do you mind explaining to us why you are with Daddy Two at the moment, and where is daddy One?" Jessica asked again. She was fishing for answers, and while the other two were away, perhaps it was her chance to get them.

"Daddy Two is friends with Daddy One. Minny was in danger, and Daddy Two saved me...I trust both of my Daddies." Minny explained. "Both of them are stronger than anyone I have ever seen. Daddy One...I don't know what happened to him, but you can ask Daddy Two."

After seeing what Minny could do, the two girls thought they could somewhat understand where Minny's strength had come from. She was in an environment where she perhaps was surrounded by monstrously powerful vampires. To adapt and be around them, she had to be strong. Although it still didn't clear things up.

"Minny, do you mind telling us something," Lucia said as she scooted over to her side. "You trust us, right? If you do, do you mind telling us about your Daddy, who he is, like what type of vampire and from which family? If you don't know that, just tell us what you know about him."

Hearing these words, Minny started to frown, as if she knew what the girls were asking was something that Quinn didn't want them to know. Eventually, the girls even put their hands together to beg her.

"We promise we won't tell your dad or Uncle about this. We're your sisters. We're family, right? And family shouldn't have secrets from each other, and we're just concerned about you." Jessica stated.

Eventually, Minny had decided, as she lifted her hand and presented three stubby little fingers.

"Three more juice boxes, I want three more juice boxes, and I'll tell you everything I know, but you can't tell them that I told you."

The two women smiled as it seemed like the easiest thing in the world. They got the three more juice boxes in no time and handed them over to Minny. She quickly sipped all three away, and her little belly was getting larger and growing by the second.

They thought it was now too obvious to hide it from 'Nate', but it was worth the price.

"Daddy's real name isn't Nate." Minny finally said.

These words alone confirmed that he had been using a different identity, but even then if they knew his real name, what would they do? Jessica thought that perhaps she would have to ask her father if he knew who this person was after learning his name.

Just as Minny opened her mouth to say something though, they heard a knock at the door.

"Damn it, who has appeared at this time?" Jessica thought.

Looking through the peephole, she was surprised to see that the person on the other side was someone whom she recognised. It was one of the Red Vampires, Derik.

"What's the problem?" Jessica asked, without opening the door.

Rather than answering, the door had quickly been kicked in, breaking off its hinge and hitting Jessica by surprise. The next second, and a red aura, fist smashed through the door and hit Jessica in the stomach, sending her flying back and crashing into the wall.

*****

# Chapter 1638: Not the only one with a secret

Seeing who was on the other side of the door, Jessica cautiously asked why the Red Vampires had come. Since she felt like the other red vampires were most likely not aware that Quinn and Peter were not in the room, they wouldn't try anything funny.

If anything, she attempted to talk to them first to delay them from entering, or at least find out why they were at the door, but before she could do any of that, the last thing she was expecting was for a red aura-filled fist coming right through the door and into her stomach.

It was a powerful blow, and from a strong vampire as Derik, who was second in command within the Red Vampires group. Jessica went flying into the wall, crashing against it, she fell on the group. A wound appeared on her stomach, but it was slowly recovering due to the natural healing ability of vampires.

"What are you doing? We're on the same side." Lucia said as she immediately pulled out her spear and spread out her ability. However, the spear lit up more dimly compared to before. She had been fighting non stop out on the field, and later on, the game of tag had worn her out even more.

She wasn't in the best condition to fight, to say the least, but knew that Jessica wouldn't be able to handle things on her own, especially after noticing there were three members of the red vampires.

"It looks like the other two aren't here like we thought, so it's the perfect opportunity to act," Derik said, looking around the room a little scared.

"You scumbag," Jessica claimed as she stood up; her wound was almost healed, "You decided to attack us when you knew the other two were away? Are you that scared of them? Scared of what they would do to you?"

This comment seemed to enrage Derik as he swung out his armful of red aura, giving out a blood slash towards Jessica. Seeing this, Lucia acted as she slashed through the red aura, breaking it apart, but the blue light now had dimmed from her spear completely. If Derik used another attack like that, she wouldn't be able to stop it.

"Those two are clearly not normal. You saw them today!" Derik shouted. "We need to make sure that he is not trying to go against us Red Vampires, and to do that, we just need some insurance."

It was then that the two other vampires that had yet to act had gone straight for Minny. Lucia, the only one standing between them and Minnry, thrusted her spear again, but Derik quickly moved from the door and grabbed onto the spear tightly while kicking her away.

Now Derik held the spear in his hand.

"I don't usually use beast weapons, but this one would be a waste to throw." He coated the spear in a strong, powerful red aura in the next instant.

He could see that Jessica, having recovered, was now going towards the two other vampires as well. Rather than using a blood swipe, she had pulled out two small daggers and had coated them in the red aura, condensing it malting them stronger.

Seeing this, he knew she was quite the skilful vampire, enough to have even already wrapped her string ability around Minny and pulled her back slightly away from the others. Still, she was far too focused on one thing, protecting Minny.

The spear left Derik's hand at an incredible speed, and just as she was about to slash forward towards one of the vampires, the spear went right through her shoulder, sending her back and pinning her against the wall again.

"We are not some weak vampires!' Derik shouted, walking over towards Minny, who hadn't been hurt but had her escape path blocked by the other two. "I am not a weak vampire; I am a respected vampire among the red vampires who truly cares for the group and will go to any lengths to protect them!"

Nodding his head, Derik had given the signal for the two vampires to attempt to grab her, and they both walked forward.

"Minny, play tag!" Lucia shouted while pressing her hand on her left side. It seemed like a rib or two had broken and pierced some organs, and she was currently trying to use whatever little Qi she had to stop it from becoming a serious matter.

Hearing these words though, Minny thought back to the game they were playing. Rather than being her scared self, she looked at the arms approaching her and could see that they weren't as fast or scary as they first seemed.

Jumping up, she leapt onto the man's arm, and with one jump, she avoided both of their grabs. She eventually reached the shoulder and jumped off towards one of the sofas in the room, landing safely.

"What do I do now?" Minny asked.

By this time, Jessica had pulled the spear out from her shoulder, but the deep wound was still there. She would have to consume bland to heal such intense wounds, this meant she was down to one arm now.

"Just get out of here, Minny, get out of here! Remember what they said; they will be able to find you if you were in trouble, so call them!" Jessica shouted.

Thinking about this, Minny was wondering what Quinn meant. He had never explained how exactly she would be able to find them even though they were in trouble. They were in trouble now, so why hadn't Quinn arrived?

"I can't leave you; you are my sisters, family sticks together!" Minny started shouting, and tears started to flow down her face. "I can't lose my family...I can't be away from my family again, and I can't be the reason everyone gets hurt!"

The two girls didn't understand why Minny was so upset because they had no idea what she had been through—having been separated from her mother for so long and being captured by the enemy.

She didn't really know what was happening in the war, but even at a young age, she at least knew why they hadn't killed her, how they wanted to use her, and she understood that something similar was happening again.

Minny had prepared herself. She would use everything she could in the fight to save them. Holding up her arms, she remembered the pain from using the rifle gun form before, but having seen it work once, she was prepared to use it again, and in the next instant, the red aura began to appear around her arms.

"You really think I will let you use that? I know you are dangerous like them." Derik smirked as he quickly hit Minny's arm as hard as it could, breaking it on the pot. The red aura around her arm disappeared in the next moment.

Grabbing Minny by the back of her collar, Derik soon broke her other arm as well, making sure she wouldn't be able to resist. Intense pain seeped through Minny, making her cry out loud.

"Don't worry, I won't kill you because I need you after all," Derik said with a smile, "But don't try anything like that again. Otherwise, there will be a lot more pain."

Having never experienced anything like that before, Minny was shocked to the point that she didn't even dare think of anything.

"How could you!? how could you do that to a little girl?!" Jessica screamed at the top of her lungs in anger.

Lucia, looking towards her, was concerned for her newfound friend.

'Is she going to do it again? Like she did when we were fighting against those robots? But if she does it here, in the middle of the vampire crops base. With all the fighting, I'm sure they will be here soon if you do that here...you could lose your life!' Lucia thought.

However, she understood because she was beyond enraged at this vampire in front of her. 'Just take them out quickly.' Lucia thought.

A bust of energy enveloped Jessica's body, and as she stared straight at Derik, one of her eyes began to glow yellow.

# Chapter 1639: Coward

The Vampire Corps actually worked on a shift basis. There would be those that lived on the barracks closer to the wall and lived on-site—protecting the place from any incoming dangers, like the beast wave they had faced earlier in the day.

Then, there would be those who were allowed to live in the city nearby. They would just have to come to work in the daytime. Essentially, every member of the vampire Corps unit had two living quarters.

One temporary when staying at the barracks and the other in the city, a permanent home for them and their family. Of course, there were also other humans and vampires in the city who weren't part of the Corps; they just generally lived there as citizens would.

At the moment, all of the new recruits were living in temporary accommodation at the barracks. It was usual far many recruits to leave in the first few months of the conscription, thus, the Corps unit wanted to make sure if they were willing to commit to their new duties before giving them permanent homes in the city.

However, the Vampire Corps didn't assign the new recruits with any roles or duties yet; this will come in the following week, and for now, they will be under Lieutenant Mitchell's command. This meant, right now, they didn't exactly have to stay put in the rooms assigned to them, as long as they would be there in the morning when Mitchell arrived.

With this information, Hannah had decided to head into the city, where the other corps members lived. She had sent out a message wishing to meet up with the other red vampires working in the base.

She was trying to find out and share the information with the other members. Not everyone from the red vampires knew witnessed morning incidents since some were in the barracks or on other duty, but this did allow them to meet up without being seen or creating any suspicion.

Hannah had gone out on her own, which was why she was surprised to see that only one of her men was left behind when she returned to the room.

"What happened?" Hannah asked. "Where did Derik and the others go?"

The red vampire seemed nervous. He had somewhat expected Derik to come back by now and for Hannah to find out nothing about this, but for some reason, the latter was delayed.

"Tell me!" Hannah demanded as she stomped over to the vampire side. It looked like she was ready to lash out at her fellow member, but he soon flinched.

"I'll tell you. Derik said he had a plan to keep the new vampire under control, and the others went with him...but I was too scared to go there. I mean, they haven't returned yet. Do you think that that vampire has done something to them!"

Hearing this, Hannah felt steam coming from the top of her head, not just because of Derik's actions behind her back, but what this could mean for them. Like the red vampire in front of her, Hannah was more afraid of the vampire she had invited to join them after seeing what happened today.

At first, she was excited, but now after knowing what Derik had done, she felt frustrated because she knew this could be a grave mistake. If they were to make one wrong move or one wrong decision, she could see it: that vampire can get rid of them in a heartbeat.

'The name of the red vampires...it doesn't even scare that person..just who is he?' Hannah thought as she was already rushing towards the other building towards the room of the other group.

———

Inside the room, every time Jessica looked towards the injured Minny, her blood boiled at every passing moment. This time, she was the one that initiated the attack, as she used her small daggers to produce two blood swipes towards the other vampires.

She knew that they weren't the most significant concern but were a problem that needed to be dealt with. Out of instinct, the two vampires performed a blood swipe; however, Derik knew which attack would win out.

The yellow energy broke right through the red aura and continued hitting the two of them in the chest. It hit their armour and caused quite the deep wound, permanently creating a mark. It was only one attack, but suddenly, the tides had turned.

'That damned vampire, are none of them in this group normal? Derik thought. 'How the hell, and why do they have a fucking dhampir travelling with them?'

Derik knew fighting against a dhampir was always an uphill battle for vampires, and using the red aura against them was like trying to use fire to get rid of water.

'She did it again, and she's quite a bit stronger in this form as well.' Lucia thought as she watched from the sides, as it was the only thing she really could do.

When they were attacked in the hotel room, the some thing happened before, but Lucia decided to keep it a secret and guessed that this was the reason why Jessica had left the Vampire Corps.

A dhampir being in the Vampire Corps unit was unheard of. In the first place, how was it even possible? Was Jessica really a dhampir? Because looking at Jessica, there was something different about her compared to the other dhampir which Lucy has come across in her life.

The most noticeable fact was that only a single eye would light up yellow. If she really was a dhampir, how did she suppress her urge like the others? She was travelling with vampires but never once showed any aggression towards them.

'The single eye, is she something else, like a half of a dhampir or something? Either way, all of this fighting must have brought others' attention, and if the other Corps members see her in this state... ' Lucia started to inch her way to the door to make sure she could buy time in case that exact thing happened.

Luckily, or unluckily, all of the new recruits were placed close together in the same apartment block-like building. Although some had heard the noise of fighting, they were unsure if it was an everyday thing here, and even those that were worried didn't know who to report to or what they should do.

So the response was slow compared to the other areas.

With the new energy rising in her, Jessica's arm started to heal somewhat, and eventually, she could use both daggers again. As she held them up, they were both coated in the aura; the only thing was they weren't the same colour. One dagger was covered in the usual red vampire aura, while the other was yellow, indicating dhampir aura.

"Let go of hell" Jessica shouted as she charged forward.

Immediately, Derik knew he had no chance and needed to dodge. He let go of Minny, and she fell on the floor. Now getting both his hands ready, Derik incased them with a red aura. As soon as he sent his first attack, everyone heard a crash and Jessica's dagger was slightly pushed back.

Jessica was somewhat surprised by this, but she still had the other dagger. When she went to attack this time, and her dagger clashed against Darik's hand, unfortunately, it seemed like their power was equal as they both stayed mid-air.

"I see you are quite surprised. Did you think all vampires were so weak against the dhampirs or something? Derik said. "I'm afraid you have no clue about my ability because my punches get stronger and stronger with each successful hit on your body."

Derik was getting ready to throw another punch, but he felt something wrap around his leg and could see no dagger in Jessica's hand. As he threw out his fist, his leg was pulled, throwing him off balance and causing his punch to miss and Jessica's dagger to go right through his forearm.

She had increased the yellow aura to force the dagger right through the blood hardened coating Derik had created on his forearm.

"You're not the only one with an ability," Jessica said.

Seeing how the fight was getting under control, Lucia was quite amazed.

Thus, instead of heading for the door, she stepped towards Minny to see if the latter was okay, but someone stomped inside the room just as she moved.

"What..what the hell is going on here?!" It was Hannah.

"Hannah!" Derik called out. "It's a Dhampir! A dhampir has infiltrated the Red Vampires; help me!"
