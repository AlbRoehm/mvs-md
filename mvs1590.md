# Chapter 1590 - Red Fury

On the very top tier of the Graylash ship, there was a golden temple larger than any of the others. Only the highest ranking members of the Graylash family would reside there. They were in charge of most of the important day-to-day decisions, among them, making sure to keep the main ship in order, keep the peace on the various Graylash planets, as well as keeping the Graylash family in order.

In the centre of the temple, there was a true garden compared to Lucia's. It had large ponds flowing, greenery all around and even a beautiful pink cherry blossom tree. Sitting crossed legged in the middle of it was a young adult with long, straight black hair.

"I'm sorry to interrupt your mediation, Master Zinon, but I have important information that I needed to bring to your attention." An older gentleman, whose beard was almost touching the ground, informed the Graylash family leader.

"You usually only call upon me when there is a need for me to fight someone. Is today any different?" Zinon asked, opening his left eye.

"Well." The man paused as he struggled with what to say. "Mrs Song has brought a few guests with her, and she wishes for you to meet them. However, they aren't just any guests. It's a group of vampires, and the reason I've come to you is that one of them is supposedly one of the Original Vampires. One belonging to that of the thirteen families."

Hearing this, his eyebrows rose, and he opened his other eye, before he stood up from the ground. The armour he was wearing clanked a little. The leader had a large chest piece, with a circle in the centre of it that wrapped around the white robes underneath.

He had a feeling that either today was going to be a big eventful day, and it looked like he was somewhat right.

"Did you get an image of him?" Zinon asked.

Swiping his hand, a screen appeared in front of the old man, facing the young man. It was video footage of Quinn arriving in the docking bay on the first tier. The camera was zoomed in on the Celestial Vampire.

With his right hand, Zinon expanded something with his fingers, and several photos came up. All of them had different faces. He quickly glanced between the two of them, checking for any matches.

"It doesn't look like his face matches up with any of the Originals we know of or anyone from back then. Although I made a quick check with the vampire we have on file while also cross referencing his face through the system, but he could be one that has woken up." Zinon theorised.

"That might be the case, though I'm afraid that they might be Dhampirs who have managed to trick Lucia somehow." The old man stated.

Nodding along, Zinon agreed that to be another possibility.

"She is a kind-hearted girl, but she is too focused on the past. Perhaps they have learned of this and have tricked her."

"She reminds me a lot of you in a way." The old man commented with a slight smile, and Zinon helplessly scratched the head of his back, unable to refute that claim.

"Thank you for informing me. I will set out and test them myself. It is too dangerous if anyone else goes out, and if Lucia were to get hurt, I would feel incredibly guilty." With that said, Zinon pressed the centre of his chest, and two large wings sprouted from his back.

What he currently had on his chest was a Demon tier piece of armour. This item, along with the Graylash leader's personal strength, meant that the old man wasn't too worried about him going out on his own. Against a single person, the elder honestly believed that there was nobody that could defeat the current master of the Graylash family, even if it truly turned out to be an Original Vampire.

———

Flying over to Lucia's house, Zinon immediately spotted the individual he had seen on the screen. He decided to give that person a little test to verify whether that was the truth. However, before he ever got the chance to, that person released such a scary amount of aura that it nearly overwhelmed the Graylash leader.

'What is this feeling? Am I scared of him? Is this the power of an Original? How's that possible? They were never described to be this strong! Just who is this person? Could he be the leader of Dhampirs? No, they always address her as some Queen, so it can't be her?' Zinon's mind tried to come up with a reasonable explanation of who Quinn might be.

Having felt the pressure, Lucia stormed out from the house. Not just that, but she could somewhat see it around him. Like a soft red flame that looked like it be covering his entire body.

"What happened?" Lucia asked.

"I have no clue!" Jessica replied. "That guy just appeared out of nowhere, and he seems to have done something to make Nate furious."

The two girls looked towards Peter wondering if he had an answer.

"Those wings…" Peter muttered, starting to recognise them. "Are they a Demon tier item?"

Hearing Peter ask this, it was then that Lucia noticed who the other person was.

"It's the Graylash family leader, Zinon! What is he doing here?"

Although it didn't answer his question, Peter thought that it might just be a resemblance. After all, with a millennium having passed, it shouldn't come as a surprise that humans would have gathered multiple Demon tier items compared to before.

In general, everyone's equipment should have been better, just because it looked like someone that was dear to them, didn't necessarily mean that there was a correlation.

However, Quinn seemed to think differently. He took a single step forward and the tingling feeling they could all feel grew stronger inside their bodies.

"Tell me, what is that you are wearing!" Quinn demanded to know.

He had used his Influence skill, however, just like with the other humans, all the Graylash members had trained in Qi. Zinon blocked the attempt and had covered his mind just in case.

For Quinn, he didn't need to use his Inspect skill. Ever since evolving, he had become able to feel the different energies around him. Now that he was at a hundred percent he could feel all the surrounding energies, and he could tell that the energy of the armour was strong.

"If you're going to be aggressive like that, then I have no choice!" Zinon mumbled.

His large wings started to electrify, turning blue, and with a single flap of his wings, several zaps of lighting came out, accompanied by metallic sharp feathers at the end of it. Moving ever so slightly, Quinn was avoiding each one.

However, there was far too much lighting for him to block it completely. With his finger held out, the Celestial Vampire quickly shot out several Blood bullets towards each of the lighting strikes. Numerous feathers fell to the ground, yet one of the lightning feathers came straight towards Quinn's forehead.

Blood started to cover the vampire's hand. The red glow could be seen on it again as the red power flowed through his veins. Lifting his hand, he caught the lightning feather. It continued to strike him with power, but it didn't seem to have an effect on him.

The next second, holding the feather, Quinn threw it back, right towards Zinon. Seeing this, the young man closed his wings, shielding himself. He knew his wings were strong and almost indestructible. However, when Quinn had thrown the projectile back, he had added a bit of his blood aura, and started to spiral the back of the feather giving it a boost towards the person in front of him.

When the feather hit, it pierced right through the Demon tier wing, going through it and injuring Zinon's shoulder.

"AHHH!" The Graylash leader let out a scream. 'How did that get through?!'

"NATE! YOU HAVE TO STOP!" Lucia screamed. "HE'S THE GRAYLASH LEADER!!!"

It was then Quinn moved from one side of the open area and now was directly in front of Zinon who still had his wings held up.

"I missed your head on purpose." Quinn stated. "As for your title and position… I don't care."

Opening up the palm of his hand, a red beam could be seen. It looked similar to that of the red Blood cannon, and the next second it left his hand, hitting the wings and sending Zinon off his feet.

The red beam continued to make contact, and pushed the leader through the walls of the house, and continued to go until it had hit the wall of a mountain on the other side just opposite the house.

The young man was seriously hurt, wondering where this monster had come from.

'I've never heard or seen anyone who has this strength… No… could he be that Laxmus?' Zinon thought.

When opening his eyes, and climbing through the walls, he could see Quinn was already in front of him, and before he could say anything his fingers were wrapped around Zinon's throat.

"Right now, I can feel the blood completely running through your veins! I can make them pop at any second! Now tell me, what did you do to Vorden!" Quinn shouted, tightening his grip.

Asking this question, images appeared in his head. The first time he had met his friend at the military academy. Despite having been a prodigy from an important family, he had always stuck up for him and Peter, who had been regarded as nothing but wastrels. Although it had practically been suicide, he had gone through the teleporter without hesitation when Quinn had been pushed through it on to a dangerous planet.

The first true friend he had made… and now, his body, or at least the body of Tails, the Humanoid Demon tier beast he had been in control of, was nothing more than a weapon.

Lifting his hands, Zinon was trying to show that he meant no harm.

"PLEASE NATE, STOP!" Lucia shouted at the top of her lungs. "I brought you here because I thought I could trust you! Please! You said you were friends with our Graylash family, right?!"

Hearing those words, it had caused Quinn to calm down a little and he loosened his grip.

"You..You..said Vorden, right?" Zinon questioned, now that he could breathe a little again. "So you really are someone from back then… someone from the Cursed faction."

Hearing those words, Quinn completely let go of Zinon.

*****

# Chapter 1591 - A Bond Of Trust
Since waking up from the deep slumber, Quinn had never heard of anyone who knew what the Cursed faction was. He hadn't spoken to many, but still, to not hear anything about Cursed Faction, with even people not remembering about it, he had lost all hope until now.

"Speak," Quinn said, still a bit short and still angry at what the man was currently wearing.

"You…you said the name Vorden, correct," Zinon replied while still adjusting his neck. When the strange Vampire had him held, he felt all of the blood in his body rush to his neck, and although he couldn't see, there was a red ring around his neck where Quinn had held him.

It was not because of the pressure of the grip but because of something else. There was one thing that Zinon knew for sure: he needed to tread carefully.

"That name, he was one of those from the Cursed faction. I studied them well; if you are an original from back then like you claimed, then perhaps you two were friends." Zinon continued; it was clear he was fishing for answers and confirmations.

"Just tell me, what is that armour you are wearing right now? Is it Vorden!" Quinn demanded to know, still frustrated.

The others had rushed out of the house, and the two women, a little frightened, had decided to stay back a little, but Peter and Minny continued forward while Minny ran straight up to Quinn's leg and grabbed onto it.

"Please…please don't hurt the bird, please stop fighting!" She said as she continued to sob and cry, which had managed to somewhat cool Quinn's head.

Seeing this and the little girl, a young vampire, along with such a man, Zinon decided to take his chances.

"This armour was gifted from the Cursed faction to the Graylash family. We had a close connection in the past; you must know that, so I ask you to trust me. Please, if you want to know more, then follow me…and we can talk." Zinon suggested.

Looking at the others' frightened faces, especially for the woman who had come along with him, Quinn thought he should calm down a little bit. After all, he was a guest, and as the man in front of him stated, this was the Graylash faction. They were not the enemy. At least that's what he hoped. Either way, if he found out something he didn't like, it wasn't exactly like there was anyone that could stop him.

The group started to follow Zinon up the mountain. There were thousands of stairs to the top level. Before that, he had also informed the others that there was nothing to worry about, at least for now.

Since somewhat of a fight had broken out, he was sure they would soon be coming to look. In the end, they had reached the large temple, and standing outside were countless guards wearing large pieces of armour as Quinn had seen before.

They were lined in a row on either side to the temple, and their armour was gold and white compared to the others he had seen. Another thing to note was that these guards also wore a helmet with two wings on the top of the head. He also noticed that their choice of weapon was a spear, similar to Lucia.

Many elders in white robes rushed towards him when entering the large temple. Unlike the guards outside, they didn't wear any large and heavy armour.

"Master, you brought them in. Does that mean-"

Before the elder could ask his question, Zinon shook his head.

"There is still more we both have to learn. I shall take him to my chambers for now."

With that said, the others bowed down, but they did notice the state their master was in; his face was covered with dirt, and blood was flushed on his shoulders. The elders also took note of others with him, and to their surprise, none of them looked like they fought.

"Just in case, get everyone to be on standby." One of the elders whispered to the others.

Now in front of the group were two large doors. It was the Graylash leader's main room.

"Is it okay if the two of you waited outside?" Zinon said when looking at Lucia and Jessica.

"Are you serious!" Jessica said. "After coming all this way, you two are going to talk about the past. I want to know what happened to…I mean, who doesn't want to know about the Great War?!"

"I understand," Zinon said with a smile. "However, there might be some things which, if revealed, must not escape this room. Please understand."

The door was then pushed open and immediately stepped out of the room were two of the golden guards that Quinn saw when entering the temple. Peter, Minny and Quinn headed inside. While the girls were forced to wait outside and the guards would make sure of it.

Inside the room, there was a large bed, but at the same time, there were several pieces of paper, computer servers, screens and more. It wasn't what Quinn was expecting at all, and the number one face he could see scattered all over the room was Owen.

It seemed like Quinn might have come to the right place after all.

"First, if you are who you say you are, one of the originals, then please, could you tell me when you went into a slumber. How long after the great war? How long after the battle between Graham and Quinn?"

It was starting to annoy Quinn; it seemed like everyone he met had their own set of questions before he could even ask his own. Still, for now, he would play along.

"I went into slumber right after the battle," Quinn answered. "So I know nothing about what happened after, which is why I wanted to ask my own questions."

Zinon gave Quinn a look as if he could tell he was somewhat lying, or at least holding something back. He then swiped his hand up, and a screen appeared on the back wall, which revealed the faces of all the vampires who fought during the war.

"These are the faces of the vampires that took part in the war. All of those were caught on camera back then!" Zinon said. "Your face matches none of them. I'm not saying you aren't an original; you might have been sleeping. In fact, many don't know this, but the vampires that took part in the war were just regular leaders; they weren't any originals at all!

"You have to be honest with me. You want to know about the Cursed faction, but I have to trust you before I can tell you anything. I need to know who you are. Over the years, we have made countless enemies, and as the leader, I have the responsibility of everyone in the Graylash Family.

"Let me tell you something: when you had my life in your hands, I didn't tell you about the Cursed faction because I was scared, but because I thought you might be able to help me, tell me information that I need to know."

When hearing Zinon talk, Quinn could understand. The weight that a leader carries. He had held it for a long time, and now he felt like crap. Crap for leaving them and having this happen to them all.

"Fine," Quinn answered. "If you wish to know who I am, then so be it. You said you wanted to trust; then this should give you enough trust."

Quinn lifted his hand and slightly pressed his face with a finger. A slight crack appeared on his cheek, and it slowly spread throughout his face.

Slowly, the parts of the mud began to fall off on the floor, slowly revealing Quinn's real face. His hair suddenly began to grow longer until they reached up to his waist, and within a few moments, Quinn successfully removed the disguise, and his real face was fully revealed.

"I am Quinn Talen, Leader of the Cursed faction, and once King of the Vampires." He declared.

******

# Chapter 1592 - The Great Graylash Leader
At some point, Quinn knew that he would have to reveal himself, but with him being a legendary figure and still not entirely understanding the current state of the world and how it came to be, he felt it was easier for him to hide for the time being.

However, with how things were now, it was quicker to get straight to the point, and just by showing his face to one person, he could gauge the reaction of the others. Now that he had finally revealed himself, he could see the look on Zinon's face - one that was of speechlessness.

His mouth was left wide open, and his eyes dilated to the point they looked like they would fall out of its sockets. He stood frozen on the spot and didn't say anything for a long moment.

'Well, it looks like he can recognise me.' Quinn thought, a little worried that he might not have done. After all, all of Quinn's statues on the Graylash planet were similar to his look before final evolution when he was the leader of the Cursed faction, not when he had defeated Graham, which was his current appearance.

The latter was revealed only briefly to the world.

The next second, and lifting up his hand, Zinon slapped himself across the check, which resounded through the room, and his face turned red, showing he hadn't held back.

"The Hero…after all this time, has returned and is still alive," Zinon uttered, falling to his knees. "The world thought you had died, why..why did it take you so long to come back finally."

That was an awkward question for the group to answer, one they were trying to figure out themselves.

"It has been some strange circumstances, but thousand years ago, after defeating Graham, I went into a slumber, and these two were also with me. We just woke up, and the world is like it is now. I need to know what happened; I need to know what the Cursed faction is like. You said you knew them, by name and their faces, what they looked like, and how did you know how I looked?" Quinn asked.

There were numerous questions, and knowing that such an important person was asking them, Zinon had to regain his composure, but it was almost impossible as he kept staring towards Quinn; soon though, the screen on the wall of his chamber had changed.

It had changed into something Quinn was familiar with. It showed Quinn in the air, tornados of blood around him, while Graham was on the ground.

"This was the footage captured a thousand years ago of that fight," Zinon explained. "The past leaders and I have watched it many, many times over again. The faces of all those that were involved in the war back then, those that had saved our lives, the Graylash leader at the time, Owen Graylash, made sure that at least our family line would remember it."

Zinon paused the video right on Quinn's face and looked towards the man in front of him. He turned his head several times, making sure they were the same person, and without a doubt, he confirmed that they were the same.

"Even if the whole world was to forget, no matter what, the Graylash family will remember. These were Owen's words. I'll do my best to explain what has happened since you've been gone. However, I'm afraid I can only explain it from the Graylash family point of view, and you will soon understand why."

The video screen started to change, showing a timeline of sorts. A celebration took place in all of the Shelters after the war. The planets being taken over, and the statues of Quinn being built.

"At the time, Owen was the leader of the Graylash family, and after the war, he focused on building up the Shelters on each of the planets they owned. Thanks to the Cursed faction, relations with the vampires were developing by the day.

"In the end, the Graylash faction was also able to claim land in the vampire solar system, which is where we are today. It was on the condition that we were to allow the vampires to live here, which Owen, of course, accepted and had planned to do so anyway.

"The Graylash family chose to stay away from the troubles on Earth, so there was not much known about it or much details about what was happening. All we do know is the Cursed faction and the Earthborn group were doing their best to resolve matters, and in the end, it seemed like they had somewhat succeeded.

"However, the Graylash group didn't feel the need to go back to the Earth's solar system. We had found our own place here and continued to live our lives away from the others."

So far, the story sounded like there was peace after the war. The troubles on Earth might have been related to Pure.

"Did Leo and Sera complete their mission? Did they get rid of Pure?" Quinn asked.

"Pure…" Zinon paused for a moment before adding, "I do not know the people that you spoke of, I only remembered the names of those that were with you in the fight against Graham. Which is why I knew of the name Vorden. But yes, Pure is an organisation that is currently still rampant on Earth..and in fact, they have the support of half of the humans living in earth's solar system."

Over half came as a big shock, but it was also clear that Zinon didn't know the details of why this came to be, only the result of what had happened. It also made Quinn wonder if Zero was still alive.

"It's a worry, as there are also supporters of Pure currently on our own planets. However, many supported the Hero's ideals and chose to follow Owen Graylash's wishes above all. Which is why, even now, we accept the vampires." Zinon explained.

"The cursed faction though, what happened to the Cursed faction? Why has everyone forgotten about them?" Quinn asked.

Upon hearing this, there was a concerned and pained look on Zinon's face.

"Do you know, Owen was still alive when I was a child? He was my Grandfather, I didn't just know him by name, but I knew him in person. He would tell me countless stories about you, Quinn.

"You might be wondering how he was able to stay alive. Due to mastering Qi, those who excel at it can slow down the ageing process significantly, and he was someone who had managed to excel at it more so than any other Graylash before him. I believe he had reached the age of 800 and over when he passed, he wasn't even a vampire and it was believed he was the first human of his kind to make that achievement then there was my father, and now there is me, at the age of two hundred and so, but I won't tell you the full number. That's right, between my time and yours, only three generations of leaders have enacted."

It was hard to believe the words of the person in front of him, since he looked like a young man, but why would he have a reason to lie, and he had heard the effects of Qi like this before, he just didn't know they would work to this extent.

"Quinn, your goal and my goal are similar, so you might be able to find out what happened to the Cursed faction and why. Pure, although strong, wasn't a significant threat to the Cursed faction or the Vampire settlement. Everything changed when an influx of dhampirs started to appear.

"That all started when Owen Graylash died. No one knows how he died, but it was in this very room that I am in now. His heart had stopped, and the higher-ups told the public that it was due to his old age, but I don't believe that fact at all. You see, Owen continued to make strides in Qi. He had become fascinated with the power. He was still strong and healthy; in fact, he had even comprehended how to take life force from the things around him."

Hearing this reminded Quinn of what he had seen Zero do. All those dry bodies, having their lives drained out of them.

'The life drain skill will allow a human to live indefinitely.' Ray answered. 'If anyone has truly mastered that, they can take the life not just from other humans but even plants or beasts around them to increase their time here. No wonder humans managed to live for so long.'

"That is why I believe he was murdered. I have more reasons than one for this, but the main reason is that all the chaos in this world was triggered by my grandfather Owen's death.

That's when the group of dhampirs began to come out and reveal themselves. Something strange is happening, Quinn. When I heard that someone was still alive from back then, I hoped they were close to my grandfather. I was hoping they might know who could have killed him, but I guess not.

"Still, I will tell you what I know about the Cursed faction and even help you on your quest, as long as you can help me. I request you to please find who killed my grandfather, Owen Graylash."

[New quest received]

[Find the murderer of Owen]

[Quest reward:???]

'Oh, it's the first Quest of my new system.' Quinn thought, but there were still plenty of questions he needed answering, and he still had a lot to hear about.

*******

# Chapter 1593 - A Warning
As Quinn advanced through the levels of his old System, the number of Quests he would receive decreased in rate, and this also assured him that the System was close to its max level. There wasn't much it could teach him, nor were there as many challenges to help Quinn grow.

Yet, he had finally received a new quest from the System. Another thing to note is that this one seemed like a chain quest. To find out what happened to Owen? Does this mean that the quest was over if Quinn figured out Owen had died of natural causes instead of being murdered?

Also, how did the System know that someone murdered Owen? If that was the case, how would the System even know that in the first place? Either way, these quests were a lot harder than actually surviving a fight or something along those lines.

Which was why he was hoping with an upgraded system that the rewards he would receive would be better too.

'The System is a bit addictive… It's like I am getting a present when I get these rewards. Even though I don't know what it will be, I am always a bit excited to get them.' Quinn thought.

Regardless of this, Quinn could see he had completed most of his previous quests, all apart from one that was.

[Learn more about the Talen family]

'Why hasn't this quest been completed? Even when I ask so many questions about the past, this quest just never seems to conclude.' Quinn thought.

It wasn't an important matter though, and he had more important questions to ask in front of him.

"I can't make any promises just yet, and I think that you should be able to understand I need to know what happened to myself and the others. If it's true, like you said, that the two things are linked, then, of course, I will help. Owen was a really good friend of mine." Quinn answered.

Hearing this had put a smile on Zinon's face.

"The Cursed Faction's influence started to dwindle when those from earth seemed to become a blur of one group. To put it simply, the world didn't need someone like the Cursed faction anymore, but it seemed like that was very wrong. As I said, after Owen's death, the Dhampirs started to appear.

"I heard that they attempted to hunt the vampires till the very end. The Vampire Corps did a good job, but as for the rest of them, my theory is the Cursed faction were being hunted as they were the ones who brought the two sides together. Unfortunately, the Graylash group had the vampires here to worry about." Zinon explained.

"Honestly, at around the same time, when the Dhampirs appeared, the Cursed faction seemingly went into hiding."

"Hiding." Quinn quickly repeated. "You mean they're not dead; they just have gone into hiding because of the Dhampirs?"

There was hope yet again.

"Please bear in mind, a lot of this happened when I was not leader, and I only took over not too long ago. I have to add that the hiding factor is my own theory. There's a high probability that Dhampirs may have already hunted them."

This fact was true, and Quinn wasn't sure if they would even stay alive for that long. Maybe because the Cursed faction felt like the world no longer needed them since there was no existential threat, many lived out their lives and went to eternal sleep.

All for the Dhhampires to start their attack then, it could also be something that was just timed too well or a coincidence, though the latter part was quite improbable.

"I have a reason to believe that theory. After the Dhampirs appeared, there was a time when it looked like they would come to the Graylash family planets. However, when those on Earth increased pressure on their forces, they had made a deal with us.

"They will not bother us, and we must not interfere with the matters of Earth. It might have been a bad decision, but my father and I agreed to the deal. And because of this, our people have been able to live relatively peaceful lives. However, I think the cursed faction is alive due to the armour that was given to me by your friend.

"The person was named Sam. I believe you should know him as he played a big part in the Cursed faction. He was the one that gifted the armour. My theory of them being hunted is because of what he said. The world was after more potent weapons, and many knew about a piece of information regarding a place where two humanoid demon tier beasts were present.

"It came as a surprise to me that this armour came from him. I'm sorry, I honestly never knew."

'Sam was the one that gave him the armour. Does that mean Vorden is dead…and it might also mean that Sam is still alive?'

"How long ago was this? When did Sam give you the armour?" Quinn asked.

"It was originally given to my father, just after Owen had passed. This is why I believe this whole mess is linked, and the Cursed faction might actually know more about this than the others. If you are asking where they are...I do not know."

If Sam had appeared after Owen's death, it meant that it was around 200 years ago. It was still a long time, and a lot could have happened. However, if Sam visited the Graylash family, it also meant Sam was alive for a long time, even after Quinn's fight with Graham.

"It's a good thing that you kept your face hidden. If the dhampirs were to know that you were alive, Quinn, I'm sure they would destroy every planet you stepped foot on to find you, a force as strong as them...and you still hold the strength you did in the past. If you can...I will suggest that you find them before they can come to you."

Honestly, Quinn was already planning on it, he had one more place he wished to visit to see if he could find the Cursed faction first, trying to figure out what had occurred, but if he still couldn't get any answers, then it was time for him to be the assailant for once. He would march right into wherever the dhampirs were and ask them what happened to the Cursed faction since they seemed to be the problem of them all.

Still, the Dhampirs also had to be strong enough for the Graylash family not to make a move, and even those on Earth have yet to get rid of them.

"If you don't mind me asking, where do you plan to go next?" Zinon asked.

It didn't take long for Quinn to respond.

"There is one member of the Cursed faction that is still alive. I'm going to see Logan Green on Earth and fill in the gaps of history. I'm sure he will know why the Cursed faction went into hiding."

When Quinn answered, he could hear Zinon's heart rate change. It made him wonder why. Was it the name? The place he had decided to go? Or was it something else?

"Quinn, I am thrilled that you are back. I wish I could treat you to any desire you want in the Graylash family. I feel as close a bond with you as my own family, even though I don't know you.

"Even though you nearly killed me as well. This is how much the Graylash family believe they are indebted to you. So when I speak, please know that I am not trying to be rude to you; however, I wish to give you a word of warning.

"The Vampire Corps is very trustworthy, but as for Logan Green... Have you ever thought that if the Cursed faction were being hunted or had gone into hiding, why Logan Green hasn't? Not only that, but somehow he has become a public figure and yet still, no dhampirs have attempted to attack him so openly like they had done the others.

"As I said, something big is going on in this world...and my advice would be not to trust Logan Green."

*******

# Chapter 1594 - Its Yours To Keep
Before leaving the chamber, Quinn had asked as many questions as he could about the current state of the world, the Cursed faction, or if there was anything else that he had missed. Unfortunately, it seemed like there wasn't much information.

The Graylash planets and the main ship were currently in the vampire's solar system, and they had somewhat made it their base. What used to be known as the beast solar system was a mixed bag, and Earth's solar system was in the worst state, filled with most of the ongoing conflicts.

Quinn did, however, find out more about the vampires. If the thirteen families were still alive or their tombs existed, they would probably be in the current solar system.

Nearly all of the thirteen family vampires resided in this part of the solar system rather than the beast part, even if the Graylash family owned those planers. Quinn felt like he somewhat would believe this since he himself was found on one of the Graylash planets.

After their conversation came to an end, Peter had gone on to make another mud mask for Quinn. Zinon had promised that he would keep Quinn's identity a secret. And it looked like it was best for Quinn to meet Logan by surprise rather than alerting the latter beforehand.

'Logan…I can't believe it. There is no reason for him to change sides. It just makes no sense, but many things haven't made sense since I've arrived. As Zinon said, something is going on.'

"Can you do me a favour?" Quinn said as he put on the mask and once again took on the appearance of Chucky. "The planet I was on, the location I described-"

"You want me to try to find out who rented the room out, or perhaps who owns the building, correct?" Zinon replied with a smile. "I will try my best to find out for you. I'm sorry I can't help much further, but whatever you need, as long as it's on one of the Graylash planets, I will be happy to help you. I just can't believe that the world, after so much time has passed, will need to rely on you again. Because of that, I want to give you something before you leave."

Pressing the centre of his chest, the armour seemed to release some sort of steam as it unbuckled. Quickly Zinon grabbed it and walked over to Quinn.

"Take it...this is not mine in the first place," ZInon said. "You will possibly be going into dangerous territory. I won't lie, but most likely, fate will put you in situations where you will need to fight once again.

"I know you're strong." Zinon touched his injured shoulder. "I know that more than anyone else. However, the enemy is as well. While you were away, they built up strength, with next to no resistance.

"Qi, Crystals, beast gear...all of these things have changed from your time to now. Even our Graylash family, who was proud of their ability, had to resort to using strong beast gear to enhance our powers."

Honestly, Quinn initially wanted to reject the idea, but since there was a chance this was a piece of Vorden, someone he cared about, he didn't because he wanted to bring a part of him along with him.

When he placed it around his chest, the armour attached itself around the back.

[Demon tier Chest piece acquired]

[All stats + 60]

[Defence 200]

[Passive skill: Endurance restoration]

[If any part of the armour is damaged in any way, the armour will return to its original state if it is not taken in use for some time.]

[Active skill: Flight]

[While skill is active, the User can fly for as long as the skill is active. Speed is based on the User.]

So far, for a demon tier piece of equipment, Quinn didn't find it too impressive. However, its defence was undoubtedly high, and there wouldn't be many things that could have broken through its wings. At the same time, the restoration skill was unheard of.

Then there was the active skill of flight, which in itself was a skill that was almost as good as an ability. And the last thing was something Quinn had never seen on a piece of armour before.

[Unique active skill]

[The armour can adapt any active skill dependent on the User's ability]

[Unable to process information at this moment]

'This is a first; Did special lightning feathers the armour had produced when Zinon tried to attack me come from this skill? I'm interested to see what this thing can do with my shadow?' Quinn thought.

"I'm happy to know you enjoy the gift." Zinon smiled. "It belongs to you in the first place. You know, in some ways, I feel like when Sam gave the Graylash family that piece of armour, he might have known it would come back to you."

Thinking about what Sam's character was like, Quinn didn't doubt that.

"You have been a big help. Thank you for looking after the vampires. If you need anything, or anything comes up, I will contact you."

"One last favour," Zinon said. "About Lucia, she is interested in knowing how a man in the Graylash family had died. Similar to how we passed down stories of you. In her family, they passed down stories of the greatest Graylash member from her family. If you know anything… Well, I will let you decide what to do.

"However, my wish is for her not to get hung up in the past and to enjoy her life. I believe that she will have nothing to worry about by your side. I'm not asking you to protect her, but maybe show her more of this life."

For once, it was a more normal request, and hearing this, Quinn did feel a little guilty. His actions from a thousand years ago had affected the poor girl and her family.

He could at least help them out.

Zinon then gave a small communication device to Quinn. It was a wristwatch of some sort, similar to those they would use in the military. It worked similar to a phone, and the two could contact each other whenever they wished.

It was good because many technology devices Quinn had with him were outdated and not functional anymore.

As the three of them walked out of the chamber doors, they found the girls talking amongst each other.

Quinn had been in the chamber for a long time because there was much to learn and hear.

"You're back!" Jessica said, somewhat smiling but then quickly put the smile away. "I mean, I thought that the two of you might have gotten into a fight again, so I was a little worried when guys were in the room for so long. Anyway, what did you talk about?"

"Wait for a second, what is that!" Lucia said, pointing at his chest, at the beast armour Quinn had recently acquired.

"Wait, isn't that what we saw on the Graylash leader?" Jessica said, surprised as well. "What did you do to make him let you keep that?"

Quinn was thinking about what to say. According to Zinon, not many would recognise it, as Zinon hardly used it outside of the main ship, but of course, these two would know about the armour piece.

"It was in return for a request," Peter replied. "The Graylash leader once used to be his little dog, so he gave us this to make it easier for us."

Surprisingly, Peter was the one to save the day.

"A task, the Graylash leader gave you a task to do? Something that he can't do himself." Lucia repeated.

"He has several planets to run. He is a busy person," Quinn said and realised now with the way he was, with his identity hidden. He was a free person. Most importantly, he was a free person who was no longer a weakling.

"So, what did he ask you to do?" Jessica asked.

"We… We will stick to the plan. Let's head to earth." Quinn stated.

# Chapter 1595 - The Red Heart
Before leaving, Quinn once again gave the option to the other two women who had been following him so far. Whether they wanted to come along or not, he thought it would be handy to have them since they could help point out things in the world that he didn't know yet.

After all, there were certain things that perhaps Zinon had missed. Also, sometimes hearing about things and actually experiencing them themselves are two different things.

"Of course, I'll come. I said I would introduce you to the Vampire Corps in the first place, honestly as well…I wonder if I made the wrong call coming here. I feel like that attack on the Graylash planet was because of me." Jessica answered.

Then there was Lucia; although Zinon had asked Quinn to take her along with him, Quinn wasn't going to take her against her will. It had to be something that she wanted to do. At the same time, this was her home; her family house was also here.

She clenched her spear as she went to make the decision.

"I… will come. You are trying to learn the truth of what happened around your time, and my goal is quite the same. Honestly, I had no path I wished to take, so this will give me one."

Zinon was extremely helpful, giving the small group everything they needed. He had given them a combat ship to travel to whatever planets they wanted and would come across. It was a perfect vessel for around ten members in total, so there was plenty of room for them.

On top of that, he had given enough money for them to have no troubles, although the correct thing to say was he had given the money to Lucia, who would be holding onto it. After finding out she would be going along with them, Zinon had decided the aforementioned.

Currently, the group was on board the ship and headed to the space station that would take them to Earth's solar system. Quinn wanted to explore the other planets here to see the vampires, where the originals were presumed to be, but he would leave that up to the leader Zinon.

'From the first impression I have of him, I think I can trust him…I kind of have to find new people to trust now.' Quinn thought.

"So explain why we can't just go straight to Earth?" Peter asked Jessica.

Quinn and the others were quite surprised that they were going to Mars, even though Earth was where they knew Logan to be present currently.

"Can you please just leave this stuff to us? Don't you trust us?" Jessica complained, with her arms folded, "At the moment, there are four or three groups that are on Earth, and unless you are a part of one of them, then we can't join. Not without permission."

"Not even I, being a high member of the Graylash family, would be able to set foot on earth," Lucia added. "Especially since the agreement between our family, which is why the best option is for Jessica to use her contacts."

There was a smug smile on Jessica's face as she heard her name being used, but to be honest, she wasn't sure how much help she could be. After all, she was just a standard member of the Vampire Corps, and she wasn't special in any way, unlike Lucia. This meant when they got there, it all depended on how convincing 'Nate' and his friends could be.

'I'll keep this bit to myself, though… If they find out that I can't really help, is there any point in me being here? It will feel just like it did when I was in the Vampire Corps.' Jessica thought while looking at the others as they made their way to Mars.

Going through the space station was an easy task. Also, Quinn didn't know that the wristwatch given to all three of them by a Graylash elder before they left the Graylash planet also acted as an ID card for them. And now, Quinn's name engraved in the database was Nate Snell, the same alias that Quinn had used before.

Since no one seemed to know the names of the Cursed Faction, apart from those obsessed with the events, like Zinon, he thought using the name Nate Snell, was sure to grab the attention of those from the past, if they did know who the real Nate was, this might help Quinn without having to reveal his real identity.

Finally, they could see the planet Mars in the distance, which was now wholly terraformed into a planet similar to the Earth, except for the surface, which contained a tinge of redness.

In Earth's solar system, they hadn't terraformed the other planets yet, other than the Shelters on the different beast planets which were in a different solar system, so seeing this the way it was, was quite a surprise.

"It doesn't look like there is much fighting on here?" Peter said as the ship approached what looked like a megacity of some kind. It looked like a modern city similar to the Graylash planet.

"Remember when we used to learn about different nations and countries?" Lucia commented. "Currently, Mars is similar to that. There are different parts of the planet that individual groups regulate. Pure also owns a part of it, so do Logan Green and the Vampire Corps. However, Logan Green and the Vampire Corps areas overlap each other. Since the two work with each other.

"There are fights here and there, but a full war hasn't broken out on these planets. War isn't beneficial to anyone. It's clear to the others that either side is waiting for something. Either the enemy attacks first, or perhaps they are in search of something that will guarantee them victory if there is a war."

Quinn understood this very well. In the past, with the big four, it was similar. When there were several big powers, they knew that a war would just wipe them both out, and that wasn't something any of them desired - economically or figuratively.

'What does Pure really want…and what are they waiting for?' Quinn wondered.

Landing in the docking bay, the group again had to register themselves. It looked like the planets kept track of who was where and when. Something that didn't happen so much in the past, because of how unorganised everything was. However, this was mainly due to the countless wars and the groups not working together.

'So in theory, all the dhampirs and Pure members should be registered as well since they are currently normal living citizens? They're no longer hiding like they were before.' Quinn realised. 'I really hope Logan is on our side because all of this information would be useful in finding out what is going on and getting rid of the real threat.'

It was late for the group, and Lucia was getting tired, so the group decided that they would rest at a hotel before heading to the Vampire Crops group located in the city.

— — —

A young man was sitting in a chair in a bright white-light room. Several wires were linked to him on the chair itself—cables from all ends leading to several different machines.

Screens, more than one could count, were spread all over the room, but the young man's eyes remained closed as if he was in a deep sleep.

That was until something flashed in his mind, and his eyes twitched a bit.

'A group of vampires have just arrived on mars? Well, that's not the interesting part, but the name... Who would be brave enough to use a name like that...Nate Snell, huh. It seems someone is feeling lucky enough to irritate me today. It couldn't have been them; they would have contacted me beforehand.'

'This pain…it hurts..it hurts a lot. Wait, do I even feel anything anymore.'

When moving part of the shirt around his chest a faint glow could be seen sticking through the material. It was a special crystal that was said to have unlimited power — a Nest Crystal.

'I have to find the red heart before the others...can't afford to have people interfere.'

*****

# Chapter 1596 - Five Stages Of Qi
Since the money that had been gifted to them was apparently quite a lot, the three of them decided to splurge on two nice rooms. The hotel rooms were simply delightful, nicer than anything Quinn had seen during his time.

Many structures in the past, including the Shelters, had to be built quickly using abilities and more. With war, many knew there would be times when these structures could collapse at any time, so luxury was nothing like what Quinn was looking at now.

After being given their key cards, a small little round robot that looked like a moving trash can was showing each one to their rooms, they were close to being on the top floor, and each of the rooms were also placed next to each other. Although next together perhaps wasn't the right word.

The doors were so far apart, that Quinn wouldn't even be able to hear what was being said in the other rooms. Peter, Quinn, and Minnie would be staying in one room, while the two girls would be staying in the other.

"Lucia, do you mind meeting me in my room for a moment, there were a few questions I would like to ask you?" Quinn said.

"Hey, what are you planning to do, and why do you need just her? I thought you would be talking to me!" Jessica complained.

"Well, do you know how to use Qi, and how Qi works?" Quinn asked.

Shaking her head, and a little embarrassed at what she had just said, Jessica decided to just storm off instead. When entering the room. Quinn could see a nice glass window that showed the whole city, and the three luxury beds that had been requested.

When looking around, Quinn also noticed a few things he never expected to see and were still hard to get used to. For one, it was a menu, and on the menu there was blood, also human flesh among other things. It was split into different sections for different people.

"I thought there weren't many vampires here other than those in the Vampire Corps?" Quinn asked, holding the menu.

"There will be a few vampires, but just most that are here are part of the corpse. Remember, they still have their families and more. Hotels are also used for meetings and such, so they have to accommodate these things." Lucia explained.

"At the moment, we are in the Green and Vampire Corps area. Which means there is still a mix of vampires and humans living here. Although, there is also the specific Vampire Corps area. In the Green area the vampires are still discriminated against. So there is an area mainly for vampires.

"There are some living in this area that actually support what the Dhampires and Pure are doing. Which is why most vampires chose to move out of here and head to our Graylash family."

Although it wasn't perfect, Quinn could see how things worked like that. Pure was just a power hungry group in the Celestial Vampire's mind. They just wished to control everything for whatever reason. No matter what, Quinn was never going to be able to get rid of those people.

However, the Dhampirs, it was in their blood to get rid of the vampires. Perhaps if Erin had never lived, then the world would have been able to accept all the races. They would still deal with problems, but all of them could have lived together.

'Crap… did I really just think that Erin would have been better off killed?' Quinn cautioned himself. 'Until I know 100% what's going on, I shouldn't be thinking things like that. Besides… wouldn't I be the one at fault for having turned her in that scenario?'

Sitting on the desk that was by the window, Lucia followed and sat opposite him.

"I want you to tell me how much the people of your era currently know about Qi. During my time, it was rather rare, but nowadays, even random people seem to know enough to be able to prevent vampires from charming them." Quinn requested.

"We've been classifying Qi into five different stages." Lucia answered. "The first stage helps us power the cells in our bodies, making them sturdier, the second stage allows us to encompass something external, like a weapon to give it a power boost. The third stage of Qi allows us to use Qi itself as a means of attack. These three stages are known by most, though only around one in a hundred people are actually able to use the last one.

"The fourth stage of Qi is something that only those that don't have an ability seem capable of learning. Most members of Pure have this, although there are also people who chose to focus on Qi rather than learn an ability. Although they exist, you won't be able to find too many, since abilities have just been more useful for finding jobs and such.

"Then there is the fifth stage of Qi. This is something that only members of Pure have reached. It allows them to insert Qi into an object, a person, or even a being, and give them a type of command."

Listening to the explanation, Quinn had actually come across all forms of Qi. He then went to hold Lucia's hand, and could tell now, that the Qi she was using to cover her brain was the second stage, not enhancing but forming a wall around the organ, and not for a second had she allowed it to lower around her brain. At first, she felt a little nervous, worried that 'Nate' was attempting something, but soon she realised that he was just checking out the Qi in her body.

"Is Qi something that's taught in school now? Everyone seems to know the second stage." Quinn asked.

"It has become a standard, yes, and even those that haven't learned it at school have chosen to learn it. I believe it was when attacks started to happen from the Red Vampires. It has scared everyone into learning it, and of course Pure was the best at teaching it. This was also one of the reasons how they managed to gain the people's favour."

"What about the Qi explosion? Is that the fifth stage of Qi that the Dhampirs are using, since they are working with Pure? Or is it something else." Quinn wanted to know.

"It's not really confirmed whether the Dhampires are working with Pure or not, but it wouldn't be surprising, seeing that their goals align." Lucia explained. "The Qi explosion is something not everyone knows, but I believe it's similar to how they activate the fourth stage of Qi. We don't really count it as a stage of Qi as there is only one way to use it."

If Quinn wanted to question his attackers, he would have to hold them still and remove the second stage from around the brain first. The problem was that they would surely use the Qi explosion, and without knowing how exactly it worked, there wasn't much he could do. He would have to act first to somehow disarm it, otherwise the person would be dead.

With no other questions on his mind, Quinn decided to let Lucia go, allowing her to get some rest. Heading back, Lucia couldn't help but be curious about who 'Nate' really was. However, she felt like it was rude to ask… or more like she was somehow afraid to ask.

She didn't believe he was just an Original Vampire to have Zinon gift him such an important piece of equipment. Upon opening the door, she could see that Jessica seemed to have been practising something.

She was partially sweating, which was strange for a vampire.

"Are you training?" Lucia asked.

"Yeah…i kind of stopped a little after leaving the unit, but after we were attacked the other day. It just-"

A sudden click was picked up by Jessica's ear, causing her to leap back a little. Lucia seeing this reaction also quickly pulled out her spear. The next second and the closet door was blasted off from where it was, and not just one, but three of the doors came unhinged and on the other side they could see something they hadn't expected.

"I thought it would be Dhampirs, but why…why are there battle robots here?!" Jesscia shouted. The robots were the same ones they had seen at the assessment, but they didn't have the same level of beast crystal they had at the assessment. These were higher.

'Why would they be here and why are they attacking us!' Lucia wondered, since the creator of the robots was none other than Logan Green.

*****

# Chapter 1597 - Pure Or Green
Seeing the battle robots from the Traveller centre in a place like this was surprising for the two girls. Because they were mainly used for two things, one was the example used earlier for the testing, and the other for fights and battles when in war and such. Right now since they weren't exactly in the Travel centre and ended up in their room, they were pretty sure they were here to hurt them.

The A.I robots were an improvement upon the manned Mechs that used to be used.

The mechs themselves needed crystals to power them, yet no matter what level of crystal was used, the power they could produce was the same. A higher tier crystal would only allow one to use the Mech for a more extended period.

However, they didn't need to be manned with the battle robots. They had their own advanced A.I. programming them, and the crystal inside them powered its whole body. A high tier crystal made their energy blasts stronger since they became faster. However, their bodies could not be improved on, but that didn't matter so much as they were made using a new strong material called Tingalt. One of the newly discovered materials of many in the vampire solar system and beast solar system.

With time, they were able to more thoroughly explore different planets and mine for different resources.

'They were hiding in our wardrobes, which means they had to be in there already.' Lucia thought, 'Were they hiding in there waiting for the next person to rent out this room? Or did they know about us and were coming after us? Then the question would be, why?'

The three robots immediately moved out in all directions, splitting up. They were also able to use the energy from the crystal embedded into them on their hands, producing small bursts of energy.

It gave them fast movement and flight.

'You're fast, but you're not as fast as lighting!' Lucia shouted out as she thrust her spear forward, striking one that was a little above them. The spear bashed into it, slapping it to the ceiling and leaving a black scorch mark.

Then, at the one coming close to her, she thrust her spear forward again, but the robot managed to dodge, and the next second, it threw out a fist, landing right in her face and sending her crashing into the wall.

"Lucia!'" Jessica shouted out once again. While she was dealing with two, the vampire was struggling with just the one in front of her. She had sent out several slashes of blood aura against the robot, but they were each met with energy blasts of equal power. Whatever crystal was inside these things, it was clear that it wasn't at the same level as the one at the training centre.

Seeing how the robot was coming closer towards them, Jessica had no choice but to use her string powers. At that moment, she wrapped it around the incoming punch of the robot. Stepping on the string, she moved the hand downward and then, with her own blood aura, she formed a sharp blade just outside of her fist. She then used blood hardening to make it a more solid form and punched right towards the robot's head with her whole strength.

She quickly punched it, and everyone heard a loud clang. A small hole had gone through it, but moving its head back, it looked like it was still active. After all, it was a robot, and hitting in the head wasn't an instant way to destroy it.

"Just die!" Jessica shouted in frustration, and she repeatedly hit it again and again. She then saw that the energy blast, on its other hand, was lighting up. Spinning around the back of the robot, she lifted it with her strings and slammed it into the ground.

She saw Lucia still fighting, peering at the latter's state. She had been hit a few times, but she used a substantial amount of Qi to protect herself. Rather than try to time when she would crash and then use Qi to protect herself, she had chosen to keep it active around her whole body. The only problem with this was one had had to have a large amount of Qi, or they would run out quickly.

"Two of them are tough! Can you take that one out quickly!" Lucia shouted as she finally managed to stab one of them, but it had hit the end of her spear just slightly, unfortunately avoiding the core in its chest and had hit its stomach, allowing the other one to blast her with energy once again.

Seeing that the one on the ground was about to blast her, Jessica had an idea. As it pointed its hand towards her, she quickly pulled on the strings and redirected the blast, so it hit one of the robots. It had successfully blasted the robot, chucking it off to the side, allowing them to each deal with one, at least for a short time.

"We're making a lot of noise right now. Shouldn't those other guys have heard us by now?" Jesica though.

——

In the room that was not too far from where there was, there was a reason why the trio had been unable to help, and that was because there were a couple of intruders in their rooms as well.

"I guess this is the reason why they took so long at the reception. They were busy preparing our rooms for us?" Quinn said.

The two men just grunted. Rather than robots, they were greeted by two men in strange dark-coloured clothing and beast armour.

"You're not dhampirs, I can tell, so tell me, what exactly are you guys?" Quinn asked.

However, none of them seemed to want to reply. They simply pulled out something which Quinn had only seen in history books.

"Peter! Protect Minny with your body at all costs!" Quinn shouted as soon as he identified the weapons in their hand.

The next second and Quinns fears were confirmed as the beast weapons started to fire off what seemed like bullets one after another; only, the bullets were auras of Qi. In quick succession, several shots were coming out, straight towards them.

Since it was unexpected for Quinn, he had no choice but to try and get rid of all the Qi himself. Shadow rose over his body as he used the Shadow Equip to put on the blue fang armour set he still had.

[Nitro accelerate activated]

The next second, he used the second stage of Qi to cover his hands, and he soon moved in front of all of the bullets coming from the intruders, blocking each and every one of them.

"Hey, are you seeing what he's doing right now? How is this possible?!" One of the men shouted.

"Just keep shooting!" The other replied.

Perhaps a vampire would have been able to avoid them with their speed, especially if it was just one gun, but this was two, and Quinn wasn't avoiding them, he was moving his hands in such a way that he could use his own Qi to move closer to the enemies and eventually, he began moving closer and closer.

Finally, reaching the guns, Quinn pulled them out from his hands and threw them behind him, onto the ground. He looked back for a second to see if he had caught them all, and whether Peter and Minny were safe. It was hard for him to tell if the bullets hitting Peter would have seriously affected him or not, and he didn't want to test it out right now.

'Those two girls and Zinon should have told me about Qi guns being a thing at this time.' Quinn was annoyed. In that instant, Quinn moved and grabbed onto the tow to try and get it so his Qi could get rid of the explosion before it occurred.

However, he had looked at the two men right in front of him at that moment. Something else was happening to the two bodies in front of him. Their bodies were starting to change; they were growing in size.

'What is this?' Quinn thought the energy he could sense was beast energy coming from them, and that's when he noticed an injection in both of their arms.

"We never thought we would have to use this for a mere vampire like you! But you left us with no choice!" The man shouted as he turned into a half-man, half-beast of some sort.

'These guys... They are turning into those creatures that Pure was creating…' Quinn noticed.

*****

# Chapter 1598 - Two Great Minds
After injecting the strange liquid, the two men's bodies started to change in front of the Celestial Vampire's group. The transformation was relatively quick, taking less than a second in total, yet with the Blue Fang armour set Quinn could have attacked them in the middle of their transformation, most likely killing them on the spot.

He was quite confident in that, despite their strange powers. However, that would rob him of an opportunity to learn the extent of his enemies powers. Someone had purposely sent these guys after them, whether it was linked to the first attack or not, that remained to be seen.

Whatever the case, the first lot they would send towards Quinn wouldn't be their strongest, not unless they had already figured out who he was, but judging from the Qi in their bodies he felt like it was unlikely.

While somewhat waiting for them to reply, Quinn took a glance at the guns.

'A lot really has changed compared to our time. In the past guns did nothing against the enemy, and with beast gear powers and abilities, a lot of powers had proven stronger than regular guns and more useful against beasts.

'Finding beast gear that could turn into a gun was rare, but even if that was the case, the main issue was the ammunition. Since regular bullets weren't too strong, one would have to find a crystal that could be used to turn into a beast bullet. The only story or person I ever heard of having such a thing was Oscar. Which he used to defeat the Demon tier beast.'

Regardless of all this, it was clear that the guns they were using weren't regular. It allowed them to fire their Qi into bullets similar to Quinn's Blood bullets. What he wanted to know was whether anyone could use such a thing, or if the third stage of Qi was a requirement for it.

The transformation of the two was finally complete. The men had grown to twice their initial size, their upper body gigantic, as thick as a large tree's trunk. Four horns stuck out of the top of their heads, and their eyes now resembled those of wild beasts. It was clear that they were no longer human.

———

Getting out from a chair, the short man pulled out all the cables from his body. He walked towards the edge of the white room that started to curve, and eventually the wall opened up. Exiting out of the place, it looked like he had left a giant circular ball, and now he was in some lab of sorts, with the giant ball in the middle of the room.

Then, the doors to the lab opened themselves, a particular individual with glasses entering.

"Do you always keep an eye on everything? It's frightening to imagine that you already knew I was coming." The man commented, wearing a large white overcoat. As he turned to look at some data, on his back, one could see that it had the number 4 stitched on.

"I hope you didn't wear that overcoat outside. If you are seen, it would cause great trouble."

"No worries, Mr Green, I was very careful." The man replied. "I assume you already know the reason for me coming here as well? Do you mind sharing the reason for you to take the initiative to send out not just high level A.I robots, but Pure agents? What's more, it appears as if you have given them your serum." Agent Four asked.

Yes, the young man, who had only grown a little larger, was indeed Logan Green, the current World Leader of Earth.

"I told you." Logan replied. "Creating the serum was not my merit, it was something that used to exist long ago. It had simply been erased from mankind's history. All I did was recreate that serum and improve upon it with the means of our time."

"We both should know those are just semantics." Agent Four let out a sigh. "You do realise that if someone sees them fighting in a public area or worse yet they end up defeated that the Vampire Corps won't be happy? Your action could result in a large confrontation."

It was then that Logan started off away from the agent, as if he was in deep thought about something. "You don't have to worry, they received injections from a Demi-god tier beast. It would be very surprising if something happened to them."

Quickly, Agent Four turned around from his computer in shock, staring at Logan with his mouth wide open in disbelief. "You did WHAT?! Why would you waste something so precious on a bunch of nobodies?!"

"Didn't you just state the reason for it yourself? I, too, would like to avoid any conflict with the vampires. However, if those vampires do manage to survive an attack from them, then it just means we have an even bigger problem on our hands." Logan stated.

———

The room was covered in blood from head to toe, both of Quinn's arms were drenched from his fingertips up a little above his elbow, and in front of him were the two evolved beasts.

When using his Inspect skill, Quinn had been told that those two had become something on the level of Demi-god tier beasts. At the same time, he noticed that unlike those he had seen during his time, these forms also seemed to enhance the level of Qi in their body.

With the amount of power they had, it was quite possible they could bring the whole hotel down. Not only would that have brought attention to them, but it would have caused others to lose their lives.

Quinn was sick of people dying, but what he really didn't want to happen was people dying because of him. Without hesitating, he slashed his hand across one of the member's arms. Following his hand, a red crescent could be seen in the air. It wasn't quite a Blood swipe, nor was it Blood hardening, but it was something in between.

It was one of Quinn's new blood skills he had learned. Blood Slash. It was a stronger form of the blood Swipe. Rather than a claw of red aura, this was more of a permanent form that would be used in a single line.

It was sharp, similar to the crescent kick but more powerful as it had condensed blood aura. There were what would be considered downsides to the move. The range was only what would leave one's fingertips, and at the same time the slash would only be as strong as one's aura, but for Quinn that wasn't a problem.

The arm fell to the floor and blood spewed onto the ground. The next second, though, and the arm had regrown right where it had come off. It was a speed and a large limb which looked more impressive than even Peter's healing.

"Haha you can't kill us, do you even know what we-"

Before the two monsters could finish their sentence, Quinn continued to use the Blood slash with the remaining time of his Blue Fang set. With every cut, blood would spray from their bodies and hit the back wall. Quinn continued to do this, until both of them were no more, their bodies just slices of flesh on the floor.

'I wanted to ask them questions, but with the amount of Qi they had, if they had done a Qi explosion, then we would have been in serious trouble.'

When turning around, he could see that Peter had covered Minny's eyes, shielding her from the gruesome sight. A surprising act by him, but it showed he at least understood emotions, even though he himself seemed unfazed by it.

"You think they were after us?" Peter asked.

"I don't see why else they would have been here." Quinn replied. "We should see if there are others that have been sent towards the girls room, and besides we will find out if that attack was meant for us or not. They can take this as a message, since their people won't come back alive, they'll probably soon send more after us. It just makes our job easier."

# Chapter 1599 - Eyes Everywhere
After finishing up the short battle, Quinn thought that if the girls had an assailant, he could perhaps use the latter for information instead, as long as they weren't carrying the same type of serum, of course.

However, using his ears, he could hear nothing. There was no fighting sound, and he wondered if that was worse. Peter now had Minny over his shoulders; she held tight on top of his head as the two men ran towards the other room.

"Wee...! This is so fun!" Minny shouted, tapping Peter's head like a tambourine. Although it would annoy most, it seemed to do nothing for Peter.

When the two finally arrived, they now understood why there was no sound coming from their room. It was because the fight was over. Once again, Lucia seemed quite injured; her arm was somewhat broken. There were long scratches all over but no serious wounds other than her broken arm.

Then there was Jessica herself. She was standing in the centre of the room. The three A.I. robots that had attacked them were long destroyed by large lashes on their body parts all over.

"Were there any others?" Peter asked.

Lucia, holding her arm, looked towards Jessica for a second. The latter's eyes seemed somewhat lost as she stared into space, not even noticing those that had entered.

'What she just did…is that why she left the Vampire Corps? It would make sense, but then why is she with us? I guess I shouldn't be one to judge someone else's situation.'

"The three robots were the only ones that attacked us. Were you guys attacked as well?" Lucia replied.

Although they weren't injured, Quinn had blood over his body, which suggested at least something had to have happened, and now she understood why they couldn't help.

While Peter explained what exactly happened, Quinn decided to walk forward, heading towards the robots. He used his inspect skill, hoping it wasn't true, but that's when he could see it, the same name had appeared. Those robots were created by Logan Green.

'Why would Pure and Logan's robots be with each other?' Quinn thought. 'Is it like Zinon warned me about? On the surface, they are against each other, but secretly they are working together, but then why the attack? Was it the name I used?

'If it is really Logan, then he might have noticed something. And if we're up against Logan Green, he'll be able to find us anywhere, and it makes sense how he knew about us. This is getting dangerous, and maybe I should reconsider the idea of bringing the girls around. I thought the dhampirs were after them but what if the enemy is actually after me?' Quinn started to think.

"You girls did well, the A.I. robots; they had king-tier crystals. You definitely would have passed that Travellers exam with flying colours." As he pulled the crystal from the core of the robot's body, Quinn said and threw them towards the two girls.

"It's your reward after all, and I think it's not safe to stay here any longer. Jessica, if we head to the Vampire Corps, do you think they could protect the two of you?" Quinn asked.

When hearing her name, Jessica had finally snapped out of it, noticing the 'Original Vampire' and the White were in the room.

"Right, yes, if anything, the Vampire Corps are loyal and will do anything to protect fellow vampires. But what do you mean by 'protect the two of you'? Are you planning on leaving us after we agreed to come with you?" Jessica asked.

"I'll be honest," Quinn said. "I think the attack was because of us. I know that sounded illogical, but once we arrive at the Vampire Corps and I feel you girls are safe, let us part ways."

Jessica felt somewhat miserable about this. Her grand journey with a vampire original was rather giving her a spark, a purpose, and being of use, but now once again, she would be tossed to the side, not beneficial for them as well.

Gathering their things, the small group was off, leaving the hotel once again, although heading out through the front door wasn't the best idea, so Quinn had another suggestion as he activated his beast armour. Grabbing onto the two girls, allowing Peter and Minny to hold onto his wings.

The group kicked the glass window, breaking out and holding on as tight as possible. He flew down to the surface, now deciding to travel in the night searching for the Vampire Corps.

"Actually, now that I think about it, why don't I just fly us there," Quinn suggested, as he was already bending his knees getting ready for another takeoff. Flying was something he hadn't experienced before apart from using his shadow wings once.

It was surprising how easy it was to use. Honestly, Quinn was a little worried that they might have just gone down and splat right onto the ground. Of course, he wouldn't mention that to any of them, but flying turned out to be easier compared to the many other things he had to learn in the past.

"Wait, the Vampire Corps base is far, and I'm not sure Lucia can take it anymore," Jessica claimed.

Just from the short flight down, her face was already turning green, and any second, it looked like she might hurl up and vomit whatever she had eaten that day.

"Don't worry; it won't be a sudden drop. It will be a lot smoother." Quinn claimed, and already the whole group was off in the distance.

———

As soon as the group had destroyed the A.I. robots, a certain individual was, of course, informed about it. The only thing Logan was wondering was whether to be surprised or not.

"It looks like the other two aren't answering either," Logan calmed down as he pulled up the image received from a camera in the hotel. He looked at all of them closely, wondering if he recognized any of them.

However, they were all using faces that one couldn't recall, nor did he recognize.

"So what are you going to do now? Send an army after these vampires, so they don't start spreading rumours?" Agent four suggested. "And you were worried about me when this issue might be caused by you."

Logan glanced at the agent, and the next second he placed his hand on the terminal.

"We still have yet to know the extent of their strength. I was hoping the fighting would continue in the hallways. But now, we don't even know if those two were able to use the serums or not yet until we recover the bodies. However, I do agree, sending in more people would just cause more problems, and it would be a waste of resources."

"Yes, and real lives of people, not just those of your stupid robot. If you want to, send the whole force of A.I. to go after him."

"No," Logan replied. "That would be too obvious. There are ways to see what type of people we're dealing with; for instance, we can use the public to be our eyes."

Activating his ability, he soon got to work. There were several travelling centres on Mars. After all, they tried their best to operate like other cities even with everything going on. This also meant there were plenty of Travellers groups factions and those of high ranking.

What they didn't expect was for them in the middle of the night to suddenly get a request. A unique quest had been received, not just on Mars but also on the other planets in Earth's solar system.

"Hey, did you see!" One of the Travellers said.

"You mean about the vampires?" Another replied.

"They have to be strong to have that placed on them; it might mean they are in the Vampire Corps territory as well, so it's pointless."

"Pointless? How could you say that? This is the biggest bounty that has been put on a group of people ever before!" The man shouted as he pointed his arm out to the digital board.

Here, there were the faces of Quinn and Peter's disguised version and the two other girls. With far too many zeros for them to count. Without a doubt, if anyone saw them, they would attempt to bring them in, because they had just received the world's biggest bounty.
