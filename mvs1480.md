# Chapter 1480 - Lightning Qi
It was a solution that Quinn thought only Leo could come up with. During his time in school, Quinn had taught Qi to many, and Leo would be using a similar method to what he had done to guide others.

In the first place, Quinn just took what he had learned from Leo and applied it to others and a little bit from Chris as well.

But there was one problem. When Quinn used to teach Qi to those at school, even for the geniuses, it would take them some time, and right now, they lacked time the most.

There was no way they could wait a few days for it to click in Owen's head, nor was he sure they could all even stay here that long.

'Can Leo teach him how to use Qi so fast and at this moment?' Quinn considered.

First, though, Owen would have to accept learning it in the first place.

"Qi… I believe it's a strange power that you explained which is naturally present in our bodies and is also the reason behind my selection to be part of this group. It is also the same strange power that Pure used too, correct?" Owen asked.

They had all seen the power of Qi being displayed a number of times, and there was a great number of those in the Cursed faction that already knew how to use it.

They just had never made it public due to the misunderstanding it might cause. At the time, the Cursed faction wasn't in the best light, and people would have forced connections to the Cursed faction and Pure.

Leo nodded to the question.

"You have the talent to learn it well. Of course, just like everything, it will take time for you to master it, but it will increase your strength greatly while not affecting any of your current powers. However, I will only be able to guide you a little at this moment; the rest will be up to you."

There was one person who was somewhat sulking upon hearing this. Leo had offered to help Owen yet hadn't offered to help Abdul. The latter felt like it was unfair.

"Owen is our last hope now," Sunny said as she could read the expression on his face. "We wanted this to be fair competition, and truthfully, we thought that all of you were qualified, but at the end of the day, the king is the one to decide.

"If that is the case, now with only one person left, we have to try our best to make him succeed."

Understanding the explanation, Abdul just crossed his arms and was just happy that the others didn't get help, even though he was unaware that the other two had also used Qi.

Owen agreed and sat down on the ground with Leo standing behind him. The latter was getting ready to place his hands on his shoulders. Seeing this, Quinn was a little afraid because Leo had attempted to teach Qi to Quinn, and that was how he was turned and was worried that the same thing could happen to Owen at this moment.

However, Quinn had taught others Qi without turning them, using Leo's same method now. Since Leo was better at controlling Qi, even more so than him, Quinn had to trust him.

With his ability, Leo was more in tune with the energy that was actually following inside of Owen. He could describe to him in great detail what was happening. He could also adjust and tell if the other person was doing something wrong because, as silly as it may sound, Leo could see what the other person was doing.

Whereas when Quinn would do this, he had no choice but to guess what the other was doing. Time slowly passed, and about fifteen minutes later, it seemed like Leo was finally done with his job.

Stepping away and walking off to the side, Leo stood not too far from Owen.

It felt surreal, Quinn wasn't sure if Owen really could activate Qi at this moment, but if he had another breakthrough similar to what Samantha had, perhaps he could do it.

That's when Quinn noticed something. Leo looked quite exhausted and was staring in Layla's direction.

'Have these guys…planned something?' Quinn narrowed his eyes.

Standing back just like Layla, Owen moved away. Although she had failed, Layla knew that this was important to them all. Seeing how sturdy the shell was, they needed this king on their side.

With her ability, she was now doing something unique to her and was slowly transferring her own Qi energy into him, and at the same time, Leo had activated his soul weapon.

Owen had learned a lot; he was a fast learner, which surprised even Leo. They didn't call him the genius of the Graylash family for no reason. Still, it wasn't enough time for him to learn how to use it properly. So with his soul weapon, he would help draw that aura and the energy within Owen out of him into his fist.

While standing in the centre of the room, Owen activated his lightning powers but only around his legs. It spiralled blue sparks from his foot up to his knees, as he then stood in a sprinting position as if he was ready to set off at any second.

It was showy, but there was a reason for it. He could tell that this energy within his body wasn't his own, and Owen hoped that they also gave power to his legs. After all, speed was an important factor when making one's punch as strong as possible.

He threw down his usual metal fan into the ground, rendering it to stick upright, and then focused on his right hand, which now seemed to be covered in blue light; unlike his legs, this seemed steady. It was practically glowing so much that the hand seemed to be made of pure light.

"Go!" Owen shouted.

He ran forward, a deep scorch mark left behind by his feet, with every step. Then after a couple of steps, bending his knees, he jumped up in the air and started to spin his body. It was one of his most classic moves but adjusted a little for the test as he held out one of his hands.

Spinning in the air, Owen's body shot out like a lightning bolt and crashed headfirst into the shell with his fist firmly planted on it. His body was upright as it hit the shell, and the two forces collided.

The purple sparks that would usually come from the shell when the others would use Qi went off once again, and this time, they were more fierce than ever before, as if they were trying to attack the person in front of it.

"You shouldn't have let me go last. I know about this already." Owen said.

As the purple sparks flew up at Owen's arms, Layla became worried. They couldn't affect Samantha that much because her attack wasn't too strong, but if Layla hadn't used the second stage of Qi to protect her arm, she could only imagine what the purple sparks could do.

Before it could reach Owen's arm, though, his own blue lightning sparks from his glowing arms would attack whatever went close. It looked like a battle between two lightning powers, blue and purple.

As they hit each other, they were getting wilder and wilder, but both Layla and Leo continued to use their powers before the two of them had fallen to their knees. They had done all they could, and now they needed to rest.

Fortunately, Genbu was so mesmerised by the scene that he failed to see both of them falling to the ground. Otherwise, for sure, he would have noticed that something was strange.

Finally, the purple sparks slowly disappeared, and only the blue ones remained.

A shockwave was sent into the mountain from behind, and Owen fell to the ground, now on one knee, his knuckles no longer were on the shell. The sleeve covering his arm had burnt into nothingness, but he didn't care and looked up to see the result.

*****

# Chapter 1481 - Unbreakable Shell
Everyone could tell that the attempt made by Owen was the best attempt out of all of them so far, whether it was because of the help he received from the others, the small training he had done with Leo, or the fact that Owen had actually tried, it was hard to tell, but they were waiting to see the result in anticipation.

If Owen hadn't succeeded in impressing the turtle, then they would have to quickly come up with another way to convince the king, maybe even fight and force him to form a contract with one of them.

With all of them there, they thought it would be an easy thing to do. The only problem was how the other familiar would feel about this.

From the outside, the effect of Owen's punch wasn't entirely obvious; for one, the shell was still in one piece. Perhaps it would crack soon after, but it never did, which proved just how strong the shell was. When Owen's arm fell, some of them were able to see. Once again, Genbu started to move, and he scuffled across the ground quickly in excitement.

His large head blocked the view of the shell from the others.

"My word, I must say, you…you actually…you actually managed to damage it!"

He certainly sounded pleased with the result, but the others were still amazed. It was clear the words that Genbu had spoken; he claimed that the shell had been damaged but not destroyed.

When moving his head out of the way, the others could see that a single scale on the shell, where Owen had put all his strength, had been cracked. However, the crack itself didn't ripple out to the adjacent scales, and even the base of the shell was mostly intact.

Genbu even turned the shell around, and the crack hadn't gone to the other half on the back either.

"I hope this is enough." Sunny mumbled quietly under her breath. Even the other two kings that were present weren't so sure, and they were ready to help all the others if need be to subdue Genbu.

Genbu's face was straight, showing no emotion, unlike his voice earlier, and he had his eyes closed.

"This one is talented…this one is very talented. If he can destroy one of my shells to this degree, then without a doubt, I feel he can hurt almost anyone out there. If one with the strongest defence teams up with one with the strongest attack, then the two will make a powerful combo. Far more powerful than any of the other kings." Genbu smiled.

"Does this mean you are willing to form a contract?" Sunny asked hesitantly.

To this, Genbu nodded, and the others inwardly cheered without giving too much away. They had succeeded in their task, and one more familiar, an extremely useful one, would be a part of the team.

Abdul, Layla, and even Samantha were honestly a little disheartened that they could not get the familiar. Each of them had their reasons for wanting the king on their side. Especially after witnessing how strong its outer shell was, they wanted it more, and if they were truthful, they felt like the person that needed it least was Owen.

He was already more powerful than them all, but in the end, this was what happened; those who were strong would get even stronger.

Genbu had come to Owen and was now looking him up and down. The turtle couldn't stop complimenting him about his body and features, and his attitude towards Owen had taken a full one-eighty degree turn.

Meanwhile, Quinn stood near Layla, "You did a good job, Layla."

"I honestly believe that you had the best chance out of all of them, and you actually would have produced the best result as well. However, you are selfless. Honestly, I don't think the others would have done what you did.

"I know you gave some of your power to help out Owen, and you thought about the benefit of all of us rather than your own. Who knows, the turtle might have been bluffing it and would have just contracted that with the best result, and I think you knew this as well before making your decision."

Quinn was right. Layla had thought about that before helping out Owen, but the truth was she wasn't the selfless one; she actually didn't wish to help. Leo was the one that had approached her in the end. She knew Quinn was just trying to cheer her up, but now, how could she tell him the truth?

While Quinn was talking to her, the contract process began on the other side. As Genbu pressed his head against Owen's, he shrunk in size by a little and was now at the same height as Owen.

Frankly, it seemed like Owen was being quite respectful to the turtle. Perhaps after discovering how hard its shell was, he realised how much value a familiar had. After a few moments passed, Genbu started to turn into a strong purple mist and then zapping itself like a large particle of energy, a purple lightning bolt appeared on the palm of Owen's hand.

The turtle had disappeared, and it looked like the contract was a success. Soon though, the lighting bolt lit up, and Genbu was back in front of everyone.

"How do you like the symbol? Your lightning powers from before inspired me." Genbu stated. "The contract is completed. Unlike others, I only have one desire: to look after all of those in my territory. I wish to protect them and feed them with energy, so you need to stay alive as long as you can."

"I don't plan on dying so soon, and I wish that you can help me stay alive," Owen asked as well.

The group was soon ready to leave the mountain. They couldn't stay here too much longer and needed to head back to the exact location where they had first entered so the Boneclaw could take them back to their world.

Now that there was no war going on, Dunluck could call upon his allies and allow them a quick return. Still, before leaving, Quinn couldn't help but look at one of the many shells that were still left in great shape by the others since no one had touched them.

"Once a contract has been formed, there's no way to cancel a contract, right? Not unless you kill the host?" Quinn asked, walking up to one of the shells.

"Correct," Genbu said, nodding his head.

"Well, if that's the case," Quinn replied as he readied himself.

He stood there in front of one of the intact turtle shells and readied his fist. The Qi soon collected in front of him. The shadow rose and switched from his blood king armour set to the Blue fang.

[Nitro accelerate activated]

Qi of the second stage slowly wrapped around his hand, and he was so close to the shell that sparks were flying from it before he had even touched it.

Seeing this, Sunny couldn't help but giggle.

"I guess those comments got to you more than we thought."

Blood aura started to form around Quinn's hand, and with his blood control, he spun it as fast as possible. Ready, Quinn then ran back to the centre of the room. He was so fast that the others had only blinked, and he was in the centre.

Then running back, the ground beneath his feet formed a crater as he jumped up, and he threw the blood drill, infused with Qi into the shell with the power of his Nitro accelerated speed.

The purple sparks couldn't do anything as the attack slammed into the shell, cracking it instantly. The powers didn't collide like the others. The shell was smashed to pieces, with it flying everywhere, and the momentum of the attack continued as it hit the mountain wall behind it.

The whole room shook until the energy finally disappeared, and once everything calmed down, they saw Quinn standing, with no shell left in front of him.

"Ahh, now that was satisfying," Quinn said, turning around and smiling at the others.

*****

# Chapter 1482 - The Reason You Were Picked
While walking back to the others, Quinn's steps suddenly came to a halt and turned around, only to see a giant cavity in the side of the mountain. He didn't know what had come over him at that moment.

Maybe, it was the fact that he wanted to test out his strength, or this was a challenge that no one seemed to pass, and he wanted to accomplish. Perhaps it was the turtle's bickering, but being able to destroy a shell like that felt extremely satisfying. However, he realised that it had come at the cost of hurting the world, and now he felt quite bad that he let these strange emotions get the better of him.

"I'm sorry, if I can give some of my energy to help restore this world, I'll fix the mountain," Quinn said, rubbing the back of his head out of embarrassment.

None of them replied because they all stood still with their mouths open at what they had just seen. The shell was, without a doubt, very tough. None of them could deny that, so how on earth did Quinn manage to break it?

"Bhahahaha." Owen let out a hollow laugh, "After all our hard work just damaging one scale, you go and do that. You really are one of a kind."

The cat looked furious, Quinn never thought he had seen a vein on a cat before, but it seemed like it was possible because there was one bulging through the side of the cat head beyond the fur, which honestly had Quinn quite worried.

"I'll speak to Bony or something about it. I'm sorry." Quinn said once again.

Although most had gotten over the initial shock, there was one among them who still had his jaw left wide open, literally.

The turtle Genbu still couldn't believe it even after Sunny walked towards him and waved her hand in front of its face.

Eventually, though, as Quinn got closer, the turtle snapped out of it, slamming its mouth shut.

"You tricked me! You all tricked me! This little bug wasn't weak at all. He had great strength, why would you, and how…how? No one has ever broken my shell!"

"I deeply apologise." Sunny immediately said, seeing how the situation could perhaps get rough, and at the end of the day, she had to cover for her king. "You see, he is a little special. He is not just any vampire but the king of vampires, which is why he has great strength.

"We were afraid that if you saw his strength, you might wish to find someone that would match up to him, but you should know that your shell is one of the strongest things in existence, and there could rarely be anyone who could match up to its sturdiness."

"Apart from someone like him," Genbu complained and was staring at Quinn with his intense eyes. Thinking about it more, Genbu knew the real strength of his shell. In the first place, he actually hadn't expected even one of them to activate the purple sparks, and if he was honest, even the first human, the girl, who had taken this test, had passed in his eyes.

He had greatly underestimated them all, which was why he had decided to change his tune after the first one to take the test.

"I have already signed a contract, I can't go back, but I just don't like how you made me a fool," Genbu said, walking away. He started to remember all the times he called Quinn weak, and recalling those words, he couldn't help but his feet stomp the ground in embarrassment.

The group soon moved. The mountain began to repair itself as they made their way out from it. The group found it strange; it was as if the familiars themselves were in control of when they would use energy to repair the world, or perhaps the world was aware of what was going on and decided to act once they were done.

Either way, the group waited for the horses to enter the area, which didn't take long. This time there were enough for everyone, allowing for each of them to ride their individual horse as they made their way back.

Genbu, who could change its size, had become so small that he could be easily held in Owen's palm and decided to stay on top of his contractor's head, similar to how Ovin would sit on Leo's head.

"I'm not used to being in that space, and I prefer the outdoors, so keep me out for as long as possible. Although I will need to rest from time to time." Genbu claimed.

While riding, Quinn noticed that he was getting looks from a few people. Genbu, for one, still seemed to be upset over the whole thing. Then there was Abdul as well.

'That strength… he didn't display that in the game. Wait, didn't they say something like he wasn't the one who fought? He was that strange dragon-looking thing, right? But even then, his strength is far beyond what I suspected.

'I wonder if he and Sera fought with their full strength, who would win.' Abdul thought.

"I still can't believe it," Genbu repeated as they continued to go through the land. "Even if I can't sense energy, I can't believe you people tricked me just like that. Hey kid, your familiar is the Undead king, correct? He certainly picked a good one."

For some reason, upon hearing the turtle's words, Quinn felt like he needed to correct the turtle.

"Although the Undead king picked me, I didn't have this strength when we made the contract, and I was actually weaker than anyone here at the time. I still don't understand why he picked me."

"The Undead king, I have known him for a while, a lot longer than the other two," Genbu replied. "He had been in this land for a long-time, and just like myself, he was someone who never left or formed a contract with anyone.

"He took his duty in culling those familiars more seriously than anyone, and if there were any disputes between those in his area, he would be the first one to solve it, which is why I was more surprised than anyone to learn when he had contracted someone. However, there was a rumour that he hadn't returned even though his contract had broken.

"Honestly, it's been a long time since he and I have spoken to each other. I would also like to know how he made up his mind to contract, which person he contracted with and why. All familiars have a desire, a craving, and it's similar to a life goal, which words can't explain so well.

"Perhaps it's something similar to humans believing they have a purpose. Energy is just what we need to live and for our world to continue, but the desire is something else. What I am trying to say is, that you must have something that is fulfilling his desire, or at least he thought you would satisfy it somewhat."

It was a question that had been on Quinn's mind since he had been here, and it would have been a lot easier if the Boneclaw would just answer him.

…

Eventually, the group returned to the spot, and the whole mission was a success. Layla and Leo were the most exhausted from this adventure, and it looked like they might need a couple of days rest before they returned to action.

To their surprise, the Boneclaw was already waiting for them in the exact spot. For how long, who knew.

After getting off the horses and saying goodbye, Quinn first walked up to the Boneclaw and looked up to him.

"I guess you did what you needed to do?" Quinn asked, to which the Boneclaw just nodded. At least it looked like he nodded. Quinn was hoping that the Boneclaw would tell him what he had done, but his familiar hadn't been open to him for this long, and it looked like it would take some more time before he relaxed himself a bit more.

When Genbu and Boneclaw looked at each other, the two of them didn't say anything. It looked like Genbu wanted to say some words, but in the end, he just smiled, and everyone continued on their way. The teleporter opened, and the group found themselves back in the room they had left before.

"Everyone is here, right; no one is missing?" Quinn asked.

Everyone answered, and the Boneclaw disappeared, forming a simple mark on Quinn's back. Ovin did the same along with the horse, while the only one that chose to remain outside was Genbu. He had never seen what the actual human world looked like and was quite curious.

"Quinn," Chucky called, standing in front of them, leaning up against the wall, and it looked like he had been waiting for the group for a while now. "You weren't gone as long as I thought you would be; well, Sam would be glad to hear that.

"I have some news for you. The vampire soldiers, along with Ashley, have arrived, but before you greet them, Sam told me to tell you, Hayley is with them, and she wishes to speak to you."

It was a conversation that Quinn wasn't looking forward to, and behind him was another female who wanted to talk to him as well.

*****

# Chapter 1483 - A Request Of Tears
After everyone's return, they felt a lot better. Rather than their energy being sapped away from them, now they could feel it slowly returning. Only now did they truly feel how much effect the world was having on them.

In the same way, it was the opposite for the familiars, and Genbu understood why the other familiars decided not to stay out for so long.

Quinn told everyone that he would call and meet up with everyone later. First, they should all get some rest, and he knew they needed it, though there were a few who were worried about Owen.

In fact, for the first time, even Owen looked to be a bit tired. Before leaving for the rooms, he first went towards Leo.

"I wanted to ask, the power that you taught me earlier. I don't want to pry, but if possible, can I teach it to those in the Graylash family?" Owen asked. "I feel like I was a bit foolish in the past, wishing for everyone to learn the lighting power thinking it was the strongest, and although I still somewhat believe that, and it would solve the inequality problem, it wouldn't solve it completely.

"It is impossible to have everyone on equal footing, but before even thinking about that, we need to win this war, so we need all the power we can get. However, I assume that this power of Qi is something similar to an Original ability. If you do not wish for me to pass this on, I will respect your decisions."

Knowing that Quinn would have overheard everything, Leo looked over. Yet, it felt strange for him to do something like that. Qi was never something Quinn thought was his own to teach others, and he always felt like it belonged to Leo.

However, Quinn did agree with what Owen said about its power, which was also why many in the Cursed faction were learning it.

"You may pass on what you know, but unfortunately, I don't have the time to teach you," Leo replied.

"I'll send someone," Quinn said after hearing that answer. "A few people in the Cursed faction know how to use Qi. I'll send someone to join the Graylash faction and teach it. You're right that you guys need to get stronger."

There was another reason why Quinn was holding back teaching it to the other groups, and that was because Qi was somewhat a weakness for vampires. Especially now that Quinn was king, he also needed to look out for the vampires.

However, if they didn't win this war, what vampires would he have to look after. No matter what, they needed to use everything at their disposal to get rid of the threat.

After almost all had left, one person had stayed behind, and that was Samantha. Quinn had even asked for Oscar to leave and head back and find Mona for the time being. It seemed like Oscar was having difficulty deciding, but he eventually listened to Quinn.

"I know you have a lot of questions, so let me explain first how I found Oscar…" Quinn spoke softly as he went into detail. He told her about the vampire who was related to him, Richard Eno, a great scientist for the vampires and the same person they all knew as a great scientist for the humans.

He then explained how they had found Oscar at one of Eno's labs and just that. There was no need for Samantha to know about the trials, only how they found Oscar. However, the bit that was difficult for Quinn to speak about was Oscar himself.

How, if asking him if he remembered certain details, he didn't. Honestly, Quinn always thought of him as a different Oscar until the he had met Samantha. It was clear he knew who Samantha was, even if he didn't know about himself.

As Quinn finished his story, tears streamed down Samantha's face. She gripped her cheeks so tightly that the tip of her nails dug deep. Quinn had seen such reactions before. He knew this wasn't just sadness and anger; there was also much regret.

"The one you told me about…the Richard Eno, he came to me saying that he could bring him back, but he warned me…he warned me that father be different from how he was before if he came back…honestly, I don't know if it would have been better if he had completely forgotten me, but the fact that he remembers me…"

Samantha gripped her clothing around her chest, over her heart, pulling the fabric tightly.

"It just hurts even more…Quinn… I want to be stronger…I can't live like this…can you help me? Can you contact Richard for me? He made Oscar like this with only his head, so maybe with me-"

"He's dead." Quinn interrupted her. "That's why we went to his lab in the first place."

Hearing this, Samantha's lost the little hope she just felt. Although Quinn wasn't so sure if Eno was dead, and even if he was, most of the knowledge and information about Oscar was stored in Logan's head, but he didn't want her to continue searching for questions that would most likely never be answered.

Quinn had already asked Logan if there was a way to turn Oscar back, and Logan had answered it wasn't possible.

"I still need to get stronger. I'm not stupid. I know that if I beat One Horn, this feeling won't go away, but I have to do something for him. I have to help. When everyone fought and protected me, I was knocked out by some stupid sleeping gas. I couldn't even destroy a damn turtle's shell! So tell me, how the hell can I defeat One Horn like this?!" Samantha cried out.

"That's why, Quinn, you're the vampire king, right? Which means you can turn people. So turn me! Whatever you want, my blood or anything… just take it! but please turn me, and help me get stronger!" Samantha screamed as she dug her nails deeper in her palm, making blood drip from her hand over the table.

Quinn looked at it dripping from her hand and falling down. He then licked his finger and wiped it against the cut she had just made, and slowly it started to heal.

"Pretty neat, right?" Quinn said. "Our Sylvia can heal small wounds like this, but usually it wouldn't work this quick; that's only because of who I am. Just becoming a vampire wouldn't solve all your problems, and it doesn't work like that.

"Being a vampire comes with difficulties, a life where perhaps everyone who ever knew you and knows you will hate you. People will look at you differently, treat you differently, and most probably, you will have to hide your identity. I'm not saying no to you, but it's not an answer to your problems, and it's not a magic shortcut to gain great power. You will lose your ability, and you might be drawn to blood like this."

"You turned Sach into one, right?" Samantha said. "I know… I know…and I know about your past, Quinn. Oscar told me to find more about you once, everything about you. You had no ability, you were weak, the bottom of your class in every way possible, and you had no potential at all.

"Your whole life changed because you became a vampire. So don't give me that crap! Look at where you are? Just help me… please…" Samantha pleaded.

"You don't know what I've been through!" Quinn frowned, which caused Samantha to startle a little, but he took a deep breath and spoke again. "You don't know what I've been through," Quinn repeated, this time in a softer tone. "But you're right; if you're this insistent, then I will help you."

Quinn said as he bit his thumb. He lifted the blood in the air and dangled it just above her head using his powers.

"This is your last chance. Do you wish to be turned? There is a chance that you might turn into something that will force me to kill you?" Quinn asked for the last time.

Samantha nodded and opened her mouth as if she knew the next step. The blood then swooped from above and fell right into Samantha's mouth.

[The blood ritual has been activated.]

# Chapter 1484 - She Turned Into A What?
It had been a while since Quinn had turned someone, and he could never get used to this feeling because each time he did turn someone, there was a chance that they might turn into a dangerous subclass that needed to be eliminated on the spot.

It hadn't happened too often, but after becoming king, Quinn had seen all the different subclasses that the vampires kept for combat. There were far more possibilities than he imagined, and later, he had learned that the vampires had a way to influence changes towards one of these subclasses.

It looked like they had found some detailed research from the second family. Cindy had been doing countless experiments, and even with her powers, she was able to reverse a human after the latter had been turned.

She would do this again and again until reaching the result they wanted. In the second family, only she had such a strong ability. Bryce had extracted this information from the second family but had not shared it with the others.

On the side, he had been creating a vampire subclass army, mainly for war. Quinn had looked over these methods but never went into too many details.

Firstly, some of the details on how to make certain subclasses were unethical, and he could never imagine forcing a human to go through that to be turned into practically a monster. The second reason was that none of these methods had explained about turning them into other subclasses.

Quinn had his theories, but that's all they were, a bunch of theories.

"An undead is unlikely, right, but according to Vincent, anything is possible. Perhaps the circumstance for the turning could influence the result, but it was never a 100 percent guarantee, just an increase in chance."

This was why Quinn was surprised when the result had finally appeared. Samantha's transformation had gone better than most of whom Quinn had turned.

She seemed to be going through great pain but somehow held back her screams. She just sat there at her seat in the canteen instead of rolling around the floor in pain.

She was a strong person, and if she unlocked the power of Qi that was within her, she would be a great asset.

[You have successfully created a Draugr.]

'Another one? The only other Draugr I know at the moment is Linda, right?' As Quinn thought about this, he realised one thing, there was one person that might not be so happy about the change he had made, and that was Fex.

'I probably should have asked him before I did this…but I mean, it was Samantha's decision to be changed, right? And he shouldn't have the same problem that Layla and I have.' Quinn thought.

Samantha looked to be adjusting to herself, it was a strange experience, and she had a lot to learn. Quinn explained her transformation briefly and told her to see Linda understand her situation in detail. She would show her the ropes for now as there were still many other things that Quinn needed to focus on.

For one, there was another female waiting for him and most likely not for a pleasant chat.

'I better just get all these conversations out of the way.' Quinn thought as he headed to the Cursed faction members' quarters.

Everyone seemed to be in one of the large reception rooms or the converted training room they had created. Hearing about Quinn's return, a few people were waiting for him, and one of them was Hayley.

When Quinn entered the reception room, which had a bar with sofas and tables arranged all around, he saw Sam and Hayley sitting at one of the tables. As soon as Hayley noticed Quinn, she shot up like a bamboo shoot and stared at him.

'Don't make this more difficult than it already is.' Quinn frowned inwardly.

Upon approaching the sofa, rather than having Sam speak, he simply instructed everyone to start preparing the vampire soldiers to head off with Sera. Now that the group had come back from the familiar world, they were just wasting time staying here now. He promised he would speak to Ashley and the others before they left.

Everyone in the room became busy as Quinn took a seat opposite Hayley, with the latter drinking a cup of coffee.

'At least she looks calm.'

"Please, I already heard from Sam that my father has passed, but he wasn't there at the moment. I was hoping you could tell me all his last moments. What happened to him… why did he change after meeting you. I want you to tell me everything." Hayley requested.

'First Samantha and now Hayley.' Quinn inwardly sighed, but it was better to get done with these conversations; delaying it anymore would not do any good.

Quinn told Hayley the whole truth about how Paul and his men were the ones who discovered the vampire world. It was because of this that they were kept captive. It all happened before Quinn was king, so they needed to strike a deal.

Quinn was the one that had turned Paul, and the rest of his men, to save their lives, but when explaining, Quinn didn't make it sound like a good deed, and Hayley could tell how hard it was for him to say this. It was clear he wasn't proud of his actions.

Then he explained the rest, that Paul was a good person, and he had gone to look out for someone named Kazz. When talking about it, Quinn felt like he should have realised their close relationship sooner; it was almost as if he saw Kazz as a replacement for someone. Quinn didn't convert his thoughts into words and just explained how he saw it and let Hayley decide what was going on.

"In the end, he risked his life for this Kazz girl, huh, and she even still ended up dying? So there's nothing left of him, not even the person she protected because he is dead as well?" Hayley said as she sat back and let it all in. In the end, Hayley just started to laugh.

It wasn't the reaction Quinn was expecting at all from her, but soon that laughter turned into a single tear that ran down her cheek.

"That idiot," Hayley said as she smiled. "I have a favour to ask. I missed my father a lot when I was younger. He was a caring person, and he was the one that pushed me into medical practice.

"He bought me the most expensive beast gear which money could buy at the time when the war broke out. He never directly showed he cared about me but did do in weird ways, but I never saw some of the sides of him that you are describing, and I would have liked to have seen that.

"I know you said you are looking into turning the vampire soldiers back to human, but I believe it will be a long time before you do that. You need the vampires at this moment. Anyone could see that.

"I want to know why he went through this change, Quinn, and judging from your story and what you told me, it all happened with you. This whole world changed with you, and I even remember seeing you the first day. I never thought this would be the situation.

"I want to follow you, Quinn, and pursue in my father's footsteps. I want to do everything he has done and follow through his steps to see what he did, so I am asking you right now. Please, Quinn, if you can." Hayley then stood up from her seat and bowed down. "Can you please turn me as you did him?"

If Quinn were drinking something, he would have spat it out. Because not an hour had passed, two ladies had requested the same thing.

"Please understand it from my point of view," Hayley said, lifting her head, but all she saw was Quinn with his hand out.

"You don't have to say anymore. I know by now that I'll always lose this type of conversation. So after I tell you all the risks, I'll let you decide and will see, alright?" Quinn sighed.

However, this time, Quinn didn't know that the results of the change would be vastly different from what Samantha had turned into.

[Congratulations you have successfully created a Succubus]

# Chapter 1485 - A Growing Desire
Although they were at the centre of the reception room, Quinn felt like there was no need to drag things on and do Hayley's transformation somewhere else. If she turned into something dangerous, he had enough strength to subdue her before she went berserk.

Of course, he was still worried. The more he turned people, the more chance he had of hitting one of the bad subclasses.

The others in the room would constantly glance over to see what Quinn was doing. However, everyone here already knew what he was and saw that Hayley had requested this. They weren't just regular members of the Cursed faction but the leaders, and it wasn't like he was going against her will or forcing her into the ritual.

A drop of blood had initiated the ritual process, just like with Samantha. Quinn still had plenty of slots that he would always leave open, a little over 10. He kept it this way because he remembered when Vincent once told him that perhaps he might need to use it on those he truly cared for one day.

In some cases, if someone really wanted to be turned, like those in the Cursed faction, he would get the other vampires to do it, so it wouldn't take up his slots. The connection with Hayley just felt too personal for that, though.

Like Samantha, Hayley took it quite well once the turning process started. It was clear that she was going through pain as the veins popped up on her neck, and blood passed through them at a quick rate.

A few grunts of pain here and there, but other than that, she didn't show any signs of backing down.

'Are women just better at handling pain than most men? Or does it have something to do with the transformation?' Quinn wondered.

At the same time, he was thinking about just what Hayley would turn into. He found it strange that Samantha had turned into a B Subclass, an undead. Especially since she was nowhere close to being dead when turned, however, he did remember his thoughts before.

Although certain things might influence the result, they weren't the main factor to give a hundred percent guarantee about the outcome of the transformation. It was just that the chances of turning into that subclass were a bit more than the rest. At the same time, all choices were still available on the wheel.

Watching carefully, Quinn waited for the result and to see if Hayley would need any help; however, just then, someone came bursting through the reception doors.

The person pushed the doors so hard they had nearly come off their hinges, and everyone turned to look at who it was. Two figures had entered the room, one in heavy black armour, the royal knight Muka, and by her side was another royal knight, Fex.

Quinn knew Fex wasn't in a good mood, judging by his face.

"Quinn, I need to talk to you!" Fex yelled across the room.

'Uh, no, I mean, I knew he would react badly, but what is this?' Quinn frowned inwardly.

Luckily, it seemed like Muka still had some sense and was by Fex's side, trying to calm him down, and jumped in between the two of them before this turned into a scuffle.

"Don't forget he is still your king," Muka said, placing her hands on Fex's shoulder and slightly forcing him back. Fex's legs were still walking forward, but he wasn't moving anywhere.

"Yeah, well, this isn't me talking to Quinn as a royal knight; this is me talking to him as a friend!" Fex moved his head and looked at Quinn in his eyes, "Why didn't you tell me you were going to turn Samantha? You don't think I deserved to know?"

"Of course you did," Quinn replied while keeping one eye on Hayley, who was still sitting down. "But Samantha is an adult, and both of you have only started dating recently. She had already made up her mind to do this, Fex. Do you think if you talked to her, she would have changed her decision?"

"Of course!" Fex yelled back. "She might have just been emotional at the time. Maybe I could have calmed her down, and what would you have done if she changed into a subclass that altered her emotions? She could become a different Samantha.

"Or worse, what would you have done if she changed into something like a Wendigo? Would you have killed her and then come to me and said, 'Sorry, Fex, but she told me to turn her'?!"

It was clear why Fex was angry. He was worried for Samantha, worried that he might lose someone he had just gotten close to, and Quinn understood his emotions.

"Fex, I understand, but Samantha made that decision, and I clarified all the risks to her. Even if you were married to her, yes, both of you can make decisions together, but ultimately it would have been up to her. Do you think I like turning people?"

It was then that a groan had come out from the table opposite to Quinn. Fex and even Muka turned to where the sound had come from. It wasn't just any groan. It sounded as if someone had received the ultimate pleasure. As if they had tasted the best dessert in the world.

When turning towards the source of the moan, they could see a female standing. Both of her arms cuddled themselves, and their legs crossed over slightly.

"Quinn…what happened to me… am I a vampire?" Hayley asked, with her face getting red and almost visible 'heat' reeking from her cheeks.

[Congratulations, you have created a Succubus.]

"You turned another one! What the hell are you doing, Quinn?!" Fex clamoured at him again, still angry. When Hayley turned her head towards him, Fex noticed a single horn on the left side of her head. Her usual glasses had fallen on the table, and her braided ponytail was now undone.

Just then, they noticed something waving as well. It was a small thin tail.

It had been a long time since Quinn had seen a new Subclass, although this wasn't his first time seeing a succubus. There was Amy, who was close to Xander in the tenth family. However, he had never created one himself before, so he was a little interested in its ability.

[Infant Succubus: A common feature of a succubus is a single thin red tail along with a small horn sticking out from its left side. Although not all Succubus will have a horn on their head, but will sometimes grow in size depending on their sexual desire.

[Succubus are quite proficient in illusion and healing magic. Magic abilities cast by a Succubus will work more on males, depending on the attraction the latter has for the Succubus. They also have natural energy that will replenish over time; however, they must consume a man's special seed to grow and evolve.

[They often are beings that are said to have no love and only lust. Meaning they are able to bypass boundaries that other blooded can not.]

If Quinn was drinking something, this could have been the second time in one day where he would have spat it out because of the description. Of all the things for Hayley to have turned into, why would it have to be one that was a little tricky? Quinn couldn't help but wonder what could have been the major factor that led to her turning into such a being.

Upon closer inspection, he noticed a few other changes. For one, the size of her chest had gone up by a few notches. Before, if they were the size of apples, now they were like watermelons, and the military uniform she was wearing looked like it was about to tear apart.

"Quinn…I think… I need your help." Hayley said as she sat down, and something could be seen growing from the top of her head on her left side. It started to poke through her hair and was extending with every second.

"The horn… your horn is growing," Quinn said out loud as he was shocked and remembered the description. "How am I meant to help with that?"

"You were the one who turned me into this, so you have to solve this problem," Hayley replied back, sounding a bit out of breath.

*****

# Chapter 1486 - Just Do It!
"Oh my." Were the only words that came out of Muka's mouth upon seeing Hayley's appearance. She had let go of Fex and covered her mouth with one of her hands, and it was one of the very few times when her actions felt womanly.

At the same time, Fex was also awkwardly staring while trying to look away as the Succubus crossed her legs as if she was desperately holding herself from peeing.

"Quinn, you have to do something, don't let her stay in pain!" Fex shouted, holding up his hands in front of his face but at the same time was looking through the finger gaps.

"Uhh…do something? What do you mean by 'do something'?" Quinn stood frozen. He was beyond useless and practically dead weight in this situation, and Muka also knew it.

'Besides, if they are thinking what I think they're thinking, it wouldn't work, right? I mean the bond thing between a turner and the one they create. Although…it did say something about bypassing that type of thing in the system message.

'And… I can still touch Layla. That bond only seems to activate when I feel something. What am I doing? It's like I'm making excuses for why I can do it rather than not!'

Muka was the first one to act. She felt sorry for the young lady and ran across like a hero lifting Hayley on her back and carrying her over her shoulder. It looked like she was getting ready to run out of the room to head to a place that was a little more private than this.

"You two follow me; we need to solve this issue," Muka said, running off. Quinn and Fex looked at each other for a second before immediately following her, leaving everyone in the room who had overheard the conversation to wonder what was going on.

"Did you hear that groan?" One of them asked.

------

Eventually, the three of them had entered a medium-sized room. It was quite fancy inside and similar to a hotel. Everything was clean, untouched, and even a large bed was there. Quinn speculated that this room was most probably prepared for one of the board members to catch a nap or two during their meetings.

He felt like they were lucky to even have the luxury to sleep in a place like this during these times.

Muka placed Hayley on the bed and covered her with a blanket. But Hayley began to toss and turn as her horn grew, although a lot slower than before.

Since no one was around, Muka had taken off her helmet, revealing her face. This time her hair was of nice violet colour, making Quinn wonder if she had dyed it, or he didn't notice it before. He was also naturally drawn to staring at her perfect face, which was even more breathtaking than the beautiful vampires.

It was almost impossible even to describe her, as her face had a look to it like no other.

"You are a troublemaker, aren't you?" Muka giggled. "Creating a succubus of all things."

"Why is she like this?" Quinn asked. "What can we do to help her, or will it eventually pass?"

Fex was pacing up and down the room. For him, it seemed like it was a stressful moment. But there was a slight smile on his face as if he was relishing this, while Quinn was just full of concern and worry.

"I have some knowledge about them," Muka answered, walking over to Hayley, who was still tossing and turning. "When a succubus is first turned, her lust is at its peak, and it's similar to how a newborn vampire reacts upon seeing blood for the first time.

"However, certain things bring this on more to them during this time, for example, men. To them, seeing men would make them feel like how a newborn vampire feels upon seeing a cut on human skin. However, something could worsen this situation even further, and that is Virgin men. It would be like the sweetest blood you have ever tasted dangled in front of the vampires."

It was then that Muka gave a slight glance towards Quinn. It was as if she was asking a question without saying it, and finally, Fex couldn't hold it in anymore as he laughed.

"Hey man, you kinda deserve this and don't look at me. I'm not the one who made her like this."

Quinn's face was turning bright red by the second. It wasn't that he didn't have any interest in women, but when did he have the time for all this? Besides, there were plenty of girls interested in him, and he could have done the deed with any of them, but hey, saving his friends and the world had always been, well, the main priority.

"I guess it's best if Fex and I leave the room? That should solve the problem, right?" Quinn asked.

"Don't you dare, Quinn!" Hayley shouted from her bed. She had lifted her head up, and while she was still red and steaming, she said, "You caused this problem which means you're going to solve it."

"Well, you heard her." Fex patted his friend on the back. "I guess I should leave. This is a perfect room, and she's a good looking woman. All I can say is I hope for the best for you two!"

"Wait! When did I agree to this? Why can't you do it since this all comes naturally to you?" Quinn asked.

"I have Samantha now; I can't cheat on her this soon into a relationship. It would never work out. Besides, I have to help her learn the ropes because someone has created a headache. Don't worry, I won't tell Layla about this, and didn't you say that the two of you couldn't do it anyway? I'm sure even if she finds out, I am sure she will understand."

Fex was already heading out the door, and it looked like Muka was as well. She placed her helmet back on her head and gave a thumbs up towards Quinn.

"I will stay on guard and make sure no one comes inside. Don't worry. I will try not to listen." Muka said as the door was slammed shut.

Now the only ones in the room were Quinn and Hayley. Although Quinn was nineteen years old and an adult, he didn't know how and where to start. However, there was one experience he could draw from, and that was from Vincent's life. It was ironic that Quinn never wanted to try and remember the details.

"Hey, Hayley, does it really have to be me? Don't you have a boyfriend that we can call over? Or I can ask one of the vampire soldiers that doesn't have anyone. Think how awkward it would be between the two of us. I don't think I can even touch you, and the age difference?" Quinn asked, stepping back.

"Age difference?" Hayley asked as she began to unbutton her tight shirt from the top one by one, revealing her clear skin and the top of her large breasts. "I'm only twenty-seven, and Quinn, think about everything you have done.

"You have done so much; this should be nothing for someone like you. This is an easy task, so just please help me!"

———

Outside the room, Fex had decided to leave after some time. Muka was enough to stay in guard, not that they thought anyone would come by anyway. Still, he had a smile that wouldn't settle down. He wasn't happy about Samantha's situation, and now he felt like he had gotten his revenge back somehow.

Little did he know that fate had a strange way of working because after leaving the hallway and entering back in the reception room they were just in, someone approached him.

"Hey, Fex, have you seen Quinn? I was just speaking to Sam, and he said that you ran off with him earlier. I wanted to talk to him about something." It was Layla.

'Why do I have a sudden urge to really try and cause some drama today.' Fex smiled mischievously.

*****

# Chapter 1487 - The Royal Cherry
Although Muka said that she would try not to listen in, it was a hard thing for her to do. The hallway was silent, and, just like any Vampire Lord, her hearing was far sharper than a human's. So if she heard a few noises or two, then no one could blame her… right?

The Royal Knight looked around to make sure nobody would pass by, before taking off her helmet and pressing her ear up against it. She was wondering why there had been no noise for a while now. In her head, all sorts of thoughts were going on.

'It went really silent for a while… did he use his shadow to block out the noise?' Muka thought when suddenly she could hear something. 'Wait, that sounds like…footsteps!' The Royal Knight realised as she quickly placed her helmet back on and stood up straight, pretending to have dutifully done her job all this while. The door swung open and Quinn was seen standing there. He immediately closed the door behind him, and he didn't even look at Muka.

"The issue is resolved." Quinn stated, without any further explanation, using his left hand to pinch the bridge of his nose.

"So…did you do the deed?" Muka asked, intrigued, trying her best to sound neutral. Inside her head, though, she was picturing little babies already, Royal Princes and Princesses. Even though the vampire society didn't quite work like that, chances were that the children of their current King would grow up to become monsters of their own.

"No… not exactly." Quinn replied with his entire face getting red as he looked at his right hand, which immediately disappointed Muka to the point where her shoulders shrugged down. "It turned out… that she didn't need me to do 'that' necessarily… I just gave her… a hand… a shadow hand and… we figured out, she… just needed my… seed."

Quinn had to stop there. He had never felt so embarrassed in his life talking about any matter. For one thing, this was actually the first time he had talked about these types of matters. Growing up he never had anyone to talk to about these types of things, no friends during school, no siblings to inform him, nor any parents to ask them questions.

As such, it wasn't too surprising that he didn't even know how to naturally talk about it. Inside the room, everything had felt awkward to him… even though Hayley had fortunately taken the initiative.

It was then that the two noticed that Fex was walking down the hallway, and he wasn't on his own.

"Hey, are you done already? Well, can't blame you too much for your first time, although you don't look as tired as I would have imagined. Congratulations on popping your Royal Cherry, Your Majesty. " Fex made a formal bow, not even trying to hide the huge grin on his face. He had actually heard everything that was said while walking down the hallway, and by his side, there was no one.

"… alright, I'm sorry, I really shouldn't tease you too much about this. I overheard that you two… came to a 'mutual agreement'… for now. Anyway, you're a good guy, Quinn. A little too good sometimes, so I'll stop giving you a hard time.

"I understand that you did what you did because Samantha asked you to, and while I might not like it, it was still her decision. You have your own struggles to deal with, so I won't drag you into mine."

With one problem solved, Quinn could finally move onto the next matter at hand. Muka had decided to stay with Hayley in case she needed help with other matters. Later on they would arrange her to travel with the bulk of the Cursed faction as she wished to. However, Quinn asked her to wait until him and Fex were gone… as well as to give Hayley time to come to and dress herself properly, though he didn't voice that last part out.

"Ah, by the way, Layla was looking for you, so I told her that you were busy without going into detail. She said it wasn't important and not to worry about it, though if you want my advice, I think you should seriously have a talk with her at some point. At least before you go on your next grand outing. You were the one who told me to act, so as a good leader, shouldn't you be leading by example?"

Quinn did agree with what Fex was saying, even though he noticed the teasing tone in the last statement, the teenage boy required a break after that. He wasn't in his right mind after he had come close to doing what he was about to do, and even then, doing what he did…

'I've had two tough conversations with two strong women today, and I don't think I can deal with a third. … and I should definitely take a long shower after what I just did… although it was in the shadow space. At least I can take comfort in that.'

As usual, Quinn was busy as there was always something to do around the ship, and he decided to head out to the field after getting a report from Sam. Out where the VR platform would take place was the ship the vampire soldiers had landed in and infant of it, making preparations was Ashley, along with a few of the Unranked including Abdul and Sera.

Quinn had a catch-up with them all, apologising to them for not being able to act sooner to protect their families, yet nobody blamed him. They all knew what the situation was like. The Cursed had learned of the V, yet no one knew about them.

Asking for their families, not even their families would have believed such a tale. With that, Quinn wanted to talk to two more people before heading off.

"Sera, Leo is one of the best people I ever met. You can rely on him a lot." Quinn said. "He will forever be my teacher, and I learn new things from him every day."

Sera looked at the blind man, and he thought well of him, remembering back to his match.

"I think this time, he might learn a few things from me. Don't worry, I will take good care of him." Sera gave Quinn a wink, and knowing what energy resided in him, Leo just nodded his head.

They all got on board the ship, and a short while later it took off. They had a plan with which they slowly would attempt to deal with Pure and take back Earth from them.

Now, it was time for Quinn to make a decision what to do with the Cursed faction and the rest. The Vampire King decided to contact Alex and Andrew, the two main forgers of the Cursed faction.

He wanted an update on the vampire leaders' equipment. According to Alex, thanks to the new crystals that they had obtained from the vampire settlement and learned about, they were able to upgrade everything considerably and work at a better rate.

In fact, he estimated that they would be done in the next few days, which meant, after the armour was done, Quinn and Sam would have to plan their attack on the Dalki.

Armed with that knowledge, Quinn decided to head back in, and he was making his way to the reception where Sam was. He was hoping to call a meeting along with Sach and Owen, to try to see if they could all attack at the same time. They needed to discuss things in great detail.

However, while he was on his way there, he bumped into someone who he wasn't expecting or called. In the hallway, leading from the arena to the stadium, was Jin with his arms crossed.

As soon as he saw Quinn, he gave a respectful bow, and stood upright again.

"I have a report to make, Your Majesty." Jin stated. "A little while ago, you asked one of the families to search our solar system in need of a Nest Crystal. I was the one that had taken on that role and I have just received a report. I've just been contacted that my family has finally found one."

A large grin appeared on Quinn's face, everything was falling into place nicely. It was time to level up his system and bring out the full power to take on Graham.

*****

# Chapter 1488 - The Final War
When seeing a nest crystal in person, there was the opportunity for Quinn to use it to upgrade his system. There were two in total, and Quinn had decided to use one for Vincent's body, and not for a single moment did he regret that decision.

Although he never intended it to work out like this, it was a good thing that he could have a clone of himself, and it had come in handy during the Pure situation. On top of that, every time he saw Vincent, a warm feeling would overcome him. It was one of the decisions he was happy about.

The other nest crystal was used to continue creating the human clones to feed their blood to the vampires. Still, he hadn't given up on finding a nest crystal and had decided to ask for one of the vampire families to search for it.

Before Quinn went off to meet Sam and the others, Jin, the fourth family leader and the one in charge of the expedition, came forward to talk about something. The two of them walked slowly into the stadium to speak their mind.

"I don't want to be the bearer of bad news, and neither do I want you to think my family is incompetent, but there is a little bit of a problem," Jin informed his king. "My expedition team has requested help.

"It seems they are unable to get the crystal because of some unforeseen troubles and have asked for support. I understand that you said this was important to you, so I wanted to suggest sending some of the vampire leaders, including myself, to gather the crystal for you."

Quinn remained silent and thought for a moment. He wanted to prioritise the System upgrade, but he was unsure what it would do at the end of the day. Would it allow him to continue gaining stats, unlock skills? Or would it show an error due to Richard fully unlocking the system?

"Are there other options? Shouldn't there be more nest crystals?" Quinn asked.

"Yes, this is the first one we have come across," Jin replied. "Of course, we can continue searching, but we don't know how long it will take. Depending on the beasts protecting it, the difficulty to get the nest crystal will vary.

"It might be an easy task or become an impossible one. This one seems slightly difficult, but if a few leaders were to join hands, the progress would speed up."

Quinn had heard enough, and before that, he thought it would be best to talk to Sam about everything together. This meeting wasn't only for those in the Cursed faction. Members of the Earthborn group and those from the Graylash family would also attend this meeting. But before the main meeting started, Quinn wanted to talk with Sam about what had just been discovered.

"Hmm, and were you thinking of getting the nest crystal yourself?" Sam replied as if he could read a part of Quinn's mind.

"It did cross my mind," Quinn replied. "But I think at this moment, it's too dangerous for me to leave."

"But if you send the leaders away instead, then we would be sending a major portion of our forces. If we start an attack, there is a good chance that the Dalki will retaliate. I agree with what you said before. Attacking now while they're not ready is the best option. We don't know how long getting the nest crystal will take. You know better than anyone that you can't be everywhere at once. Let's discuss it with everyone." Sam said with a smile, still undecided about the whole situation.

All of the sofas were moved to one side of the room, facing the opposite wall, and Sam stood facing everyone. He was taking charge of the whole meeting. The Cursed faction made arrangements for the other groups, and the latter didn't have complaints about that.

If they didn't agree to something, they could always disagree and dispute it during the meeting.

"As you know, we have talked multiple times over the last few days, and so has Quinn and me, and the decision between everyone and what everyone believes we should do right now…is go on the attack against the Dalki." Sam declared.

No one spoke in objection; rather, they had determined looks on their faces.

"We have been on the defensive since the start of this war, and we finally have this breathing space. Yet there has to be a reason for it.

"As we discussed with the extra power of the leaders, they will be split into the two groups to give support. I am sure you all are thinking about where we will begin and how we can get the public to support us. Well, I have an answer for that."

Upon pressing a little remote, a video appeared by Sam's side, and it showed footage of a certain area in the Vampire Settlement. An area that showed many different kinds of creatures. Their figures looked similar to beasts, demons, things they only saw in nightmares.

"Are these beasts?" Hermes asked.

"No, these are something else," Sam replied. "They are under the command of the vampires. After speaking with the leaders, we have come up with a suggestion: Sunny will lead an attack to take back one of the Cursed faction's planets."

Sunny then stood up from her seat to make everyone aware of her and what she looked like.

"She is the fifth leader, and using the subclasses, as we call them, she will fight the Dalki. No human lives will be lost in the first attack, and it will show the alliance of the humans and vampires going well if the mission is a success.

"Once this mission ends, before the Dalki can even have the time to react, the Graylash and Earthborn group will move to get rid of the Dalki from their planets."

Some in the room were filled with fighting spirit, while a few felt a little prudent about this plan. They knew that defending was always easier than attacking in warfare, and the Dalki was an unknown enemy race. The number of Dalki forces, and their strength, everything was a mystery to them.

"What about One Horn?" One of the generals asked. "He is one of the leaders of the Dalki. Unless we get rid of him, it will be hard for us to move. Will the vampire leaders be enough to take him on?"

"We will give the necessary support for each group. The vampire leaders are strong, and we think that, like before, the Dalki will concentrate their power against the Cursed faction. We will be the charging force in this fight, and if they do focus on the Cursed faction, we will be like a lance destroying all their forces one by one."

The leaders of the Cursed faction had smiles on their faces when Sam said this.

"What about Quinn?" Another general asked. "We know he is the strongest out of all of us. Perhaps he should be the one to take on One Horn? Or will he be able to support us if things go bad?"

When the General asked this question, Sam glanced at Quinn for a moment before responding.

"He has another matter to attend to that will help us win this war," Sam answered. "We are not a one-man army, and no, I'm not stupid enough to think we can win this war without him. That's not what I'm saying, but Quinn has powers that allow us to call him over when we need him.

"If we were to locate Graham, the Dalki known and suspected to be their leader, we know that Quinn is the only one strong enough to help us face off against Graham. However, we have to strike now. The longer we wait, the more chances we're giving them to create an army of Grahams and One Horns. We all saw the Dalki that attacked the Graylash family and how it had gotten stronger. What will we do if it's too late by the time we react?" Sam added, "The vampire leaders are our trump card. They have agreed to help us, but I doubt they would ever think we would go on a full-force attack like this.

"The time to act is now! Understand?!" Sam proclaimed.

There was silence for a moment, and then the members of the Graylash family cheered. Then, those from the other sections cheered as well. Although the event led by the Board never expected this type of response, after seeing the so-called strongest, they had gained confidence in facing the unknown enemy.

"Thank you," Quinn said, placing his hand on Sam's shoulder. "Let's not waste any more time. Everyone, have enough rest. This will be the final war. We either win…or die. And I need to make sure I have the strength to end this.

There's a saying Sam replied.

"We will fight not because we hate what is in front of us, but because we love what is behind us!"

# Chapter 1489 - It Starts Here
After a few more questions from the meeting and the plan's finalisation, Logan handed a communication device to everyone present in the room. This way, they could adjust their strategies as and when needed while also being up-to-date with the situation.

Now, it was no longer about one group outdoing the other. For once, it seemed like everyone was on board with working together and getting rid of the threat. After that, things proceeded swiftly as everyone returned to their respective planets.

There were still a couple of days for preparations to be made, and once the vampire leaders had everything they needed, they would head out to the other planets as well. For now, it was a direct order for them to follow Sam's instructions.

However, if Sam was unavailable, then Muka and Fex were left in charge, which they all happily obliged to.

Quinn was heading out to where the Nest crystal had been discovered. He thought this was the quickest solution for them, to go on the attack while also making it so Quinn could obtain the Nest Crystal as fast as possible.

He was now back at the Daisy planet, where the vampire settlement was presently located. From here, he would use their teleporters to teleport himself to the vampire settlement's previous location.

Apparently, the vampires didn't have teleporters to all of the planets in the solar system. So Quinn would have to be patient while a ship picked him up, and from there onwards, he would head off to the Nest Crystal's location.

This was the faster solution compared to using the abandoned station that linked the beast planet solar system and the vampire one.

'This shouldn't take long. I can't imagine it taking more than two days at most… in the current situation…how many things will happen in two days?' Quinn thought. This was the only thought that would somewhat settle his mind, but he knew that the plans for the attack were now kicked in motion.

Worst case, he would use the shadow to transfer himself to the Cursed faction and help in the fight. For now, he needed to have faith in his comrades.

———

Currently inside a small commercial spaceship were Bonny and Void, the two reporters who became well-known and popular with the general public. Their ship was cruising through space, but it wasn't alone.

A small fleet of the Earthborn group was with them on guard. Although Bonny and Void weren't weak, they weren't strong enough to face the Dalki. Lately, since the news and details to the public were mostly delivered via their Livestream, the military and the other three groups felt it was important to protect them from any threats.

At the moment, the spaceship was on autopilot, heading to their destination. Void was tinkering with his drones and equipment, checking if they were all working alright, while Bonny had been staring outside looking at the fleet.

"Can you feel the tension?" Bonny asked, still staring out the window.

"Tension, you mean the tension of the war? It has always been there." Void replied, nearly dropping his camera off from the table, but he quickly grabbed it before it was damaged. In the pile of equipment, there was even the damaged camera that Quinn had broken.

Thankfully, the Cursed faction had paid for all the repairs and allowed him to get a new one.

"Can't you tell, or am I imagining things? But from all the reports we are getting, things have heated up big time. All the groups are on the move, and this much protection? Before, they would just send one ship to come with us and now a whole fleet."

"You might be right." Void replied, As he tested the camera by taking a snap of Bonny, who looked beyond annoyed when she saw how calm Void was, as the latter quickly placed the camera back on the table. "I mean, whenever the Cursed faction invites us somewhere, it's always for some big news or big attractions, something like that. So it will be the same this time, right?"

"No." Bonny shook her head. "I'm talking bigger than that. This isn't just the Cursed faction; all groups are moving. My sources have been updating me. This isn't the same as before. I think…this might be it."

Bonny's sources were volunteers from all the other planets. Bonny and Void already had their own application created just so people could follow them and get notified when they went live.

Nearly everyone had this application, and that included practically everyone who was not participating in the war. Still, with anyone who became popular, they would have some hardcore fans who wished to help Bonny and Void in any way they could.

Bonny would constantly keep her eye on online forums, chatrooms, blogs, and more. It was a good way to gauge how people were feeling and what they were interested in finding out.

She had read about reports of the Graylash people creating defensive measures and moving all of their members. Some of those from the Earthborn group were doing heavy recruitment. Even those who weren't part of the military were informed that they might have to fight.

All of these were clear signs that they were expecting something, which was why Bonny found it strange that both of them were invited right at this moment.

'The question is, are the Dalki on the move…or is it us?'

Eventually, the spaceship landed on the Daisy planet. However, it wasn't at the same location as before, nor was it a vampire settlement. They could still see the vampire settlement in the distance, but a little further from the main settlement, a miniature shelter had been created; this was the place they were about to land. It had walls and towers just like the main settlement, but even the top was enclosed, giving it an appearance of a giant black block when seen from a distance.

Upon landing, people who helped in escorting them soon left, and there to greet them all was one of the Vampire leaders and by her side were two assistants.

One was a small red-haired teenager with a black rabbit on his shoulder. While the other was an older woman whose beauty was on par with the woman who stood at the front.

Void lifted his heavy backpack with all his equipment inside and took along a few devices. He activated the drones since it was easy to have them active rather than carrying them around, but they weren't recording just yet.

"It's nice to meet you. I remember our visit from last time." Bonny said, bowing down.

Void bowed down as well, but his large back was so heavy it looked like he was about to fall over. Luckily, Rokene, the one with the black rabbit, had quickly gone to his side to grab him and propel him up straight again.

"Thank you." Void replied.

'We do have speed ability users, but not many people choose that ability. It's still strange to know that vampires can move that fast.' He thought.

"What is this facility?" Bonny asked, looking around, and she was half expecting to see Quinn or someone else to help explain what was going on.

"Oh, I see that you haven't been informed. I suppose you don't know what is happening, do you?" Sunny smiled as she turned around and went to enter the facility.

For now, Rokene had offered to carry Void's heavy bag, and usually, Void would have said no, but then he noticed that it was almost weightless for the teenager to carry.

They had entered the settlement, but the room was dark, too dark for them to see since the facility didn't get any sunlight from above.

"They have a request. They wish for you to film the first attack against the Dalki race for the whole world to see. And as the fifth leader of the vampire society, I will be leading the attack." Sunny explained.

Void was turning on his camera, not to record but to help him see what exactly was in the room because they could hear countless snarls and strange noises they had never heard before, which was, quite frankly, worrying them.

When Void saw what was around them through the camera, he immediately had an intense urge to put it down.

"Don't worry; you are free to record because the whole world will see them soon. Lights!" Sunny asked, and crystals started to shine, showing the whole facility full of the dangerous subclasses that Sunny would use in the attack.

*****

# Chapter 1490 - It Starts Here (Part 2)
Every bone in Bonny's body was shaking, and it was for more reasons than one. The reporter herself wasn't sure if it was due to fear or the excitement of a good story. When looking around as well, she still didn't know what was causing the two different emotions in her.

Looking around, the room was filled with all sorts of creatures, but her mind was racing, thinking about what they might be planning to do with them after the information she had just been told. Rather than seeing what was actually in front of her.

Void had seen this look on Bonny many times. It was one of her charms, but also at times it would allow the two of them to face unpredictable dangers.

"I told you I was right." Bonny whispered, elbowing Void in his side. However, her friend seemed far too distracted to reply. He held the camera firmly in his hand, and he seemed to be mouthing words, or repeating them over and over.

'You're just filming a movie, that's all this all is. You're just filming a movie.' Void kept reminding himself as he captured everything in there on film.

Still, Bony wouldn't let her partner get her down. It seemed like her instincts were right, and something big was about to happen. Of course, they couldn't tell them about the attack before hand, just in case they planned to leak it so soon.

"There are so many different looking creatures here." Bonny exclaimed.

The creatures or vampire subclasses had been kept behind reinforced glass. Somewhat similar to what was used at the event. The glass divided the different areas that would have the different dangerous subclasses in them. In a way, it felt somewhat similar to visiting a zoo on Earth… only that everything inside could and was dying to kill you.

Most of the compartments the creatures were stored in were the same, just a piece of land with a few trees here and there, but there were also a few that were quite different. They had cave-like designs or even some large bodies of water.

Apparently, some Subclasses required a more unique environment.

"Indeed." Sunny nodded. "And we will be using all of them to help us in this upcoming fight."

The first container they walked up to, Bonny could see tall, skinny creatures. Their skin was pale, almost grey in colour. Their eyes were sunken in and all of them were bald.

They lacked any muscle on their bodies, giving them quite the skeleton-like figure, but what looked horrifying was their eyes that were all just a shade of white.

"Wendigos." Sunny answered even though no one had asked, at least not yet. "These creatures have incredible regeneration capabilities and despite their looks, they have enough strength to back it up as well. These are the most common type and will make up the bulk of our army."

When looking at how large the facility was, and how many subclasses there were, Bonny estimated there to be around 10,000 creatures in total in a place like this. Sure, it was nothing compared to the human population, but against the Dalki they needed strength more than numbers.

It was then, one of the Wendigos started clawing at the glass, banging on it, and a few more started running over as they stared at Bonny and Void. It seemed like Void's little sutra was no longer effective, as the cameraman was startled and started to back up slowly.

"Don't worry, they're not strong enough to break that. Go away!" Sunny shouted and for some reason, it seemed like they listened to her.

Still, Void being scared continued to back up, step by step, until he heard a loud bang from behind. He jumped up and nearly dropped his camera. Still, he was a professional and caught it quickly. As soon as he did, he turned around to see what had scared him.

A large creature that looked to be made of nothing but flesh, on all fours. It would open its mouth from time to time, which would split into several parts. What was scary about it was what looked like skulls on their stomach.

"A Mouth Spitter, fast, agile, and they have a special trick up their sleeve for certain opponents. Come on, let's continue this little tour." Sunny explained, as she continued to show them around the place.

The two humans quickly followed, as they were a little worried about being away from the only one that seemed to be able to control them. Next up on the right side in another glass container, there were multiple trees inside.

It looked similar to a forest but the truck of the trees were large and looked to all be slightly carved. Zooming in with his camera, Void was able to get a better look at what they were and could see a creature holding its knees. It was covered in dark fur and its head looked almost like an owl, yet its body resembled that of a human.

It was rocking back and forth, and large wings behind could be seen.

"Those will be part of our Air Force, the Strzyga. Be careful though, if they manage to catch you they will eat your body from inside out, leaving your skin for last. They have a tendency to pretend to be human. They can't fully talk, but they can put together a few sentences here and there, similar to that of a parrot."

"Are all the creatures here dangerous?" Bonny asked, thinking how the Wendigo's had acted and based on what Sunny had told them.

"Yes, however, I'm able to control them somewhat. My ability allows me to even communicate with their human side, I guess or vampire side. Normal voices don't seem to reach them but mine does. However, when they see humans, their thirst for blood, flesh, gets the better of them.

"Which is exactly why they will be perfect against the Dalki."

Turning to the opposite container. Void was trying to get a look at some other creatures. They had been in here a while now, and he felt more confident that there wouldn't be a breakout. That's when he spotted something resembling a goat with a large horse-like head. So far it was the most normal of the creatures he had seen.

For this one, he had gotten quite close to the glass, trying to capture their every detail. When getting closer, it opened its mouth and its tongue lashed out, hitting the glass. It spread out like an octopus body and started pulsating.

"You're lucky the glass is there. That's a Sigbin. Just like most other creatures it feeds off of blood, but it can actually absorb your blood even through the glass, so I would be careful." Sunny warned.

The tour continued with Sunny explaining all the dangerous subclasses, for a total of fifteen different kinds. None of them normal, and the things they could do would give children nightmares for months.

When the tour ended, it looked like Sunny's two assistants had gone off to do some work, and they could hear the sound of spaceships starting on the outside.

"You two came here via your own spaceship, correct? Just like the time before, it would be best if you filmed this fight from above. As I said, I can't control them when humans are around. Naturally, I hope you can cut these details from your report. We don't want to scare the humans." Sunny requested.

"We understand." Bonny nodded, waiting for more to be said, but the only thing that followed was an awkward silence between the two.

"You two should start moving now. Because in a second, all of these creatures will be released. That was my signal to tell you we are going into battle now, and it would be good if you could start filming from this point onwards as well." Sunny smiled.

She didn't have to say it twice, both Bonny and Void started running, heading out of the facility, but the smile couldn't stop showing on Bonny's face.

'The Dalki, they won't know what's coming to hit them!' Bonny thought.

*****

# Chapter 1491 - Black Crates Of Death
After the Dalki attack in the beast solar system, each of the three groups had decided to concentrate their forces onto three planets. They mainly moved using the active teleporters stationed at each Shelter.

Something that the Dalki were unaware of was the fact that their jammers no longer had any effect, thanks to a particular member of the Green family. This move had saved many lives and even forced the Dalki to stop attacks.

However, it seemed like the Dalki were now playing a waiting game. There was a mothership on each planet alongside a fortress with enough numbers to protect the planet from being taken over again. At least they would be able to hold off until reinforcements arrived.

As time passed, eventually, the resources needed for war, the crystals, would reduce, and the Dalki could then make their move. This was one of the reasons why the Dalki had yet to attack. One of the theories, at least. Another guess among those in the cursed faction was that the former might be planning something big.

For one, the Dalki now had half of the Demon-tier Dragon, which would be a huge boost to their already overpowering strength. Even the planets where Quinn had destroyed a mothership were eventually reclaimed—leaving each group with only three of the planets.

"All the teleporters on the beast planets are destroyed, so that's why we need to travel by ship. Honestly, I'm quite surprised that Dalki didn't retaliate to Quinn's little stunt on the Daisy planet." Bonny said, gazing out of the window as usual.

They were flying towards one of the Beast planets, but it was more nerve-racking this time since they were heading straight into enemy territory. Just like last time, Bonny and Void were in their own ship.

It was fast, agile, and small, exactly how they wanted it to be. Although it had no weapons or defences on board, it was a small target to hit compared to the other ships with them this time.

For one, there was a large dropship. They were one of the largest ships used in war and would often carry fleets of Mechs, which were predominantly used in the first war. Since abilities at the time hadn't developed up to the current level thus, mechs were the most promising thing they had against the Dalki.

Bonny knew what exactly was inside the place.

"Hello everyone, you are now watching Bonny and Void's live stream. Today, the Cursed faction has invited us to show you something spectacular once again. As you all know, Quinn had announced that those that we know as V, the vampires, have teamed up with the human forces, and today is the day."

The Livestream had started as soon as they had approached the planet, with around a two-minute live delay.

"What is this? Is it a planned attack?" One of the users commented on the livestream.

"Another stunt from the Cursed faction. You know this is all fake, right? How else can they perfectly time things? I bet they're working with the Dalki or something!"

"Fake? This is a Livestream, and all the other groups confirm it's happening. I've even talked to some of those in the Daisy Faction who were rescued. How can you say it's fake?"

"See the guy above me? He's another person that's just been paid or is a bot! Don't believe them!"

The reason for the delay, though, wasn't for the public or to censor what might happen. Rather, it was because they knew that the other side would be watching as well.

At the moment, Graham was in his lab. A place he hadn't come back to, too often these days, and he had just received a signal that a certain live stream was starting. Once he found out what was happening, rather than panicking, he smiled.

"So you finally make your move. Did we take too long?" Graham had an amused expression.

The dropship hovered above the Shelter, which was mostly destroyed, like when the Dalki had taken over the Daisy faction. There was a group of around two hundred Dalki present at the scene.

But the mothership or the Dalki Fortress was not here. Still, it was perfect for displaying just how strong the attacking force would be.

The hatch underneath the ship was opened while still hanging in the air, and then heavy metallic crates were dropped from the sky.

As they fell from the sky and crashed on the Shelter, their sheer weight had crushed or flattened whatever was left of the Shelter. A One-Spiked Dalki had even jumped attempting to punch the crate, but it did nothing to stray its course and even crushed the latter's body underneath as it crashed on the ground.

"Those crates look strong. I wonder what material they are made out of? According to the Cursed faction, the vampires have discovered many materials and elements that we have yet to discover, and I'm guessing that these crates are one of them." Bonny reported.

As expected, though, Void started to move the drones and their small ship into position to get a clear view because they knew exactly what was coming out of those crates. Fifteen black crates in total, and inside them were fifteen different subclasses.

Steam escaped from the black crates as the doors slowly opened. As a small gap formed, a creature's hand slammed out and scratched the crates. Gradually, its arms, legs, mouths, and whole body moved out. Once there was enough space, the horde of creatures went out in the open.

They spread around and ran as fast as they could towards the first thing they saw. From one of the crates, winged creatures stormed out like bats, leaving in groups and heading towards the Dalki, which were on top of buildings.

On one of the buildings was a group of five Dalki. It looked like they were on top of an apartment-like building. It was at that moment that the group of Strzyga, the owl-like creatures, had caught the eye of them.

Immediately, hundreds of them went storming through the air towards the group. Witnessing this, the group of Dalki wasn't afraid. Before, they had faced hundreds of humans, so why would this be different? As the leader of the flying creatures pounced at them with its mouth open wide, the Dalki threw out a punch, hitting it right on the face.

"These are weak!" The one who had punched exclaimed.

His strength had come through, and the creature's face was crushed, causing it to plummet in an instant. The situation was the same with the others, that was until the others Strzyga had pierced their fangs onto the Dalkis' arms.

The other Strzyga clawed at the Dalkis' skin, and there wasn't a spot on their body that wasn't under attack. Their claws and fangs tore through the hard scales on their bodies. The Dalki tried to fight back, ripping the creatures off thier bodies and slamming them into the ground, but he and the rest were overwhelmed again after a few seconds.

The Strzyga were just too many. Once they had created an opening in his body, they started to feed on thier insides. Then finally, their powerful jaws allowed them to feast on their skin as well.

After having their feast, the owl-like creatures all stood on top of the building, looking out and searching for their next target.

"These are weak…these are weak." A few of them repeated like a parrot. As they mocked the last words of the Dalki, they had just feasted on.

The cameras had caught all of this. The Dalki being overwhelmed gave a different feeling from when they saw Quinn and the vampire leaders. The camera switched to the other creatures; many were dying but, but they were also quickly taking on the Dalki by overwhelming the latter and not caring about themselves.

The viewers once again were divided. Some were thankful that the vampires had the power to help them in this war and defeat the Dalki, while others thought at what cost. Perhaps they were being saved by creatures far stronger than their understanding.

Eventually, all of the Dalki in the Shelter were dealt with, and the dangerous subclasses began to look around for more.

"I guess it's time for me to make my entrance as well," Sunny said.

She jumped down from the large ship and landed directly in the centre. This time, she looked different and was covered with top-tier beast gear from head to toe.

Most of it was dyed in a white and gold colour. This was based on Sam's advice. The dark colours gave off an ominous feeling to the human; thus, he wanted the vampire leaders to change their appearance. He felt this was perfect for someone like Sunny, who gave a motherly feeling.

Her armour was quite a unit, with broad shoulders. However, she wore a light robe for easy movement while wearing sacred armour over the top here and there.

All of the creatures turned towards Sunny and inched their way towards her as if they were about to go for her next, but she smiled at them, lifting her hand.

"Relax, I am not your enemy…and we have more to deal with." Sunny asserted.

The creatures momentarily stood there and stopped stepping forward as if they were waiting for her next instructions, and all Sunny did was point at the Dalki mothership.

"That is your next target."

*****

# Chapter 1492 - New Gen Is Here
There was quite a bit of land between the Shelter and where the Dalki mothership had landed. At the moment, a single vampire was leading the charge, running across the dry land.

The land they were currently on was pretty open. Almost an empty wasteland with next to no green or water. There was bound to be some more habitable place on this planet, but this wasn't it. However, that might be a good thing, for this area was destined to paint the land red and green.

On camera, it was a strange sight to behold, for Sunny was running out front, while an army of around 10,000 creatures were following her from behind. Some of them flew while others galloped, and there were even creatures who crawled beneath the ground.

While this was taking place, the livestream was showing the events that had been recorded in the Shelter. Due to the drones, there were multiple things that had been filmed at once. All the footage that Void was taking would then be edited by another team of helpers, allowing the viewers to not miss anything.

Right now, during this time, the viewers were watching each of the devastating creatures attack the Dalki. They had mainly seen the attack from the flying owl-like creatures known as the Strzyga. Now they were witnessing the other creatures in action as well.

"Did you see those Dalki? They could hardly do anything! Maybe we can win this war. I was beginning to lose hope."

"Clam down, they mostly just went against one spike and two spikes. These were just a few leftovers to look after the Shelter, this doesn't mean anything."

"Yeah, but hardly any of those creatures died, do you really think they will have trouble taking over the fortress?"

"You are all worried about the wrong thing. Did you SEE those creatures?! What do you think would happen if they decided to attack us instead?! What if there were still humans at that Shelter?!"

"Calm down, small brain. Didn't you see, she can control them? They're all following the MILF!"

"My point exactly, 'genius', THEY can control them! For argument's sake, suppose they're on our side NOW, what do you think happens once the Dalki are gone? What's stopping them from attacking us after all of this is over? I don't like it, I don't like it at all."

"I'm tired of this. What's the point of all this fear mongering? The vampires are helping us now. They didn't attack us before, even though they had all these things. So stop complaining."

"They only got involved in this fight because we were losing the war. They just couldn't sit around and watch their food source dying out."

———

'So the vampires have joined in the war as well.' Graham thought to himself as the Dalki leader looked over at a smashed glass container. Previously, it held the original body of their creator, but now it was empty. 'Your predictions are all going wrong.'

"I believe you said there was a low chance of them getting involved. Even if the vampires did join this fight, it would only be when the humans were on their last legs. When we were attacking Earth, I somewhat believed you. If you were still here, I would have cloned you, just to hear your pathetic excuse for being wrong this time." Graham mumbled to himself as he continued to watch the livestream.

———

Eventually, the Dalki fortress came into sight. It had the large towers and the thick black walls that were prominent in all the Dalki fortresses. It was more guarded as well, and the moment could be seen straight away.

On the wall, around a hundred Dalki were seen looking out towards them. On the ground. There was also a small army. However, Sunny was focused on a certain someone. There was a Dalki that stood on top of the wall, as if he was overlooking the entire situation, one with three spikes.

Out of the leaders, Sunny wasn't known to be the strongest, and she was known to be gentle due to the nature of her ability. However, there was a difference between what the vampire leaders were like before meeting Quinn and after.

'I have to remember what they taught us. Activate the beast gear.' Sunny reminded herself.

Energy started to pass through the beast gear, and in turn, the vampire felt a rise in strength. Her whole body felt lighter and stronger. The next second, she ran across the field, running ahead of all the creatures.

Then, when she was close enough, she leaped over all the Dalki that were on the ground. Seeing her in the air, two of them jumped off the wall and tried to intercept her. Focusing more, it was time for her to bring out one more item.

In her hands, she held two what looked like solid metal bars. However, in between them there were links, small chains. In total, there were six links making it look like a whip. The large rods between the chains made it, so it didn't look like a whip. The head at the bottom and top had a spear head.

Immediately, she started to swing it above her head, and swung it down, cutting one of the Dalki across diagonally. It had gone through it smoothly in one motion. Its blood had gotten on her Inner Blood Weapon.

The spare parts of the strange weapon started to fill with the green blood, and when she swung it again, this time it was extending and getting longer. More links of solid rod parts to the weapon were forming seemingly out of thin air, and now the weapon had reached a length of four metres.

Sunny spun it again, slicing the other Dalki's arm off before it could reach her. The weapon then went around the back of the Dalki, and the vampire grabbed the other end. Suddenly, from the solid parts of the weapon, a red aura similar to that of a Blood swipe was fired from the weapon. Pulling it forward, the Dalki was sliced in half.

A rain of green blood dropped down and she avoided most of it, but made sure to take some of the Dalki blood inside her as well. Giving her more strength.

All of this had happened while Sunny had still been in midair. Eventually she had landed right in the centre of the fortress, on top of them all. She kicked the three spiked Dalki in the chest. He didn't fall, but he was certainly pushed back.

His body skidded across the wall until he stopped by the edge. All the others on the wall had come towards Sunny, but with her weapon she sliced them all up. Swinging it about, the chained spear was Sunny's Inner Blood Weapon, and it looked like all her training had paid off, as ten Dalki had been dealt with in an instant.

The Inner Blood Weapon, the training with the other leaders, and the beast gear. Before the vampire leaders would have struggled to fight against a three spiked Dalki, perhaps she had similar power to that of a four spike, but with all the improvements the leaders were no longer the same as before.

"We're going to take back this planet." Sunny claimed looking at the three spiked Dalki. The creatures below had slammed into the Dalki army. The flying subclasses had landed on top of the wall and were already attacking the Dalki on the walls as well, and it didn't take long for Sunny to finish off their leader.

Next on the list was the mothership, but the world had already seen what they wanted to show them. That the vampires had joined in this fight, and that they wouldn't allow the Dalki to have their way like they had done so far.

——

Seeing all of this from his lab, a certain Dalki leader smiled. The sound of the door had just closed as he had been delivered some news from the others.

'Haha, what perfect timing. Just as the vampires have made their attack, we are finally ready to make ours as well. The new generation of Dalki has finished their training, and I can't wait to see how effective they'll be out on the battlefield.' Graham thought to himself, his smile turning to an evil grin.

*****

# Chapter 1493 - The Cursed Forces
The live stream continued even after Sunny had beaten the suspected leader of the fortress, but instead of a battle, everyone witnessed a massacre. It was clear that the Dalki could not deal with the strange variety of creatures the vampires had brought with them.

At the same time, Sunny's strength herself was too overwhelming for any of the Dalki present to handle.

They were panicked, and at the centre of it all, Sunny was taking on the stronger ones, making them lose any hope they were holding on to. However, what the viewers were interested in was how the vampire and subclasses would take on the Dalki ship.

All of the Dalki ships had a force shield that could withstand humanity's old weapons, and even the latest ones struggled to take them on. Even the weapons they had created powered from beast crystals couldn't penetrate the strong shield.

The only one who managed to take down the Dalki motherships was Quinn. That was due to him having two different skills, the Demon tier Amulet controlling a Dalki pretending to be one of their own and the shadow ability, which allowed him to pass through any material.

Noticing that the ship was on its last struggle, Sunny had called for help from one of the Strzyga. She then climbed up on the latter's back in the next instant and then went to the ship above.

'Crystals power the force shield, and it can automatically detect when an attack is heading its way. It doesn't coat the ship itself but the area around the ship. So if one can get right up to the ship and touch the exterior, then physically hitting it will also work.' Sunny thought. 'The only problem is, no one in the past had even gotten close to one of these Dalki ships in the first place, and usually the Dalki wouldn't let you just hit the ship as one wished. At the same time, the exterior of these ships is as strong as the walls of our castles.'

It was then that Sunny pulled something out from underneath her shirt that looked like a strange crystal. It was as clear as glass, but inside, it was a dim glow, and with how she held the Crystal, it looked as if the glowing thing inside the Crystal was moving, floating like water in a glass.

'Using this will be a lot easier. I hope the testing was worth it.' Sunny thought.

Getting close to the ship, she leapt off from the Subclass, and it quickly went back to join the others that were taking out leftover Dalki's in the fortress. Sunny had grabbed onto the exterior at the ship's back to balance herself.

Then she held the Crystal carefully and started to focus. It didn't take long until she felt that her body was phasing through the ship and soon appeared on the other side.

'It worked, and that was far easier than I thought it would be. If Quinn is right, there's a chance of a few four spiked Dalki in the ship, so I will have to use all my strength.'

Placing the Crystal away for safekeeping, Sunny was happy to inform the others that they now had an easier way to infiltrate the Dalki motherships. After discovering that Pure had used a particular type of Crystal that allowed one to store abilities, the vampires had sorted through their Crystal to find more about the Crystal in question.

They had many different types of crystals, and the fourth expedition team had even brought back some of what were suspected to be the storage crystals. One of the abilities that some vampires had was a phasing ability. It allowed them to go through any object. Still, it was considered a weak ability due to not directly increasing one's combat powers.

It had its uses, and it was one of the abilities that vampires and humans could both learn. They had learned through various tests that the storage crystal could take the ability from the user and place it inside the Crystal without the need to kill the original ability owner.

However, then that said person would no longer have any ability and wouldn't be able to learn a new one either. The Crystals' power was similar to Truedream's, with minor distinctions.

For one, the Crystals couldn't pass on the ability to another person, but anyone who held them could use the said power. The second thing was that the capability of the stored ability was far weaker if only taken from one ability user. The power taken wasn't equal to the power stored in the Crystal.

And last but not least, only one ability could be stored and used in the Crystal, unlike Truedream who could store multiple. They had done a few tests. For the sake of the war, they distributed these crystals to the leaders and a few others.

The Dalki's were thoroughly suppressed in the current battle. The cameras, of course, could no longer follow Sunny after she had entered. Regardless, It didn't take long to defeat the fortress, and soon the ship too began to descend from the sky and land.

Sunny had taken over the mothership, and they had reclaimed another planet. For the Cursed faction, this was a complete victory.

Sunny appeared, and she soon gathered all of the beasts. Around one-tenth of the forces had perished in this battle to reclaim the planet, still leaving about nine thousand creatures. This gave the viewers faith that they could also reclaim the other planets.

Without wasting time, Sunny moved and headed back to the shelter with her army and returned to her ship with the other crates. In the meantime, Bonny and Void had an announcement to make.

The Livestream had switched to the two inside the ship as Bonny began to speak.

"As you can see, one of the vampire leaders who is working under Quinn, the Cursed faction leader and our ally in this war, has just reclaimed the planet. And before we end the stream, I have an announcement to make: This doesn't end here. The attack has just begun!"

Many didn't know what Bonny meant by that, but soon the whole world would understand. While Sunny was attacking the planet, the other teams were also moving. There were no reinforcements for Sunny because everyone else was occupied with their own task.

The Graylash family had three operating forces moving out. Along with the vampire leaders and more, same with the Earthborn group. Then finally, there was the Cursed faction as well. Their first task in their attack was to quickly eradicate the Dalki, which had set up bases on the forfeited planets, and from there, the attack would continue full force ahead of the Dalki planets and finish the Dalki off once and for all.

The Cursed faction had planned to have the most impact in this war.

Three large forces from the Cursed faction had just landed on their respective planets. Leading one group was Sam, with Layla, a few of the other Cursed leaders, and a large force, mainly from the Daisy faction with the two sisters by their side. There were also a select few vampire leaders.

Then, another force that had confidence in this war consisted of the members of the Blade family. The three brothers and half-brother were all together, leading a strong, unmatched force.

Including Sunny, four great forces from the Cursed faction were taking battle and strong enough to take a fortress on their own. When the Cursed members and the other groups were informed about the Cursed faction's plans, even though the former believed in the capabilities of this group, they were mindful of two of the four Cursed faction groups.

One of them being Sunny's group. No one had a clear idea of how strong the Subclasses were, but she had just proved herself live. As for the other group from the Cursed faction, it was led by Peter.

"We don't have to worry about him at all." Sam smiled as if reading others' thoughts, "That guy…is a monster now."

# Chapter 1494 - The Best Reinforcements
All three groups had shortly started to move out as soon as Sunny's attack had begun. They felt like this was the best course of action. Not only would they catch the Dalki off-guard, but the general public who weren't taking part in it were also unaware of it.

However, out of all of the groups, one struggled to move out more than the others, and it was the Earthborn group. A Dalki fortress was set up on all the captured Earthborn planets. Even on those where the humans were currently still present, but the motherships had left a long time ago.

This caused frequent scuffles on the planets, with either side trying to hurt the other seriously. With the plan set in motion, the group relied on all of the attack forces to get rid of the Dalki on their planet. They would then set off and attack the other planets taking back what was once theirs.

If they were too slow, the Dalki would call on reinforcements or prepare themselves before they arrived. However, hopefully, the Dalki would have other problems to deal with.

One of the Earthborn groups was being led by Longblade. He had been promoted since the war had started.

He was able to acquire many accomplishments after what had happened with Quinn. It wasn't just him; rather, it was almost as if his whole group was now working as one unit together. Allowing them to take on whatever was in their way.

His teamwork and communication were what they were relying on. Even if he wasn't the strongest amongst those in the Earthborn group.

The third Earthborn group that would be on the attack was one that they were most worried about. For this one, instead of being led by any of the Generals, it was being led by a vampire leader.

This was all due to the incidents that had occurred at the event. There was no one significantly strong who could lead. At the same time, this group had the most vampires in it. In total, three families were a part of the group: The fourth family led by Jin, the twelfth family by Ken Killton, and the eleventh family by Dillan Scutter. The abilities of these three families were some of the strongest abilities the vampires had, and with them, they had brought those from the inner castle who shared their abilities.

To get faster with every strike, to harden a material to be impenetrable and the power of exploding blood. The Generals were aware of their power and would let them take charge due to Sach's orders.

Out of the three groups that the Earthborn was divided into, the final group was the one that everyone was worried about the most because, on one of the planets, they would face One Horn.

Samantha and Sach had returned from the grand event, and Sunny's attack had yet to occur. Currently, a meeting took place on the snow-filled planet in a tent deep inside the Shelter.

"We have sent all of those not battling to planet Billnick." Sargent Fay reported to Sach. "There have also been sightings of One Horn, up until yesterday. While you were away, he did his usual routine; there was no change, sir."

One Horn would constantly walk out in front of the Shelter for some reason, and he did this frequently. He would show up regularly every day. At times would be away for a while, but he would do the same thing after returning.

Higher-ups had instructed everyone not to attack him, and they had already learned their lessons the first few times. Anyone who attacked One Horn would be dealt with, but he would just stand there if they did nothing.

"If One Horn was seen yesterday, then it means he most likely will appear today as well. Just our luck, but we would have to face him sooner than later anyway." Sach said, shaking his head.

"It's not a big deal," Samantha said. "If anything, it's good if we can deal with him here. It would be worrying if the other two groups were to run into him. In fact, we might have to change our plans and derail them just to face him. We beat him here, and he's done for." She clenched her fist and had almost banged it on the table, but someone grabbed it before it could hit.

"Don't hurt your hands, and is One horn really that strong?" Fex asked.

As promised, the Cursed faction stated that they would be sending some help to the other groups. The Graylash group and Earthborn had requested helpers, and some of them were still on their way. They had stated that some preparations needed to be done on the Daisy planet before the rest of the help could arrive.

"He is. Just like Slicer, he's a five spike." Sach replied. "We haven't seen many five spikes, but from those that we have, we can tell that their bodies all seem to evolve and even have a special trait. The scary thing is, when we fought against him in the past, he hadn't used anything like that."

"So we're not sure if he used his full strength back then," Linda added, who was also at the meeting. Quinn had told her to stick close to Samantha since they were the same subclass type. Whenever they had the time, she would guide and teach Samantha about her powers and her struggles.

Samantha had been the busiest out of everyone, along with Linda. She was pressed for time and had a whole new body to get used to.

"Sir!" Just then, a man came running into the tent, huffing and panting; he looked panicked and frightened. The Livestream hadn't started yet, and so far, the Dalki hadn't made an attack even while they were away, but Sach had a bad feeling.

"It's One horn… he's here again!"

Outside the tent, countless Earthborn group fighters were already in their beast gear, ready to move out at any second, preparing for the attack, but Sach chose to wait. He had stated that there would be more to help in the fight, and they would arrive only a little after Sunny began attacking; thus, he was waiting for the right moment.

But what if the Dalki attacked first? This was his worry. Passing through the guards, the ones in the meeting all ran up the wall and stared ahead. It wasn't hard to find the enemy because One Horn stood alone out in the snow.

The snow was thick, going up to One Horn's shins. He stood there with his hands crossed and a smile on his face.

"Wow, these Dalki really are smug, right. I mean, to walk right into the enemy base alone? I have a suggestion. Why don't we give him a nice surprise? I mean, we were going to attack them anyway, right, and now their leader is right here in front of us, alone."

Honestly, Sach and Samantha weren't prepared for this, at least not yet. However, Fex was right. They knew they had to face him but was their strength greater than when they had Oscar and the Demon tier weapon? It was hard to say.

"Everyone!" Sach shouted. "Don't get involved. You will only get in our way! Prepare for battle!"

Sach jumped and landed in the snow. He walked forward with Samantha, Linda, and Fex following him. But he was still unsure if the four of them would be enough.

They soon stood about a hundred metres away from the Shelter and twenty metres away from One Horn.

"Oh, you came out…I thought you would forever hide in your special little Shelter." One Horn said, still with his arms folded. "Do you think you're enough to go against me?"

"Eh," Fex said, calm as ever, and folded his arms as well to imitate One Horn. "Maybe you're right; maybe we aren't strong enough to take you on. I mean, look at those muscles and the spikes on his back. I had trouble taking on three spiked Dalki; you're far stronger than that."

The others looked at Fex and wondered what act he was trying to pull off since he was the one who had suggested to face One Horn earlier. If even the new vampires they brought with them weren't confident, what about the others, who somewhat knew of One Horn's strength.

That was when they all realised that Fex wasn't looking at One Horn but what was behind him. In the sky, something was approaching the Shelter.

"I knew they would send them… I mean, they had to, right?" Fex smiled.

From this distance, three figures jumped out from a large ship. They were like little black spots flying through the sky. Eventually, they landed metres away from One Horn, crashing into the snow and flinging it up everywhere. When the snow finally settled, the others had a better look at the trio's appearance.

Among them was someone who looked like a Dalki, tall and dark-skinned, and it was hard to tell the number of spikes on its back. Then next to them was a female with a pointy hat, Mona, and finally, there was one more.

"Welcome, father-in-law," Fex, with his arms spread wide open, said to the last one.

# Chapter 1495 - Everywhere On The Move
There was one group of people that were made aware of everything that was taking place before the livestream had started. That was of course the vampire settlement. Before the attack had begun, families were split with their forces and were being sent off to help the split Earthborn groups, Graylash groups and the Cursed groups.

The leaders had made an announcement to the people exactly what was going on. Each of the families had decided to bring along the forty from their families that lived in the castle area. They would be taking one of their Vampire knights with them, leaving the other behind, and also would be taking three quarters of those from the inner castle area to participate in battle.

It was a large chunk of their force, and it meant that while away from the Vampire knight, the ten vampires who resided in the castle and those left in the inner castle would be the strongest forces left to defend the place if the Dalki decided to attack them.

As for the vampires in the pooling area, aside from a few that had volunteered, everyone else had been left behind. Although vampires were stronger than humans in this fight, after the Dalki had invaded the Vampire planet, those vampires had been made aware of their difference in strength.

This was the best option for them, while also protecting themselves if there was an attack, but, of course, there were vampires that disagreed with what was going on. Walking through the marketplace, it was the talk between most of the vampires.

"Have the leaders gone mad? They have sent out a bigger force than what they have left behind. I can't believe they are willing to help those humans to this degree."

"You fool, this is just a testimony to how big the threat is! I mean, you saw those things called the Dalki, right, and at least they are taking the fight to them rather than allow it to happen here again."

"But that also means that we will be open to a counterattack! If they start regarding us as a threat, won't they try to destroy this place again?"

The vampires who had overheard some others talking started to look around. The settlement had vastly changed in a short period of time from what they could all remember. After Quinn had taken over as King, he had made vast improvements to all the castles and even the walls.

"Can they even do anything? The new King had set up so many defences in place. You saw how impressive they were, and I'm sure if they ever attacked us, he would return to defend us. I mean, it was our King himself who asked the leaders to make this decision, they had no choice."

"Yeah, you're right, the King saved us all before, and now he wants to save the humans as well. I'm not worried about winning this war. Us vampires are strong, and the leaders will be able to defeat the Dalki with ease. I'm just annoyed that no one seems to be caring for us."

After the leaders had left planet Daisy, they set out with their forces to help those that needed it. Right now, the Graylash family were on the move and were heading out. Since Owen had defeated the Dalki that had attempted to take over his current planet, they had the easiest time moving to where they wished.

His grandfather, Grim Graylash, had agreed that it was wiser to split up. Unlike the Earthborn group that had split into three, or the Cursed faction that had split into four attacking forces, Owen's side had split into two.

However, there was a reason for this. Rather than concentrate on taking back the planets the Graylash had lost, they were moving like a spear straight ahead. They focused their forces and were going to attack planet after planet as they headed towards the Dalki part of the solar system.

The weaker forces were what had stayed behind, and Owen was confident that even if the Dalki attacked the main Graylash planets, those he had left behind could handle themselves. As such, he was trying to go deep into enemy territory to see just what they had.

Currently, Owen was on one of the Graylash planets. He was just outside a Dalki fortress and the Graylash forces were busy attacking, and by his side, he had one of the vampire leaders with him, the first family leader Nicu Cain.

His arms were folded, and his face showed more than mild annoyance.

"Why aren't you utilising any of the vampire forces? It feels like you are wasting our time here. We could have created our own attack force if you were just going to make us stand by." Nicu complained. "Do you doubt our ability to take on the Dalki forces?"

Owen couldn't help but chuckle.

"I've never underestimated your power for even a second. I know you and your people are strong, but so are ours." Owen replied. "You see, what I plan to do is continue our attack non-stop. Once we take back this planet, We will immediately move onto the next one.

"However, in a fight like this, fatigue is a real thing. At least it is for us humans who have to rely on our bodies and MC cells. We need rest. It's impossible to keep on attacking, and I assume this should also be true for you vampires, even if it might be to a lesser degree.

"Don't worry. After this, we will rest, and you will get plenty of time to show off your skills. I'm looking forward to seeing them. I just hope you won't disappoint me then."

Nicu understood what he was saying, if Owen really planned to continue attacking, they all required rest, including the vampires. A rotation was sensible as they continued to move forward, and even travelling in the spaceships there was no guarantee they were safe.

"Two hours and twenty minutes." Nicu replied. "That's how long it has been since we have attacked this fortress. You hear that!"

The first family members behind stomped the ground in response.

"I will make up for my mistakes, and show you the strength of us vampires. The next fortress we will take out at an even quicker pace than you have done this one."

Looking out far in the fortress, when spotted a one spiked Dalki up in the air. It was then, using his finger, Owen fired out a lightning bolt at the Dalki, hitting it right in the chest, making it fall to the ground.

"I didn't realise you were making this a contest. I guess I should get involved myself then." Owen smiled.

But stopped before running into the battlefield.

"Are you coming, Nate? Or are you on their side?"

Nate punched his shield a couple of times, before running off with Owen. Even though he was a vampire, Nate didn't like Nicu. He also regarded himself more as a human. In the first place, he had been sent over to help the Graylash faction by teaching them how to use Qi.

He was more of a personal teacher to Owen, though, and he would use his own methods to pass this on to the rest.

——

The Cursed faction group led by Sam, as well as Vincent, the tenth leader and tenth family vampires were present. They had just landed on the planet and would be getting ready for battle. Although Sam was getting information on what was happening to everyone so far and their movements.

He would constantly update it, on his model of the Beast solar system, so he could get an idea of what was currently happening.

"Things are going well, but I always feel so nervous when things like this happen."

"That's normal." Vincent replied, looking at the same map. After all, he hasn't made his move yet, and from then on we will have to adapt the plan depending on their actions."

As for who he was referring to, it was naturally Graham, the strongest Dalki leader. As they pushed forward and reclaimed more planets, he was bound to appear at some point. The only question was where and when.

Would it be before they infiltrated the Dalki part of the Beast solar system?

When they finally attacked the base of the Dalki? … or would he get involved even before that?

"Don't worry. All we can do now is keep pushing forward, as for Graham, I know someone who wants to deal with him personally. I hope Quinn is doing okay, and I'm sure, just like always, he will be ready by then, and stronger than ever to kick Graham's lizard head in."

*****

# Chapter 1496 - The Blood Gauntlet's Strength
Before leaving, Sam had made sure to share his plans with Quinn. However, it had not just been one single plan, Sam had informed the Cursed faction leader about his multiple plans depending on how the situation would develop. They had been so detailed, that Quinn had gotten a bit of a headache trying to remember them all.

Still, the large variety had given him confidence that no matter the outcome, Sam had a solution and an answer for any action the Dalki might take. He couldn't imagine anyone else preparing so much, and their enemies would surely be in for a surprise.

Right now, Quinn was on the dark planet that used to be used as the vampire settlement. It was strange to see when arriving at the place that there was no settlement at all. Where it used to be, it was nothing but a paved wasteland now.

It also made him realise just how much of the vampire settlement had been moved over to Daisy as well. The area that had been moved was a little over where the devices had been placed. The technology used was certainly incredible.

'Oh that's right, it wasn't technology, it was some vampire magic right? Whenever I think of magic it reminds me of that God Bliss, she hasn't made an appearance since then either.' Quinn thought.

He was waiting for one of the ships from the fourth family to arrive. Once it did, it would escort him out to where the Nest crystal was discovered. On the way, he would receive updates on the situation.

Quinn didn't mind that much, because it gave him time to do something else. Running through the forest, the Vampire King was looking for a good spot where he could lie low for a while. He went through the trees to give him higher ground and was using his ears to pinpoint the sound of a river.

During his travel through the forest, he had also come up against another ape-like beast with four arms. It stood on the other branch, blocking his view. It reminded Quinn of the ape that they also still kept from the Blade Island.

It had been tamed by Mona and even though she was so far away at times it wasn't hostile to the humans on the Cursed ship. They would often use it to bring and deliver things to the ship, which Quinn found a bit harsh.

However, every time they gave him a banana to 'pay' it for his services, it was visibly over the moon. It seemed happy enough to be of service, in exchange for the tasty treat at least.

However, this ape was clearly blocking his way, and giving Quinn some sort of staring contest. The next second, it started to bang on its chest with all four arms. It vibrated and made a deep hollow sound, showing that it was quite strong.

'Oh, is this a challenge? Maybe I could try something.' Quinn thought.

[Inspect]

[Vorti Ape - Emperor tier beast]

Seeing that it was at the Emperor tier level it was quite strong but killing it would be a waste for him. Instead, he wanted to try something else. Quinn's eyes started to glow red as he looked it in the eye.

'The Charm stat is said to work more on those that have a high level of intelligence, which is why skills like Phantom punch and Influence don't work well on beasts. It might not be a humanoid beast, but since it's an ape it should have at least a decent degree of intelligence, so let's see if this works.'

Staring right into the eyes of the ape, neither of the two broke eye contact, but Quinn could feel it, the ape was getting influenced by his power, despite being at the Emperor tier.

"Take me to a quiet place where I won't be disturbed, you can do that, right?" Quinn asked.

The ape, banged on its right pec once, which Quinn assumed meant 'yes', as seconds later it started to move. While following the ape, he was impressed with how far his powers had come, but after fighting Laxmus, and hearing the tale of how strong Graham was, the vampire knew this wouldn't be enough.

To win this war, there was a chance he would need power on the level similar to when he had combined with Ray's power.

'I don't know what this Nest crystal will do to my system, but I'm hoping it will bring you back, my ancestor.'

The ape was fast as it swung from branch to branch at an incredible speed. It wasn't an Emperor tier beast for nothing. Eventually it stopped upstream by a river and then went up to a large cliff.

Inside the cliff, there looked to be several caves. The ape looked behind it, making sure that the one who had given him the order was still there. When Quinn reached the entrance, it pointed inside.

"So this is the place then, good job…Jesk." Quinn decided to name the ape. "Protect the outside for me, make sure no one or nothing comes inside. You can do that, right?"

The ape responded this time by banging all four of its arms on its body once, and then proceeded to slam the ground under it. It had crushed the floor completely, creating a crater. The beasts on the planet were no joke, which was expected when beings as strong as vampires and Bloodsuckers, along with all the subclasses lived on it.

When entering the cave, he could see that it didn't go very far in, but it was at least void of foreign creatures. That was a good thing because it meant that if anyone or anything did come and try to attack him they would have to do so from the front of the tunnel.

It was then that Quinn sat down and pulled out a flask. Shadow started to rise around his arm, and when it disappeared the black and red gauntlet he would usually have on, had come off, now on the floor.

This was the Blood gauntlet.

Looking at the flask, it was different from the usual one he would carry, which was silver in colour. This one had mainly a red body, and that was because it actually was made with different materials.

When Logan had obtained knowledge of Richard, he had also learned a lot about the vampires and how they created the flasks. In particular, Logan had found out about the strange magic circles that would come to be.

This, with the right set of beast crystals, could create something, and it allowed them to make multiple new flasks with what they had, without relying on the ones the vampires used. In total, Quinn had four of the red flasks on him which were filled with blood, and he also had two silver flasks from the vampires.

Ever since obtaining Arthur's blood armour, though, carrying around flasks and his blood bank was a secondary safety measure. The reason Quinn had pulled out these flasks wasn't for nourishment or anything of that sort.

Instead, he started to pour the flask and blood started to drip on the gauntlet. As it fell it glowed, producing a strange red mist and Quinn could see it was powering up. With his Inspect skill he could see that it had stored the required 10,000 drops of blood. However, he still had three more flasks with him.

After obtaining the special blood gauntlet, Quinn had asked Logan for a favour. To gather the blood from as many people in the shelter as possible. It would take some time, but they had over 50,000 people living at each Shelter, which meant there was plenty of blood that could be used on the gauntlet.

[1,846/20,000 Blood points required]

[The gauntlets active skill can be used three times]

Alas, the requirement of different blood had increased meaning it would be harder each time he used the active skill.

The question was, what equipment would he upgrade?

The first thing Quinn had in mind was his other gauntlet. Using the shadow, the red blood gauntlet was back in his hand, and now his other one was placed on the ground.

'Time for you to upgrade to the Demon tier level.' Quinn thought as he placed his hand on it and activated the blood gauntlet's skill.

*****

# Chapter 1497 - Upgrade Everything
After thinking about it for a while, Quinn decided on what he wanted to upgrade. Given how much he had left, he imagined he would be able to increase the tier of his equipment by around six times in total. Based on how high the blood requirement was going up each time, he used the gauntlet.

This would allow him to use the active skill of the blood gauntlet on all pieces of the Blue Fang armour set.

'The Blue Fang armour set has been one of the best armour sets I've ever used. On top of that, it was gifted to me by her. It would only be right to upgrade the armour set to help me out in this war against the Dalki.'

At the same time, it wasn't as if Quinn had time to go hunting demon tier beasts while everything was going on.

Using the active skill, the white coloured gauntlet started to light up in a red glow as the power was being transferred over. He could feel the gauntlet changing and its shape started to change slightly as well.

It was getting a little thicker in size, while keeping the rest of the gauntlet design intact, and finally when the red glow started to fade. Quinn could see his normal gauntlet in front of him. But it wasn't just the same any more.

'Finally, a Demon tier weapon that I can use.' Quinn thought. The smile was so large on his face, he felt like he could feel the edges of his mouth reaching his eyes.

[You have successfully upgraded the Drainimo Gauntlet into a Demon tier weapon.]

[Energy Sap has been upgraded to Energy Drain]

[When this skill is activated, as long as the gauntlet touches an entity containing energy, that energy will be permanently drained and added to the wearer. Alternatively, this energy can also be used to re-energize the wearer's stamina]

[New active skill learned]

[Energy Share]

[When this skill is activated, as long as the gauntlet touches an entity, it will permanently take energy from the user and share it.]

[+ 80 Strength]

[+ 10 Agility]

[+ 10 Stamina]

Looking at the active skills, it was better than he thought. Not only did he get a boost in stats compared to when it had been at the Demi-god tier level, but the effects of the active skill had changed.

Before, the active skill would allow him to absorb energy from others, but that energy would only temporarily stay with him. Here, the change in text was subtle, but it stated the words permanent.

'It reminds of the skill that Ray told me he had…this gauntlet, it now can weaken the others while increasing my own strength as well. I just have to be careful about one thing. How much energy my body can hold from those I take.

'If I were to use it on every creature I come across, taking in their energy and my body was at its limit. Then I would no longer be able to use this active skill to weaken my enemy during the fight. There is a chance it could strain my current body.'

Quinn knew that his body was already holding in a large amount of Qi and Blood energy and although this skill was good, it could do more harm than good if he didn't keep his own limit in mind. He had seen the negative effects of such a thing happen with Agent 2.

'Luckily, this new Energy share skill, seems to be the perfect solution to the problem. I can give energy to others. I wonder if the energy given to others is permanent as well. If so, it might be an easy way to increase the power of everyone's Qi without having them train.'

Thinking about this active skill, it reminded Quinn of the dry bodies he had seen. Perhaps this was somewhat similar to what Pure had been doing in those secret labs.

With the one upgrade done, Quinn decided to follow up with the Blue Fang set. He was a little worried that upgrading just one part of the set would make it, so the active set skill might no longer work. He could only hope that as long as all the pieces were upgraded, that it would ensure he could keep using it.

Quinn began with the chest piece, and continued on the rest. As predicted, the rest of the flasks were enough for him to use the active skill a few more times and now, his whole armour set had been upgraded to the next tier.

The thing was, if Quinn wanted to use the gauntlet's active skill again, he now would have to gather 80,000 different blood types, and he was unable to use the ones that he had already used. The amount had jumped far more than he had predicted, as it didn't seem to follow a set pattern like Quinn first thought.

'It looks like it's going to be a long time until I can use that skill again, but I can't be down.'

[Demi-god Blue Fang chest piece]

[Demi-god Blue Fang shoulder guard]

[Demi-god Blue Fang leg piece]

[Demi-god Blue Fang boots]

All the pieces had gone from Legendary tier to Demi-god tier, and without a doubt Quinn thought he had to have one of the best beast armour sets now out in existence.

Before, the Blue Fang set had blessed Quinn with a total of 90 extra Agility points, and that was without using its active skill. Now all pieces increased it by 120. Although the improvement didn't seem big for getting all pieces onto the Demi-god tier level.

This meant, if someone wore a complete set of Demi-god tier equipment, they would be faster than Quinn without any beast gear on. For once, Quinn was happy that beast gear wasn't able to be used on the Dalki, and that obtaining such high level equipment was rare.

The important thing that Quinn wanted to see a change in though was the active skill.

Looking at it, Quinn was glad to see that Nitro Acceleration was still there. The only disappointing thing was that it had not changed either.

In the past, using Nitro Acceleration would bring his agility up to 220, now with the increased stats and his system being fully uncooked giving him more speed his speed would reach around 280. Making him three times as fast as if he didn't have equipment on.

He doubted that there would be anyone faster than him, and with this speed and his strikes he was sure he could do some serious damage. The two-minute usage time was the only small downside to the whole thing.

'Huh, wait…there's no new active skill… Was the Gauntlet just a lucky coincidence? Do I only gain an extra skill when something reaches Demon tier?' Quinn thought, and now wondered if should have kept the upgrades for something else. Still, it was an improvement nonetheless.

Placing the Blue Fang set on him, and using the Blood gauntlet and now the Demon tier gauntlet on himself. He felt it was time to leave the cave. During his little upgrade spell, he could tell that there was some fighting going on outside.

Exiting the cave, Quinn could see Jesk was badly hurt. The gorilla now had cuts all over his body, and it looked like he was going up against another gorilla of the same species. It had grey fur and four limbs but was larger.

It was clear this beast had come along more than the one that Quinn had controlled. Seeing Quinn, Jesk immediately went by his side and started to beat his chest again. Even though he was covered in wounds, it looked like it was determined to continue following Quinn's order.

'I could kill that beast myself… but I'm sure you would prefer your own payback. It would be rude of me not to reward your loyalty.' Quinn ran behind the other gorilla, and held it by the back of its head. At that moment, he started to use the effects of the Energy drain on his gauntlet.

The grey gorilla attempted to hit Quinn, and honestly he let it hit him with his hands as it did next to nothing. Absorbing some energy from the newly arrived gorilla, Quinn quickly went back, and touched Jesk on top of the head.

[Energy Share]

'Let's see how much energy you get from this thing…and maybe me and you, Jesk, can be friends for a while longer on this trip.'

Jesk started to grow a little larger and its muscles were starting to budge. Its wounds looked to be ignored, while the one opposite felt a little sluggish after being drained. At the same time, in the air, Quinn could see that the ship had arrived to take him to where he needed to be.

"Go Jesk, I chose you! show him what you got." Quinn smiled.

# Chapter 1498 - Without An Ability
Standing towards the cave entrance, Quinn was observing Jesk, after the gorilla received the power boost from the gauntlet. It was a great way to test the new active skills and how they worked.

'Since there Is no way or hint to evolving my body, I always just left that Quest alone, but after feeling Ray's power. I know it's possible to still change, so there must be a way.' Quinn thought, as he had felt a strain when he had absorbed the grey gorilla's power, which had only disappeared after he had shared it with Jesk.

'Once I find a way to complete that Quest and become something beyond a Vampire Lord, then I should be able to use this Demon tier gauntlet to its full potential.'

A big clash occurred in the centre as the two gorillas locked into each other. Quinn could see eight hands tied up, both beasts were attempting to overpower the other. Unsurprisingly, with Jesk's new-found strength and with the grey gorilla weakened, the former was able to continue pushing the intruder back.

The ground was being torn as the gorilla was being pushed, and eventually its back slammed against a tree. With its bottom two arms, Jesk had let go of the grip he had on the gorilla, while still holding its other two arms at the top and keeping it in place. It then knocked the hands away before using its lower arms to continuously punch the gorilla in the stomach one after the other.

"HOO! HOO!" Jesk bellowed while it continued to punch the one that had hurt him. The grey gorilla was bleeding from its mouth, and to finish it off, Jesk lifted the other gorilla over its shoulder and slammed it on the ground.

'I took around a quarter of the energy away from the other Emperor tier and added it to Jesk, it seems that the experiment was a success.' Quinn thought, a satisfied smile on his face.

However, he was baffled as to what happened next. Jesk had clearly won the fight, but he now stood over the other gorilla and then punched at its chest once again, this time piercing through it with its bare hands and sheer strength. Quinn thought it was simply finishing off its opponent at first, but he soon saw that the gorilla had pulled out the other's beast crystal.

'Wait is it?'

A few seconds later, the gorilla was already consuming the crystal raw. Seeing this, Quinn was reminded of the actions of the humanoid beasts, whose bodies were currently inhabited by Vorden and Raten.

It was a natural way for beasts to evolve, only that it was rare to see them do it. Quinn could have easily gone and stopped Jesk before the gorilla ate the crystal, yet it would have been rude. One Emperor tier crystal would not have made much of a difference for the war, while the gorilla might benefit a lot more from it.

As if to prove Quinn's thought process, Jesk was beginning to evolve at the same time. The vampire wasn't sure if Jesk had already been close to an evolution, if it was due to him absorbing a compatible beast crystal, after all, they were both gorillas of the same species, or if he had stumbled upon a secret extra benefit from his Energy Share ability.

'They can wait just a little while.' Quinn thought, as he noticed the ship land on the planet.

The gorilla looked to be in pain. Unlike the humanoid tier beasts, it looked like it didn't know when it evolved that it would be in a vulnerable state. It was easy for any beasts to come and kill it. Since Jesk had done a good job in defending the cave, Quinn thought he could at least defend it from any others that would try to attack him.

The strange thing was, while Quinn waited, he could tell that other beasts were heading their way, making him wonder if evolving beasts were giving off some type of energy that served as a beacon. His eyes started to glow red, and Quinn stomped his foot on the ground, sending a bit of his Qi force out towards the forest area. After the initial second, where everyone had frozen in place, they had all runoff in the opposite direction.

It was clear who would win in a fight, and the beasts seemed to know it as well. Eventually, Jesk's evolution was complete. He was now a white furred gorilla with six arms, the new ones had come out from his sides. The third pair were a little smaller, but his body had grown in size to the point where Jesk was now as big as a Dalki.

"Congratulations on becoming a Legendary tier beast now, you look strong." Quinn said.

The gorilla beast was only a few metres away and Quinn noticed one thing, his Influence skill was weakening on the beast now that it had evolved. Not because its intelligence had decreased, but just because it was harder to control such beasts at this level.

In the end, Quinn had already gotten his use out of Jesk, so he decided to let the beast go. When doing so, Quinn had half expected the gorilla to attempt to kill him straight away. Instead, Jesk put his six knuckles to the ground and bowed its head.

'Is he kneeling?' Quinn thought. "Are you thanking me?"

The gorilla lifted its head and started to nod. It was now in debt to the person who not only saved his life but had managed to help him grow to this state.

'Did I just tame a beast without an ability? I guess I shouldn't be too surprised. The humanoid beasts before could also be reasoned with. I guess it's just the lower tier beasts and the unintelligent ones that are aggressive.'

"I will be leaving this place, Jesk." Quinn spoke, not sure if the monkey could fully understand him or not, so the vampire did some actions with his fingers as well. "I hope you do well and continue to grow strong."

Turning around, Quinn felt like it was his time to leave, he needed to get going after all. At the same time, he wanted to try out how much faster he was without using the Nitro Accelerate skill. He had to get used to the speed, so he could use it in the fight.

Walking a few steps, Quinn then suddenly ran through the forest. He was careful to avoid the trees, and it was good training for him. He needed to focus with his speed. The difference didn't seem too great for Quinn to deal with, but he knew that this was just a taste, because when Nitro Accelerate was used, that was when the real trouble would start.

A couple of minutes later, Quinn arrived at the empty wasteland, where he could see a medium-sized battleship had landed. Outside, already waiting, seemed to be his escort group. There were four people, and they looked to be on guard until Quinn slowed down his stride.

"Your Majesty!" They all stated as they lowered their heads, soon lifting them again.

"Sorry for making you wait, I hope you weren't too worried." Quinn replied.

"Of course, we just landed ourselves. We weren't waiting at all. I am Earl Ronsten of the fourth family, and I am in charge of this expedition. I will do my best to assist you, Your Majesty, and shall inform you to the best of my abilities wherever possible.

"The two by my side are Viscount Norvic and Viscount Nian. We are all inner castle vampires."

Since Ronsten didn't bother to introduce the other one, Quinn could only assume they were low ranking vampires. Titles such as Earl and Viscount were only given to those from the castles, but Quinn had never bothered with any of that stuff, and it seemed like that was a trait shared by those from the tenth family, since no one had informed him of any such thing when he became leader.

Essentially, the Earl was the captain of the group, and the two by his side were similar to platoon leaders of the group. Ronsten, looked to be quite the young adult around twenty-five and had spiked hair that suited this era's hairstyle. Which was a bit unusual for the vampires. Still, Quinn knew not to judge vampires by their appearances.

Then there was Nian, a female who had her hair in a single potty tail and sharp eyes. Her expression hadn't changed once since Quinn had arrived. He had seen plenty of her type among the vampires, then finally there was the Viscount Norvic, who had quite the large belly and looked a bit older. It was the first time Quinn really had seen a vampire with what people often referred to as a beer belly.

"Let's get going, and you can explain to me on the way, why you are having trouble procuring the Nest Crystal." Quinn ordered. As they were about to move, they all heard something come from the forest as tree branches were heard breaking. All three moved in front of the King, getting their hands ready to protect him.

A few seconds later, a large white furred beast with six arms could be seen coming through.

"Everyone, stand back." Quinn ordered, stepping forward. "He's a friend. I guess that means you wish to come along with me, Jesk?"

# Chapter 1499 - A Unique Beast
The medium-sized vessel was on its way to its destination, it was a place that the vampires had only just left and were now returning again. On board the medium-sized ship, Quinn was trying to get a gauge of what their current forces were like.

There were the four that had greeted him, then a total of ten more vampires on board, it looked like. The vessel looked as if it could house around a 100 or so staff, and was far too big for the likes of them.

However, Quinn never expected a big expedition team in the first place, especially since only one family leader had been selected and most of them were out in the front lines fighting. At the moment, Quinn was in a meeting with the two viscounts and the Earl, although they had one more unexpected guest which was Jesk, who had refused to stop following Quinn.

Honestly, Quinn felt safe with him by his side, His loyalty seemed unwavering and was perhaps more trustworthy than the humans and vampires.

——

While the meeting was taking place, that left the rest of the crew to relax for the time being. They were currently in one of the break rooms, which had juice packs of blood for them and a kitchen in case they wanted to cook any meat. There was also a large rectangular table for them all to sit on and eat, which some of them were doing now.

"So what do you think about our new King, it was the first time we have seen him up close." The one speaking was named Moe and was sitting at the table. Most of those that were brought along from the trip other than those that were in the meeting currently were from the inner castle area of the fourth family.

"He seemed, I don't know, plain?" Joy, the small framed vampire that was currently drinking from a small blood pack, replied. "I mean, sometimes it's hard to believe that the guy out there was the guy that saved all the settlement, and our king no less."

"But he did save the settlement!" Rick suddenly spoke up from the side. A larger vampire that was sleeveless showing the side of his muscles. He had just finished grabbing a raw steak and placed it out on the table and sat opposite to the others. "Not just once, but he saved it twice."

Everyone was interested in this conversation. Being in different families meant they didn't have much chance to interact with the king. They had only seen him in action a few times and for them it was strange. Because news before he had been elected a lot of different families were telling them to be cautious of the tenth leader. Suddenly, the leaders were changing their tune which just left the rest confused.

"We know." Moe rolled his eyes. "We were all there, but you know the rumours being spread around, right? That it was borrowed power. That Arthur had given him his strength, and he had obtained something after that as well. Some vampires think that if it wasn't for the previous Kings' Absolute Blood Control that he would no longer be as strong as he was, and you know he can't use the blood control much either, right? Because of the strain it puts on one's body.

"So we're just questioning how strong he really is now."

"I heard the same thing." Joy said, nodding her head a long.

Although Rick didn't agree, it was the same for him, he had heard the same rumours.

"Whether what you say is true or not, that man is our king, He saved our lives twice, and he might be the one that saved our lives on this trip as well."

"Speaking about that!" Joy said, as she had just finished her juice pack and gave off a refreshing 'Ah' Sound. "What do you think he will do against them? I mean, we all struggled, we could see the crystal, but we couldn't even get close to it. I think maybe just with the King here it won't be enough."

"I agree." Another said who was listening in on the conversation so far. "The other leaders should have come for this. A variety of strength is what we need, not a single strength. I think…this might be even too much for our king as well."

There was silence between the others as they remembered what had happened on their quest. Some of them even felt ashamed.

"You know what I'm worried about." Moe broke the silence. "It's Norvic, I heard he dislikes the King. Although he is in the fourth family he supports the red side's ideal. So he isn't exactly too pleased with him. Maybe he will say something or do something that angers the king? I guess then it would show if he really is strong or not."

———

The meeting was taking place in the control room. In this room, one could see the front of the ship and the space outside in front of them. It looked like the vampires had crafted a special seat on the ship just for Quinn, and he could see it was something that had newly been implemented.

"Please, sit sir." Earl Ronsten gestured towards the seat.

"And all of you are going to stand?" Quinn replied, finding the whole thing awkward. "Don't worry, I appreciate the gesture and I have two working legs just fine. So about this Nest Crystal that you found. I'm guessing you had some difficulties, if you could please explain."

The second, Quinn asked this question, Viscount Norvic just scoffed. It was unclear if it was at the remark Quinn had made or an accident, but the other Viscount next to him, Nian, gave him a stare that would cause most people to back away.

"Discovering the crystal was not the problem, and honestly, most of the beasts that were on the planet were easy to defeat. However, as we got closer to the Nest Crystal, there was something strange that happened." Ronsten explained.

"The beasts near the area were getting stranger, and then we could finally see it, trouble that faced us all. Even with our abilities and strength, this task seemed like an impossible one without any of the leaders' help."

"Yes, and it still seems impossible." Norvic replied. "But there was one that was insistent in us finding the Nest Crystal and bringing them back to them straight away. So we went ahead anyway, despite knowing the dangers and came out far more hurt."

"Norvic, please, the king has his own reasons for wanting the Nest Crystal!" Ronsten shouted.

"And what is that?" Norvic replied. "Please tell us while everyone is off fighting including the leaders that this crystal is so important, and why we couldn't just continue searching rather than be sent on this death quest."

It looked like finally Nian was going to step in as she stood infant of Norvic and looked at him, but Quinn instead cleared his throat.

"I understand your worry, you just care for your family vampires and that is a good trait to have. I like that." Quinn replied. "But it would be best if you tell everything you know, so we are prepared, and more importantly, I can protect you all."

There was silence from the others in the room, until Ronson eventually started speaking again.

"The beasts we were fighting, the reason they felt a little off was because they were special beasts being produced by the Nest Crystal and protecting them. Beasts that we call, doppelganger. We don't know what tier they are at, but whoever the beast faced it was able to copy the opponent in front of them, and equal them in strength. It was something that seemed impossible, but none of us could defeat ourselves. Everyone was even in battle.

"Which is why, we are worried that even with your help, if they can truly copy anyone's strength including yours, we will still be unable to complete this task."
