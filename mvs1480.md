# Chapter 1480 - Lightning Qi
It was a solution that Quinn thought only Leo could come up with. During his time in school, Quinn had taught Qi to many, and Leo would be using a similar method to what he had done to guide others.

In the first place, Quinn just took what he had learned from Leo and applied it to others and a little bit from Chris as well.

But there was one problem. When Quinn used to teach Qi to those at school, even for the geniuses, it would take them some time, and right now, they lacked time the most.

There was no way they could wait a few days for it to click in Owen's head, nor was he sure they could all even stay here that long.

'Can Leo teach him how to use Qi so fast and at this moment?' Quinn considered.

First, though, Owen would have to accept learning it in the first place.

"Qi… I believe it's a strange power that you explained which is naturally present in our bodies and is also the reason behind my selection to be part of this group. It is also the same strange power that Pure used too, correct?" Owen asked.

They had all seen the power of Qi being displayed a number of times, and there was a great number of those in the Cursed faction that already knew how to use it.

They just had never made it public due to the misunderstanding it might cause. At the time, the Cursed faction wasn't in the best light, and people would have forced connections to the Cursed faction and Pure.

Leo nodded to the question.

"You have the talent to learn it well. Of course, just like everything, it will take time for you to master it, but it will increase your strength greatly while not affecting any of your current powers. However, I will only be able to guide you a little at this moment; the rest will be up to you."

There was one person who was somewhat sulking upon hearing this. Leo had offered to help Owen yet hadn't offered to help Abdul. The latter felt like it was unfair.

"Owen is our last hope now," Sunny said as she could read the expression on his face. "We wanted this to be fair competition, and truthfully, we thought that all of you were qualified, but at the end of the day, the king is the one to decide.

"If that is the case, now with only one person left, we have to try our best to make him succeed."

Understanding the explanation, Abdul just crossed his arms and was just happy that the others didn't get help, even though he was unaware that the other two had also used Qi.

Owen agreed and sat down on the ground with Leo standing behind him. The latter was getting ready to place his hands on his shoulders. Seeing this, Quinn was a little afraid because Leo had attempted to teach Qi to Quinn, and that was how he was turned and was worried that the same thing could happen to Owen at this moment.

However, Quinn had taught others Qi without turning them, using Leo's same method now. Since Leo was better at controlling Qi, even more so than him, Quinn had to trust him.

With his ability, Leo was more in tune with the energy that was actually following inside of Owen. He could describe to him in great detail what was happening. He could also adjust and tell if the other person was doing something wrong because, as silly as it may sound, Leo could see what the other person was doing.

Whereas when Quinn would do this, he had no choice but to guess what the other was doing. Time slowly passed, and about fifteen minutes later, it seemed like Leo was finally done with his job.

Stepping away and walking off to the side, Leo stood not too far from Owen.

It felt surreal, Quinn wasn't sure if Owen really could activate Qi at this moment, but if he had another breakthrough similar to what Samantha had, perhaps he could do it.

That's when Quinn noticed something. Leo looked quite exhausted and was staring in Layla's direction.

'Have these guys…planned something?' Quinn narrowed his eyes.

Standing back just like Layla, Owen moved away. Although she had failed, Layla knew that this was important to them all. Seeing how sturdy the shell was, they needed this king on their side.

With her ability, she was now doing something unique to her and was slowly transferring her own Qi energy into him, and at the same time, Leo had activated his soul weapon.

Owen had learned a lot; he was a fast learner, which surprised even Leo. They didn't call him the genius of the Graylash family for no reason. Still, it wasn't enough time for him to learn how to use it properly. So with his soul weapon, he would help draw that aura and the energy within Owen out of him into his fist.

While standing in the centre of the room, Owen activated his lightning powers but only around his legs. It spiralled blue sparks from his foot up to his knees, as he then stood in a sprinting position as if he was ready to set off at any second.

It was showy, but there was a reason for it. He could tell that this energy within his body wasn't his own, and Owen hoped that they also gave power to his legs. After all, speed was an important factor when making one's punch as strong as possible.

He threw down his usual metal fan into the ground, rendering it to stick upright, and then focused on his right hand, which now seemed to be covered in blue light; unlike his legs, this seemed steady. It was practically glowing so much that the hand seemed to be made of pure light.

"Go!" Owen shouted.

He ran forward, a deep scorch mark left behind by his feet, with every step. Then after a couple of steps, bending his knees, he jumped up in the air and started to spin his body. It was one of his most classic moves but adjusted a little for the test as he held out one of his hands.

Spinning in the air, Owen's body shot out like a lightning bolt and crashed headfirst into the shell with his fist firmly planted on it. His body was upright as it hit the shell, and the two forces collided.

The purple sparks that would usually come from the shell when the others would use Qi went off once again, and this time, they were more fierce than ever before, as if they were trying to attack the person in front of it.

"You shouldn't have let me go last. I know about this already." Owen said.

As the purple sparks flew up at Owen's arms, Layla became worried. They couldn't affect Samantha that much because her attack wasn't too strong, but if Layla hadn't used the second stage of Qi to protect her arm, she could only imagine what the purple sparks could do.

Before it could reach Owen's arm, though, his own blue lightning sparks from his glowing arms would attack whatever went close. It looked like a battle between two lightning powers, blue and purple.

As they hit each other, they were getting wilder and wilder, but both Layla and Leo continued to use their powers before the two of them had fallen to their knees. They had done all they could, and now they needed to rest.

Fortunately, Genbu was so mesmerised by the scene that he failed to see both of them falling to the ground. Otherwise, for sure, he would have noticed that something was strange.

Finally, the purple sparks slowly disappeared, and only the blue ones remained.

A shockwave was sent into the mountain from behind, and Owen fell to the ground, now on one knee, his knuckles no longer were on the shell. The sleeve covering his arm had burnt into nothingness, but he didn't care and looked up to see the result.

*****

# Chapter 1481 - Unbreakable Shell
Everyone could tell that the attempt made by Owen was the best attempt out of all of them so far, whether it was because of the help he received from the others, the small training he had done with Leo, or the fact that Owen had actually tried, it was hard to tell, but they were waiting to see the result in anticipation.

If Owen hadn't succeeded in impressing the turtle, then they would have to quickly come up with another way to convince the king, maybe even fight and force him to form a contract with one of them.

With all of them there, they thought it would be an easy thing to do. The only problem was how the other familiar would feel about this.

From the outside, the effect of Owen's punch wasn't entirely obvious; for one, the shell was still in one piece. Perhaps it would crack soon after, but it never did, which proved just how strong the shell was. When Owen's arm fell, some of them were able to see. Once again, Genbu started to move, and he scuffled across the ground quickly in excitement.

His large head blocked the view of the shell from the others.

"My word, I must say, you…you actually…you actually managed to damage it!"

He certainly sounded pleased with the result, but the others were still amazed. It was clear the words that Genbu had spoken; he claimed that the shell had been damaged but not destroyed.

When moving his head out of the way, the others could see that a single scale on the shell, where Owen had put all his strength, had been cracked. However, the crack itself didn't ripple out to the adjacent scales, and even the base of the shell was mostly intact.

Genbu even turned the shell around, and the crack hadn't gone to the other half on the back either.

"I hope this is enough." Sunny mumbled quietly under her breath. Even the other two kings that were present weren't so sure, and they were ready to help all the others if need be to subdue Genbu.

Genbu's face was straight, showing no emotion, unlike his voice earlier, and he had his eyes closed.

"This one is talented…this one is very talented. If he can destroy one of my shells to this degree, then without a doubt, I feel he can hurt almost anyone out there. If one with the strongest defence teams up with one with the strongest attack, then the two will make a powerful combo. Far more powerful than any of the other kings." Genbu smiled.

"Does this mean you are willing to form a contract?" Sunny asked hesitantly.

To this, Genbu nodded, and the others inwardly cheered without giving too much away. They had succeeded in their task, and one more familiar, an extremely useful one, would be a part of the team.

Abdul, Layla, and even Samantha were honestly a little disheartened that they could not get the familiar. Each of them had their reasons for wanting the king on their side. Especially after witnessing how strong its outer shell was, they wanted it more, and if they were truthful, they felt like the person that needed it least was Owen.

He was already more powerful than them all, but in the end, this was what happened; those who were strong would get even stronger.

Genbu had come to Owen and was now looking him up and down. The turtle couldn't stop complimenting him about his body and features, and his attitude towards Owen had taken a full one-eighty degree turn.

Meanwhile, Quinn stood near Layla, "You did a good job, Layla."

"I honestly believe that you had the best chance out of all of them, and you actually would have produced the best result as well. However, you are selfless. Honestly, I don't think the others would have done what you did.

"I know you gave some of your power to help out Owen, and you thought about the benefit of all of us rather than your own. Who knows, the turtle might have been bluffing it and would have just contracted that with the best result, and I think you knew this as well before making your decision."

Quinn was right. Layla had thought about that before helping out Owen, but the truth was she wasn't the selfless one; she actually didn't wish to help. Leo was the one that had approached her in the end. She knew Quinn was just trying to cheer her up, but now, how could she tell him the truth?

While Quinn was talking to her, the contract process began on the other side. As Genbu pressed his head against Owen's, he shrunk in size by a little and was now at the same height as Owen.

Frankly, it seemed like Owen was being quite respectful to the turtle. Perhaps after discovering how hard its shell was, he realised how much value a familiar had. After a few moments passed, Genbu started to turn into a strong purple mist and then zapping itself like a large particle of energy, a purple lightning bolt appeared on the palm of Owen's hand.

The turtle had disappeared, and it looked like the contract was a success. Soon though, the lighting bolt lit up, and Genbu was back in front of everyone.

"How do you like the symbol? Your lightning powers from before inspired me." Genbu stated. "The contract is completed. Unlike others, I only have one desire: to look after all of those in my territory. I wish to protect them and feed them with energy, so you need to stay alive as long as you can."

"I don't plan on dying so soon, and I wish that you can help me stay alive," Owen asked as well.

The group was soon ready to leave the mountain. They couldn't stay here too much longer and needed to head back to the exact location where they had first entered so the Boneclaw could take them back to their world.

Now that there was no war going on, Dunluck could call upon his allies and allow them a quick return. Still, before leaving, Quinn couldn't help but look at one of the many shells that were still left in great shape by the others since no one had touched them.

"Once a contract has been formed, there's no way to cancel a contract, right? Not unless you kill the host?" Quinn asked, walking up to one of the shells.

"Correct," Genbu said, nodding his head.

"Well, if that's the case," Quinn replied as he readied himself.

He stood there in front of one of the intact turtle shells and readied his fist. The Qi soon collected in front of him. The shadow rose and switched from his blood king armour set to the Blue fang.

[Nitro accelerate activated]

Qi of the second stage slowly wrapped around his hand, and he was so close to the shell that sparks were flying from it before he had even touched it.

Seeing this, Sunny couldn't help but giggle.

"I guess those comments got to you more than we thought."

Blood aura started to form around Quinn's hand, and with his blood control, he spun it as fast as possible. Ready, Quinn then ran back to the centre of the room. He was so fast that the others had only blinked, and he was in the centre.

Then running back, the ground beneath his feet formed a crater as he jumped up, and he threw the blood drill, infused with Qi into the shell with the power of his Nitro accelerated speed.

The purple sparks couldn't do anything as the attack slammed into the shell, cracking it instantly. The powers didn't collide like the others. The shell was smashed to pieces, with it flying everywhere, and the momentum of the attack continued as it hit the mountain wall behind it.

The whole room shook until the energy finally disappeared, and once everything calmed down, they saw Quinn standing, with no shell left in front of him.

"Ahh, now that was satisfying," Quinn said, turning around and smiling at the others.

*****

# Chapter 1482 - The Reason You Were Picked
While walking back to the others, Quinn's steps suddenly came to a halt and turned around, only to see a giant cavity in the side of the mountain. He didn't know what had come over him at that moment.

Maybe, it was the fact that he wanted to test out his strength, or this was a challenge that no one seemed to pass, and he wanted to accomplish. Perhaps it was the turtle's bickering, but being able to destroy a shell like that felt extremely satisfying. However, he realised that it had come at the cost of hurting the world, and now he felt quite bad that he let these strange emotions get the better of him.

"I'm sorry, if I can give some of my energy to help restore this world, I'll fix the mountain," Quinn said, rubbing the back of his head out of embarrassment.

None of them replied because they all stood still with their mouths open at what they had just seen. The shell was, without a doubt, very tough. None of them could deny that, so how on earth did Quinn manage to break it?

"Bhahahaha." Owen let out a hollow laugh, "After all our hard work just damaging one scale, you go and do that. You really are one of a kind."

The cat looked furious, Quinn never thought he had seen a vein on a cat before, but it seemed like it was possible because there was one bulging through the side of the cat head beyond the fur, which honestly had Quinn quite worried.

"I'll speak to Bony or something about it. I'm sorry." Quinn said once again.

Although most had gotten over the initial shock, there was one among them who still had his jaw left wide open, literally.

The turtle Genbu still couldn't believe it even after Sunny walked towards him and waved her hand in front of its face.

Eventually, though, as Quinn got closer, the turtle snapped out of it, slamming its mouth shut.

"You tricked me! You all tricked me! This little bug wasn't weak at all. He had great strength, why would you, and how…how? No one has ever broken my shell!"

"I deeply apologise." Sunny immediately said, seeing how the situation could perhaps get rough, and at the end of the day, she had to cover for her king. "You see, he is a little special. He is not just any vampire but the king of vampires, which is why he has great strength.

"We were afraid that if you saw his strength, you might wish to find someone that would match up to him, but you should know that your shell is one of the strongest things in existence, and there could rarely be anyone who could match up to its sturdiness."

"Apart from someone like him," Genbu complained and was staring at Quinn with his intense eyes. Thinking about it more, Genbu knew the real strength of his shell. In the first place, he actually hadn't expected even one of them to activate the purple sparks, and if he was honest, even the first human, the girl, who had taken this test, had passed in his eyes.

He had greatly underestimated them all, which was why he had decided to change his tune after the first one to take the test.

"I have already signed a contract, I can't go back, but I just don't like how you made me a fool," Genbu said, walking away. He started to remember all the times he called Quinn weak, and recalling those words, he couldn't help but his feet stomp the ground in embarrassment.

The group soon moved. The mountain began to repair itself as they made their way out from it. The group found it strange; it was as if the familiars themselves were in control of when they would use energy to repair the world, or perhaps the world was aware of what was going on and decided to act once they were done.

Either way, the group waited for the horses to enter the area, which didn't take long. This time there were enough for everyone, allowing for each of them to ride their individual horse as they made their way back.

Genbu, who could change its size, had become so small that he could be easily held in Owen's palm and decided to stay on top of his contractor's head, similar to how Ovin would sit on Leo's head.

"I'm not used to being in that space, and I prefer the outdoors, so keep me out for as long as possible. Although I will need to rest from time to time." Genbu claimed.

While riding, Quinn noticed that he was getting looks from a few people. Genbu, for one, still seemed to be upset over the whole thing. Then there was Abdul as well.

'That strength… he didn't display that in the game. Wait, didn't they say something like he wasn't the one who fought? He was that strange dragon-looking thing, right? But even then, his strength is far beyond what I suspected.

'I wonder if he and Sera fought with their full strength, who would win.' Abdul thought.

"I still can't believe it," Genbu repeated as they continued to go through the land. "Even if I can't sense energy, I can't believe you people tricked me just like that. Hey kid, your familiar is the Undead king, correct? He certainly picked a good one."

For some reason, upon hearing the turtle's words, Quinn felt like he needed to correct the turtle.

"Although the Undead king picked me, I didn't have this strength when we made the contract, and I was actually weaker than anyone here at the time. I still don't understand why he picked me."

"The Undead king, I have known him for a while, a lot longer than the other two," Genbu replied. "He had been in this land for a long-time, and just like myself, he was someone who never left or formed a contract with anyone.

"He took his duty in culling those familiars more seriously than anyone, and if there were any disputes between those in his area, he would be the first one to solve it, which is why I was more surprised than anyone to learn when he had contracted someone. However, there was a rumour that he hadn't returned even though his contract had broken.

"Honestly, it's been a long time since he and I have spoken to each other. I would also like to know how he made up his mind to contract, which person he contracted with and why. All familiars have a desire, a craving, and it's similar to a life goal, which words can't explain so well.

"Perhaps it's something similar to humans believing they have a purpose. Energy is just what we need to live and for our world to continue, but the desire is something else. What I am trying to say is, that you must have something that is fulfilling his desire, or at least he thought you would satisfy it somewhat."

It was a question that had been on Quinn's mind since he had been here, and it would have been a lot easier if the Boneclaw would just answer him.

…

Eventually, the group returned to the spot, and the whole mission was a success. Layla and Leo were the most exhausted from this adventure, and it looked like they might need a couple of days rest before they returned to action.

To their surprise, the Boneclaw was already waiting for them in the exact spot. For how long, who knew.

After getting off the horses and saying goodbye, Quinn first walked up to the Boneclaw and looked up to him.

"I guess you did what you needed to do?" Quinn asked, to which the Boneclaw just nodded. At least it looked like he nodded. Quinn was hoping that the Boneclaw would tell him what he had done, but his familiar hadn't been open to him for this long, and it looked like it would take some more time before he relaxed himself a bit more.

When Genbu and Boneclaw looked at each other, the two of them didn't say anything. It looked like Genbu wanted to say some words, but in the end, he just smiled, and everyone continued on their way. The teleporter opened, and the group found themselves back in the room they had left before.

"Everyone is here, right; no one is missing?" Quinn asked.

Everyone answered, and the Boneclaw disappeared, forming a simple mark on Quinn's back. Ovin did the same along with the horse, while the only one that chose to remain outside was Genbu. He had never seen what the actual human world looked like and was quite curious.

"Quinn," Chucky called, standing in front of them, leaning up against the wall, and it looked like he had been waiting for the group for a while now. "You weren't gone as long as I thought you would be; well, Sam would be glad to hear that.

"I have some news for you. The vampire soldiers, along with Ashley, have arrived, but before you greet them, Sam told me to tell you, Hayley is with them, and she wishes to speak to you."

It was a conversation that Quinn wasn't looking forward to, and behind him was another female who wanted to talk to him as well.

*****

# Chapter 1483 - A Request Of Tears
After everyone's return, they felt a lot better. Rather than their energy being sapped away from them, now they could feel it slowly returning. Only now did they truly feel how much effect the world was having on them.

In the same way, it was the opposite for the familiars, and Genbu understood why the other familiars decided not to stay out for so long.

Quinn told everyone that he would call and meet up with everyone later. First, they should all get some rest, and he knew they needed it, though there were a few who were worried about Owen.

In fact, for the first time, even Owen looked to be a bit tired. Before leaving for the rooms, he first went towards Leo.

"I wanted to ask, the power that you taught me earlier. I don't want to pry, but if possible, can I teach it to those in the Graylash family?" Owen asked. "I feel like I was a bit foolish in the past, wishing for everyone to learn the lighting power thinking it was the strongest, and although I still somewhat believe that, and it would solve the inequality problem, it wouldn't solve it completely.

"It is impossible to have everyone on equal footing, but before even thinking about that, we need to win this war, so we need all the power we can get. However, I assume that this power of Qi is something similar to an Original ability. If you do not wish for me to pass this on, I will respect your decisions."

Knowing that Quinn would have overheard everything, Leo looked over. Yet, it felt strange for him to do something like that. Qi was never something Quinn thought was his own to teach others, and he always felt like it belonged to Leo.

However, Quinn did agree with what Owen said about its power, which was also why many in the Cursed faction were learning it.

"You may pass on what you know, but unfortunately, I don't have the time to teach you," Leo replied.

"I'll send someone," Quinn said after hearing that answer. "A few people in the Cursed faction know how to use Qi. I'll send someone to join the Graylash faction and teach it. You're right that you guys need to get stronger."

There was another reason why Quinn was holding back teaching it to the other groups, and that was because Qi was somewhat a weakness for vampires. Especially now that Quinn was king, he also needed to look out for the vampires.

However, if they didn't win this war, what vampires would he have to look after. No matter what, they needed to use everything at their disposal to get rid of the threat.

After almost all had left, one person had stayed behind, and that was Samantha. Quinn had even asked for Oscar to leave and head back and find Mona for the time being. It seemed like Oscar was having difficulty deciding, but he eventually listened to Quinn.

"I know you have a lot of questions, so let me explain first how I found Oscar…" Quinn spoke softly as he went into detail. He told her about the vampire who was related to him, Richard Eno, a great scientist for the vampires and the same person they all knew as a great scientist for the humans.

He then explained how they had found Oscar at one of Eno's labs and just that. There was no need for Samantha to know about the trials, only how they found Oscar. However, the bit that was difficult for Quinn to speak about was Oscar himself.

How, if asking him if he remembered certain details, he didn't. Honestly, Quinn always thought of him as a different Oscar until the he had met Samantha. It was clear he knew who Samantha was, even if he didn't know about himself.

As Quinn finished his story, tears streamed down Samantha's face. She gripped her cheeks so tightly that the tip of her nails dug deep. Quinn had seen such reactions before. He knew this wasn't just sadness and anger; there was also much regret.

"The one you told me about…the Richard Eno, he came to me saying that he could bring him back, but he warned me…he warned me that father be different from how he was before if he came back…honestly, I don't know if it would have been better if he had completely forgotten me, but the fact that he remembers me…"

Samantha gripped her clothing around her chest, over her heart, pulling the fabric tightly.

"It just hurts even more…Quinn… I want to be stronger…I can't live like this…can you help me? Can you contact Richard for me? He made Oscar like this with only his head, so maybe with me-"

"He's dead." Quinn interrupted her. "That's why we went to his lab in the first place."

Hearing this, Samantha's lost the little hope she just felt. Although Quinn wasn't so sure if Eno was dead, and even if he was, most of the knowledge and information about Oscar was stored in Logan's head, but he didn't want her to continue searching for questions that would most likely never be answered.

Quinn had already asked Logan if there was a way to turn Oscar back, and Logan had answered it wasn't possible.

"I still need to get stronger. I'm not stupid. I know that if I beat One Horn, this feeling won't go away, but I have to do something for him. I have to help. When everyone fought and protected me, I was knocked out by some stupid sleeping gas. I couldn't even destroy a damn turtle's shell! So tell me, how the hell can I defeat One Horn like this?!" Samantha cried out.

"That's why, Quinn, you're the vampire king, right? Which means you can turn people. So turn me! Whatever you want, my blood or anything… just take it! but please turn me, and help me get stronger!" Samantha screamed as she dug her nails deeper in her palm, making blood drip from her hand over the table.

Quinn looked at it dripping from her hand and falling down. He then licked his finger and wiped it against the cut she had just made, and slowly it started to heal.

"Pretty neat, right?" Quinn said. "Our Sylvia can heal small wounds like this, but usually it wouldn't work this quick; that's only because of who I am. Just becoming a vampire wouldn't solve all your problems, and it doesn't work like that.

"Being a vampire comes with difficulties, a life where perhaps everyone who ever knew you and knows you will hate you. People will look at you differently, treat you differently, and most probably, you will have to hide your identity. I'm not saying no to you, but it's not an answer to your problems, and it's not a magic shortcut to gain great power. You will lose your ability, and you might be drawn to blood like this."

"You turned Sach into one, right?" Samantha said. "I know… I know…and I know about your past, Quinn. Oscar told me to find more about you once, everything about you. You had no ability, you were weak, the bottom of your class in every way possible, and you had no potential at all.

"Your whole life changed because you became a vampire. So don't give me that crap! Look at where you are? Just help me… please…" Samantha pleaded.

"You don't know what I've been through!" Quinn frowned, which caused Samantha to startle a little, but he took a deep breath and spoke again. "You don't know what I've been through," Quinn repeated, this time in a softer tone. "But you're right; if you're this insistent, then I will help you."

Quinn said as he bit his thumb. He lifted the blood in the air and dangled it just above her head using his powers.

"This is your last chance. Do you wish to be turned? There is a chance that you might turn into something that will force me to kill you?" Quinn asked for the last time.

Samantha nodded and opened her mouth as if she knew the next step. The blood then swooped from above and fell right into Samantha's mouth.

[The blood ritual has been activated.]

# Chapter 1484 - She Turned Into A What?
It had been a while since Quinn had turned someone, and he could never get used to this feeling because each time he did turn someone, there was a chance that they might turn into a dangerous subclass that needed to be eliminated on the spot.

It hadn't happened too often, but after becoming king, Quinn had seen all the different subclasses that the vampires kept for combat. There were far more possibilities than he imagined, and later, he had learned that the vampires had a way to influence changes towards one of these subclasses.

It looked like they had found some detailed research from the second family. Cindy had been doing countless experiments, and even with her powers, she was able to reverse a human after the latter had been turned.

She would do this again and again until reaching the result they wanted. In the second family, only she had such a strong ability. Bryce had extracted this information from the second family but had not shared it with the others.

On the side, he had been creating a vampire subclass army, mainly for war. Quinn had looked over these methods but never went into too many details.

Firstly, some of the details on how to make certain subclasses were unethical, and he could never imagine forcing a human to go through that to be turned into practically a monster. The second reason was that none of these methods had explained about turning them into other subclasses.

Quinn had his theories, but that's all they were, a bunch of theories.

"An undead is unlikely, right, but according to Vincent, anything is possible. Perhaps the circumstance for the turning could influence the result, but it was never a 100 percent guarantee, just an increase in chance."

This was why Quinn was surprised when the result had finally appeared. Samantha's transformation had gone better than most of whom Quinn had turned.

She seemed to be going through great pain but somehow held back her screams. She just sat there at her seat in the canteen instead of rolling around the floor in pain.

She was a strong person, and if she unlocked the power of Qi that was within her, she would be a great asset.

[You have successfully created a Draugr.]

'Another one? The only other Draugr I know at the moment is Linda, right?' As Quinn thought about this, he realised one thing, there was one person that might not be so happy about the change he had made, and that was Fex.

'I probably should have asked him before I did this…but I mean, it was Samantha's decision to be changed, right? And he shouldn't have the same problem that Layla and I have.' Quinn thought.

Samantha looked to be adjusting to herself, it was a strange experience, and she had a lot to learn. Quinn explained her transformation briefly and told her to see Linda understand her situation in detail. She would show her the ropes for now as there were still many other things that Quinn needed to focus on.

For one, there was another female waiting for him and most likely not for a pleasant chat.

'I better just get all these conversations out of the way.' Quinn thought as he headed to the Cursed faction members' quarters.

Everyone seemed to be in one of the large reception rooms or the converted training room they had created. Hearing about Quinn's return, a few people were waiting for him, and one of them was Hayley.

When Quinn entered the reception room, which had a bar with sofas and tables arranged all around, he saw Sam and Hayley sitting at one of the tables. As soon as Hayley noticed Quinn, she shot up like a bamboo shoot and stared at him.

'Don't make this more difficult than it already is.' Quinn frowned inwardly.

Upon approaching the sofa, rather than having Sam speak, he simply instructed everyone to start preparing the vampire soldiers to head off with Sera. Now that the group had come back from the familiar world, they were just wasting time staying here now. He promised he would speak to Ashley and the others before they left.

Everyone in the room became busy as Quinn took a seat opposite Hayley, with the latter drinking a cup of coffee.

'At least she looks calm.'

"Please, I already heard from Sam that my father has passed, but he wasn't there at the moment. I was hoping you could tell me all his last moments. What happened to him… why did he change after meeting you. I want you to tell me everything." Hayley requested.

'First Samantha and now Hayley.' Quinn inwardly sighed, but it was better to get done with these conversations; delaying it anymore would not do any good.

Quinn told Hayley the whole truth about how Paul and his men were the ones who discovered the vampire world. It was because of this that they were kept captive. It all happened before Quinn was king, so they needed to strike a deal.

Quinn was the one that had turned Paul, and the rest of his men, to save their lives, but when explaining, Quinn didn't make it sound like a good deed, and Hayley could tell how hard it was for him to say this. It was clear he wasn't proud of his actions.

Then he explained the rest, that Paul was a good person, and he had gone to look out for someone named Kazz. When talking about it, Quinn felt like he should have realised their close relationship sooner; it was almost as if he saw Kazz as a replacement for someone. Quinn didn't convert his thoughts into words and just explained how he saw it and let Hayley decide what was going on.

"In the end, he risked his life for this Kazz girl, huh, and she even still ended up dying? So there's nothing left of him, not even the person she protected because he is dead as well?" Hayley said as she sat back and let it all in. In the end, Hayley just started to laugh.

It wasn't the reaction Quinn was expecting at all from her, but soon that laughter turned into a single tear that ran down her cheek.

"That idiot," Hayley said as she smiled. "I have a favour to ask. I missed my father a lot when I was younger. He was a caring person, and he was the one that pushed me into medical practice.

"He bought me the most expensive beast gear which money could buy at the time when the war broke out. He never directly showed he cared about me but did do in weird ways, but I never saw some of the sides of him that you are describing, and I would have liked to have seen that.

"I know you said you are looking into turning the vampire soldiers back to human, but I believe it will be a long time before you do that. You need the vampires at this moment. Anyone could see that.

"I want to know why he went through this change, Quinn, and judging from your story and what you told me, it all happened with you. This whole world changed with you, and I even remember seeing you the first day. I never thought this would be the situation.

"I want to follow you, Quinn, and pursue in my father's footsteps. I want to do everything he has done and follow through his steps to see what he did, so I am asking you right now. Please, Quinn, if you can." Hayley then stood up from her seat and bowed down. "Can you please turn me as you did him?"

If Quinn were drinking something, he would have spat it out. Because not an hour had passed, two ladies had requested the same thing.

"Please understand it from my point of view," Hayley said, lifting her head, but all she saw was Quinn with his hand out.

"You don't have to say anymore. I know by now that I'll always lose this type of conversation. So after I tell you all the risks, I'll let you decide and will see, alright?" Quinn sighed.

However, this time, Quinn didn't know that the results of the change would be vastly different from what Samantha had turned into.

[Congratulations you have successfully created a Succubus]

# Chapter 1485 - A Growing Desire
Although they were at the centre of the reception room, Quinn felt like there was no need to drag things on and do Hayley's transformation somewhere else. If she turned into something dangerous, he had enough strength to subdue her before she went berserk.

Of course, he was still worried. The more he turned people, the more chance he had of hitting one of the bad subclasses.

The others in the room would constantly glance over to see what Quinn was doing. However, everyone here already knew what he was and saw that Hayley had requested this. They weren't just regular members of the Cursed faction but the leaders, and it wasn't like he was going against her will or forcing her into the ritual.

A drop of blood had initiated the ritual process, just like with Samantha. Quinn still had plenty of slots that he would always leave open, a little over 10. He kept it this way because he remembered when Vincent once told him that perhaps he might need to use it on those he truly cared for one day.

In some cases, if someone really wanted to be turned, like those in the Cursed faction, he would get the other vampires to do it, so it wouldn't take up his slots. The connection with Hayley just felt too personal for that, though.

Like Samantha, Hayley took it quite well once the turning process started. It was clear that she was going through pain as the veins popped up on her neck, and blood passed through them at a quick rate.

A few grunts of pain here and there, but other than that, she didn't show any signs of backing down.

'Are women just better at handling pain than most men? Or does it have something to do with the transformation?' Quinn wondered.

At the same time, he was thinking about just what Hayley would turn into. He found it strange that Samantha had turned into a B Subclass, an undead. Especially since she was nowhere close to being dead when turned, however, he did remember his thoughts before.

Although certain things might influence the result, they weren't the main factor to give a hundred percent guarantee about the outcome of the transformation. It was just that the chances of turning into that subclass were a bit more than the rest. At the same time, all choices were still available on the wheel.

Watching carefully, Quinn waited for the result and to see if Hayley would need any help; however, just then, someone came bursting through the reception doors.

The person pushed the doors so hard they had nearly come off their hinges, and everyone turned to look at who it was. Two figures had entered the room, one in heavy black armour, the royal knight Muka, and by her side was another royal knight, Fex.

Quinn knew Fex wasn't in a good mood, judging by his face.

"Quinn, I need to talk to you!" Fex yelled across the room.

'Uh, no, I mean, I knew he would react badly, but what is this?' Quinn frowned inwardly.

Luckily, it seemed like Muka still had some sense and was by Fex's side, trying to calm him down, and jumped in between the two of them before this turned into a scuffle.

"Don't forget he is still your king," Muka said, placing her hands on Fex's shoulder and slightly forcing him back. Fex's legs were still walking forward, but he wasn't moving anywhere.

"Yeah, well, this isn't me talking to Quinn as a royal knight; this is me talking to him as a friend!" Fex moved his head and looked at Quinn in his eyes, "Why didn't you tell me you were going to turn Samantha? You don't think I deserved to know?"

"Of course you did," Quinn replied while keeping one eye on Hayley, who was still sitting down. "But Samantha is an adult, and both of you have only started dating recently. She had already made up her mind to do this, Fex. Do you think if you talked to her, she would have changed her decision?"

"Of course!" Fex yelled back. "She might have just been emotional at the time. Maybe I could have calmed her down, and what would you have done if she changed into a subclass that altered her emotions? She could become a different Samantha.

"Or worse, what would you have done if she changed into something like a Wendigo? Would you have killed her and then come to me and said, 'Sorry, Fex, but she told me to turn her'?!"

It was clear why Fex was angry. He was worried for Samantha, worried that he might lose someone he had just gotten close to, and Quinn understood his emotions.

"Fex, I understand, but Samantha made that decision, and I clarified all the risks to her. Even if you were married to her, yes, both of you can make decisions together, but ultimately it would have been up to her. Do you think I like turning people?"

It was then that a groan had come out from the table opposite to Quinn. Fex and even Muka turned to where the sound had come from. It wasn't just any groan. It sounded as if someone had received the ultimate pleasure. As if they had tasted the best dessert in the world.

When turning towards the source of the moan, they could see a female standing. Both of her arms cuddled themselves, and their legs crossed over slightly.

"Quinn…what happened to me… am I a vampire?" Hayley asked, with her face getting red and almost visible 'heat' reeking from her cheeks.

[Congratulations, you have created a Succubus.]

"You turned another one! What the hell are you doing, Quinn?!" Fex clamoured at him again, still angry. When Hayley turned her head towards him, Fex noticed a single horn on the left side of her head. Her usual glasses had fallen on the table, and her braided ponytail was now undone.

Just then, they noticed something waving as well. It was a small thin tail.

It had been a long time since Quinn had seen a new Subclass, although this wasn't his first time seeing a succubus. There was Amy, who was close to Xander in the tenth family. However, he had never created one himself before, so he was a little interested in its ability.

[Infant Succubus: A common feature of a succubus is a single thin red tail along with a small horn sticking out from its left side. Although not all Succubus will have a horn on their head, but will sometimes grow in size depending on their sexual desire.

[Succubus are quite proficient in illusion and healing magic. Magic abilities cast by a Succubus will work more on males, depending on the attraction the latter has for the Succubus. They also have natural energy that will replenish over time; however, they must consume a man's special seed to grow and evolve.

[They often are beings that are said to have no love and only lust. Meaning they are able to bypass boundaries that other blooded can not.]

If Quinn was drinking something, this could have been the second time in one day where he would have spat it out because of the description. Of all the things for Hayley to have turned into, why would it have to be one that was a little tricky? Quinn couldn't help but wonder what could have been the major factor that led to her turning into such a being.

Upon closer inspection, he noticed a few other changes. For one, the size of her chest had gone up by a few notches. Before, if they were the size of apples, now they were like watermelons, and the military uniform she was wearing looked like it was about to tear apart.

"Quinn…I think… I need your help." Hayley said as she sat down, and something could be seen growing from the top of her head on her left side. It started to poke through her hair and was extending with every second.

"The horn… your horn is growing," Quinn said out loud as he was shocked and remembered the description. "How am I meant to help with that?"

"You were the one who turned me into this, so you have to solve this problem," Hayley replied back, sounding a bit out of breath.

*****

# Chapter 1486 - Just Do It!
"Oh my." Were the only words that came out of Muka's mouth upon seeing Hayley's appearance. She had let go of Fex and covered her mouth with one of her hands, and it was one of the very few times when her actions felt womanly.

At the same time, Fex was also awkwardly staring while trying to look away as the Succubus crossed her legs as if she was desperately holding herself from peeing.

"Quinn, you have to do something, don't let her stay in pain!" Fex shouted, holding up his hands in front of his face but at the same time was looking through the finger gaps.

"Uhh…do something? What do you mean by 'do something'?" Quinn stood frozen. He was beyond useless and practically dead weight in this situation, and Muka also knew it.

'Besides, if they are thinking what I think they're thinking, it wouldn't work, right? I mean the bond thing between a turner and the one they create. Although…it did say something about bypassing that type of thing in the system message.

'And… I can still touch Layla. That bond only seems to activate when I feel something. What am I doing? It's like I'm making excuses for why I can do it rather than not!'

Muka was the first one to act. She felt sorry for the young lady and ran across like a hero lifting Hayley on her back and carrying her over her shoulder. It looked like she was getting ready to run out of the room to head to a place that was a little more private than this.

"You two follow me; we need to solve this issue," Muka said, running off. Quinn and Fex looked at each other for a second before immediately following her, leaving everyone in the room who had overheard the conversation to wonder what was going on.

"Did you hear that groan?" One of them asked.

------

Eventually, the three of them had entered a medium-sized room. It was quite fancy inside and similar to a hotel. Everything was clean, untouched, and even a large bed was there. Quinn speculated that this room was most probably prepared for one of the board members to catch a nap or two during their meetings.

He felt like they were lucky to even have the luxury to sleep in a place like this during these times.

Muka placed Hayley on the bed and covered her with a blanket. But Hayley began to toss and turn as her horn grew, although a lot slower than before.

Since no one was around, Muka had taken off her helmet, revealing her face. This time her hair was of nice violet colour, making Quinn wonder if she had dyed it, or he didn't notice it before. He was also naturally drawn to staring at her perfect face, which was even more breathtaking than the beautiful vampires.

It was almost impossible even to describe her, as her face had a look to it like no other.

"You are a troublemaker, aren't you?" Muka giggled. "Creating a succubus of all things."

"Why is she like this?" Quinn asked. "What can we do to help her, or will it eventually pass?"

Fex was pacing up and down the room. For him, it seemed like it was a stressful moment. But there was a slight smile on his face as if he was relishing this, while Quinn was just full of concern and worry.

"I have some knowledge about them," Muka answered, walking over to Hayley, who was still tossing and turning. "When a succubus is first turned, her lust is at its peak, and it's similar to how a newborn vampire reacts upon seeing blood for the first time.

"However, certain things bring this on more to them during this time, for example, men. To them, seeing men would make them feel like how a newborn vampire feels upon seeing a cut on human skin. However, something could worsen this situation even further, and that is Virgin men. It would be like the sweetest blood you have ever tasted dangled in front of the vampires."

It was then that Muka gave a slight glance towards Quinn. It was as if she was asking a question without saying it, and finally, Fex couldn't hold it in anymore as he laughed.

"Hey man, you kinda deserve this and don't look at me. I'm not the one who made her like this."

Quinn's face was turning bright red by the second. It wasn't that he didn't have any interest in women, but when did he have the time for all this? Besides, there were plenty of girls interested in him, and he could have done the deed with any of them, but hey, saving his friends and the world had always been, well, the main priority.

"I guess it's best if Fex and I leave the room? That should solve the problem, right?" Quinn asked.

"Don't you dare, Quinn!" Hayley shouted from her bed. She had lifted her head up, and while she was still red and steaming, she said, "You caused this problem which means you're going to solve it."

"Well, you heard her." Fex patted his friend on the back. "I guess I should leave. This is a perfect room, and she's a good looking woman. All I can say is I hope for the best for you two!"

"Wait! When did I agree to this? Why can't you do it since this all comes naturally to you?" Quinn asked.

"I have Samantha now; I can't cheat on her this soon into a relationship. It would never work out. Besides, I have to help her learn the ropes because someone has created a headache. Don't worry, I won't tell Layla about this, and didn't you say that the two of you couldn't do it anyway? I'm sure even if she finds out, I am sure she will understand."

Fex was already heading out the door, and it looked like Muka was as well. She placed her helmet back on her head and gave a thumbs up towards Quinn.

"I will stay on guard and make sure no one comes inside. Don't worry. I will try not to listen." Muka said as the door was slammed shut.

Now the only ones in the room were Quinn and Hayley. Although Quinn was nineteen years old and an adult, he didn't know how and where to start. However, there was one experience he could draw from, and that was from Vincent's life. It was ironic that Quinn never wanted to try and remember the details.

"Hey, Hayley, does it really have to be me? Don't you have a boyfriend that we can call over? Or I can ask one of the vampire soldiers that doesn't have anyone. Think how awkward it would be between the two of us. I don't think I can even touch you, and the age difference?" Quinn asked, stepping back.

"Age difference?" Hayley asked as she began to unbutton her tight shirt from the top one by one, revealing her clear skin and the top of her large breasts. "I'm only twenty-seven, and Quinn, think about everything you have done.

"You have done so much; this should be nothing for someone like you. This is an easy task, so just please help me!"

———

Outside the room, Fex had decided to leave after some time. Muka was enough to stay in guard, not that they thought anyone would come by anyway. Still, he had a smile that wouldn't settle down. He wasn't happy about Samantha's situation, and now he felt like he had gotten his revenge back somehow.

Little did he know that fate had a strange way of working because after leaving the hallway and entering back in the reception room they were just in, someone approached him.

"Hey, Fex, have you seen Quinn? I was just speaking to Sam, and he said that you ran off with him earlier. I wanted to talk to him about something." It was Layla.

'Why do I have a sudden urge to really try and cause some drama today.' Fex smiled mischievously.

*****

# Chapter 1487 - The Royal Cherry
Although Muka said that she would try not to listen in, it was a hard thing for her to do. The hallway was silent, and, just like any Vampire Lord, her hearing was far sharper than a human's. So if she heard a few noises or two, then no one could blame her… right?

The Royal Knight looked around to make sure nobody would pass by, before taking off her helmet and pressing her ear up against it. She was wondering why there had been no noise for a while now. In her head, all sorts of thoughts were going on.

'It went really silent for a while… did he use his shadow to block out the noise?' Muka thought when suddenly she could hear something. 'Wait, that sounds like…footsteps!' The Royal Knight realised as she quickly placed her helmet back on and stood up straight, pretending to have dutifully done her job all this while. The door swung open and Quinn was seen standing there. He immediately closed the door behind him, and he didn't even look at Muka.

"The issue is resolved." Quinn stated, without any further explanation, using his left hand to pinch the bridge of his nose.

"So…did you do the deed?" Muka asked, intrigued, trying her best to sound neutral. Inside her head, though, she was picturing little babies already, Royal Princes and Princesses. Even though the vampire society didn't quite work like that, chances were that the children of their current King would grow up to become monsters of their own.

"No… not exactly." Quinn replied with his entire face getting red as he looked at his right hand, which immediately disappointed Muka to the point where her shoulders shrugged down. "It turned out… that she didn't need me to do 'that' necessarily… I just gave her… a hand… a shadow hand and… we figured out, she… just needed my… seed."

Quinn had to stop there. He had never felt so embarrassed in his life talking about any matter. For one thing, this was actually the first time he had talked about these types of matters. Growing up he never had anyone to talk to about these types of things, no friends during school, no siblings to inform him, nor any parents to ask them questions.

As such, it wasn't too surprising that he didn't even know how to naturally talk about it. Inside the room, everything had felt awkward to him… even though Hayley had fortunately taken the initiative.

It was then that the two noticed that Fex was walking down the hallway, and he wasn't on his own.

"Hey, are you done already? Well, can't blame you too much for your first time, although you don't look as tired as I would have imagined. Congratulations on popping your Royal Cherry, Your Majesty. " Fex made a formal bow, not even trying to hide the huge grin on his face. He had actually heard everything that was said while walking down the hallway, and by his side, there was no one.

"… alright, I'm sorry, I really shouldn't tease you too much about this. I overheard that you two… came to a 'mutual agreement'… for now. Anyway, you're a good guy, Quinn. A little too good sometimes, so I'll stop giving you a hard time.

"I understand that you did what you did because Samantha asked you to, and while I might not like it, it was still her decision. You have your own struggles to deal with, so I won't drag you into mine."

With one problem solved, Quinn could finally move onto the next matter at hand. Muka had decided to stay with Hayley in case she needed help with other matters. Later on they would arrange her to travel with the bulk of the Cursed faction as she wished to. However, Quinn asked her to wait until him and Fex were gone… as well as to give Hayley time to come to and dress herself properly, though he didn't voice that last part out.

"Ah, by the way, Layla was looking for you, so I told her that you were busy without going into detail. She said it wasn't important and not to worry about it, though if you want my advice, I think you should seriously have a talk with her at some point. At least before you go on your next grand outing. You were the one who told me to act, so as a good leader, shouldn't you be leading by example?"

Quinn did agree with what Fex was saying, even though he noticed the teasing tone in the last statement, the teenage boy required a break after that. He wasn't in his right mind after he had come close to doing what he was about to do, and even then, doing what he did…

'I've had two tough conversations with two strong women today, and I don't think I can deal with a third. … and I should definitely take a long shower after what I just did… although it was in the shadow space. At least I can take comfort in that.'

As usual, Quinn was busy as there was always something to do around the ship, and he decided to head out to the field after getting a report from Sam. Out where the VR platform would take place was the ship the vampire soldiers had landed in and infant of it, making preparations was Ashley, along with a few of the Unranked including Abdul and Sera.

Quinn had a catch-up with them all, apologising to them for not being able to act sooner to protect their families, yet nobody blamed him. They all knew what the situation was like. The Cursed had learned of the V, yet no one knew about them.

Asking for their families, not even their families would have believed such a tale. With that, Quinn wanted to talk to two more people before heading off.

"Sera, Leo is one of the best people I ever met. You can rely on him a lot." Quinn said. "He will forever be my teacher, and I learn new things from him every day."

Sera looked at the blind man, and he thought well of him, remembering back to his match.

"I think this time, he might learn a few things from me. Don't worry, I will take good care of him." Sera gave Quinn a wink, and knowing what energy resided in him, Leo just nodded his head.

They all got on board the ship, and a short while later it took off. They had a plan with which they slowly would attempt to deal with Pure and take back Earth from them.

Now, it was time for Quinn to make a decision what to do with the Cursed faction and the rest. The Vampire King decided to contact Alex and Andrew, the two main forgers of the Cursed faction.

He wanted an update on the vampire leaders' equipment. According to Alex, thanks to the new crystals that they had obtained from the vampire settlement and learned about, they were able to upgrade everything considerably and work at a better rate.

In fact, he estimated that they would be done in the next few days, which meant, after the armour was done, Quinn and Sam would have to plan their attack on the Dalki.

Armed with that knowledge, Quinn decided to head back in, and he was making his way to the reception where Sam was. He was hoping to call a meeting along with Sach and Owen, to try to see if they could all attack at the same time. They needed to discuss things in great detail.

However, while he was on his way there, he bumped into someone who he wasn't expecting or called. In the hallway, leading from the arena to the stadium, was Jin with his arms crossed.

As soon as he saw Quinn, he gave a respectful bow, and stood upright again.

"I have a report to make, Your Majesty." Jin stated. "A little while ago, you asked one of the families to search our solar system in need of a Nest Crystal. I was the one that had taken on that role and I have just received a report. I've just been contacted that my family has finally found one."

A large grin appeared on Quinn's face, everything was falling into place nicely. It was time to level up his system and bring out the full power to take on Graham.

*****

# Chapter 1488 - The Final War
When seeing a nest crystal in person, there was the opportunity for Quinn to use it to upgrade his system. There were two in total, and Quinn had decided to use one for Vincent's body, and not for a single moment did he regret that decision.

Although he never intended it to work out like this, it was a good thing that he could have a clone of himself, and it had come in handy during the Pure situation. On top of that, every time he saw Vincent, a warm feeling would overcome him. It was one of the decisions he was happy about.

The other nest crystal was used to continue creating the human clones to feed their blood to the vampires. Still, he hadn't given up on finding a nest crystal and had decided to ask for one of the vampire families to search for it.

Before Quinn went off to meet Sam and the others, Jin, the fourth family leader and the one in charge of the expedition, came forward to talk about something. The two of them walked slowly into the stadium to speak their mind.

"I don't want to be the bearer of bad news, and neither do I want you to think my family is incompetent, but there is a little bit of a problem," Jin informed his king. "My expedition team has requested help.

"It seems they are unable to get the crystal because of some unforeseen troubles and have asked for support. I understand that you said this was important to you, so I wanted to suggest sending some of the vampire leaders, including myself, to gather the crystal for you."

Quinn remained silent and thought for a moment. He wanted to prioritise the System upgrade, but he was unsure what it would do at the end of the day. Would it allow him to continue gaining stats, unlock skills? Or would it show an error due to Richard fully unlocking the system?

"Are there other options? Shouldn't there be more nest crystals?" Quinn asked.

"Yes, this is the first one we have come across," Jin replied. "Of course, we can continue searching, but we don't know how long it will take. Depending on the beasts protecting it, the difficulty to get the nest crystal will vary.

"It might be an easy task or become an impossible one. This one seems slightly difficult, but if a few leaders were to join hands, the progress would speed up."

Quinn had heard enough, and before that, he thought it would be best to talk to Sam about everything together. This meeting wasn't only for those in the Cursed faction. Members of the Earthborn group and those from the Graylash family would also attend this meeting. But before the main meeting started, Quinn wanted to talk with Sam about what had just been discovered.

"Hmm, and were you thinking of getting the nest crystal yourself?" Sam replied as if he could read a part of Quinn's mind.

"It did cross my mind," Quinn replied. "But I think at this moment, it's too dangerous for me to leave."

"But if you send the leaders away instead, then we would be sending a major portion of our forces. If we start an attack, there is a good chance that the Dalki will retaliate. I agree with what you said before. Attacking now while they're not ready is the best option. We don't know how long getting the nest crystal will take. You know better than anyone that you can't be everywhere at once. Let's discuss it with everyone." Sam said with a smile, still undecided about the whole situation.

All of the sofas were moved to one side of the room, facing the opposite wall, and Sam stood facing everyone. He was taking charge of the whole meeting. The Cursed faction made arrangements for the other groups, and the latter didn't have complaints about that.

If they didn't agree to something, they could always disagree and dispute it during the meeting.

"As you know, we have talked multiple times over the last few days, and so has Quinn and me, and the decision between everyone and what everyone believes we should do right now…is go on the attack against the Dalki." Sam declared.

No one spoke in objection; rather, they had determined looks on their faces.

"We have been on the defensive since the start of this war, and we finally have this breathing space. Yet there has to be a reason for it.

"As we discussed with the extra power of the leaders, they will be split into the two groups to give support. I am sure you all are thinking about where we will begin and how we can get the public to support us. Well, I have an answer for that."

Upon pressing a little remote, a video appeared by Sam's side, and it showed footage of a certain area in the Vampire Settlement. An area that showed many different kinds of creatures. Their figures looked similar to beasts, demons, things they only saw in nightmares.

"Are these beasts?" Hermes asked.

"No, these are something else," Sam replied. "They are under the command of the vampires. After speaking with the leaders, we have come up with a suggestion: Sunny will lead an attack to take back one of the Cursed faction's planets."

Sunny then stood up from her seat to make everyone aware of her and what she looked like.

"She is the fifth leader, and using the subclasses, as we call them, she will fight the Dalki. No human lives will be lost in the first attack, and it will show the alliance of the humans and vampires going well if the mission is a success.

"Once this mission ends, before the Dalki can even have the time to react, the Graylash and Earthborn group will move to get rid of the Dalki from their planets."

Some in the room were filled with fighting spirit, while a few felt a little prudent about this plan. They knew that defending was always easier than attacking in warfare, and the Dalki was an unknown enemy race. The number of Dalki forces, and their strength, everything was a mystery to them.

"What about One Horn?" One of the generals asked. "He is one of the leaders of the Dalki. Unless we get rid of him, it will be hard for us to move. Will the vampire leaders be enough to take him on?"

"We will give the necessary support for each group. The vampire leaders are strong, and we think that, like before, the Dalki will concentrate their power against the Cursed faction. We will be the charging force in this fight, and if they do focus on the Cursed faction, we will be like a lance destroying all their forces one by one."

The leaders of the Cursed faction had smiles on their faces when Sam said this.

"What about Quinn?" Another general asked. "We know he is the strongest out of all of us. Perhaps he should be the one to take on One Horn? Or will he be able to support us if things go bad?"

When the General asked this question, Sam glanced at Quinn for a moment before responding.

"He has another matter to attend to that will help us win this war," Sam answered. "We are not a one-man army, and no, I'm not stupid enough to think we can win this war without him. That's not what I'm saying, but Quinn has powers that allow us to call him over when we need him.

"If we were to locate Graham, the Dalki known and suspected to be their leader, we know that Quinn is the only one strong enough to help us face off against Graham. However, we have to strike now. The longer we wait, the more chances we're giving them to create an army of Grahams and One Horns. We all saw the Dalki that attacked the Graylash family and how it had gotten stronger. What will we do if it's too late by the time we react?" Sam added, "The vampire leaders are our trump card. They have agreed to help us, but I doubt they would ever think we would go on a full-force attack like this.

"The time to act is now! Understand?!" Sam proclaimed.

There was silence for a moment, and then the members of the Graylash family cheered. Then, those from the other sections cheered as well. Although the event led by the Board never expected this type of response, after seeing the so-called strongest, they had gained confidence in facing the unknown enemy.

"Thank you," Quinn said, placing his hand on Sam's shoulder. "Let's not waste any more time. Everyone, have enough rest. This will be the final war. We either win…or die. And I need to make sure I have the strength to end this.

There's a saying Sam replied.

"We will fight not because we hate what is in front of us, but because we love what is behind us!"

# Chapter 1489 - It Starts Here
After a few more questions from the meeting and the plan's finalisation, Logan handed a communication device to everyone present in the room. This way, they could adjust their strategies as and when needed while also being up-to-date with the situation.

Now, it was no longer about one group outdoing the other. For once, it seemed like everyone was on board with working together and getting rid of the threat. After that, things proceeded swiftly as everyone returned to their respective planets.

There were still a couple of days for preparations to be made, and once the vampire leaders had everything they needed, they would head out to the other planets as well. For now, it was a direct order for them to follow Sam's instructions.

However, if Sam was unavailable, then Muka and Fex were left in charge, which they all happily obliged to.

Quinn was heading out to where the Nest crystal had been discovered. He thought this was the quickest solution for them, to go on the attack while also making it so Quinn could obtain the Nest Crystal as fast as possible.

He was now back at the Daisy planet, where the vampire settlement was presently located. From here, he would use their teleporters to teleport himself to the vampire settlement's previous location.

Apparently, the vampires didn't have teleporters to all of the planets in the solar system. So Quinn would have to be patient while a ship picked him up, and from there onwards, he would head off to the Nest Crystal's location.

This was the faster solution compared to using the abandoned station that linked the beast planet solar system and the vampire one.

'This shouldn't take long. I can't imagine it taking more than two days at most… in the current situation…how many things will happen in two days?' Quinn thought. This was the only thought that would somewhat settle his mind, but he knew that the plans for the attack were now kicked in motion.

Worst case, he would use the shadow to transfer himself to the Cursed faction and help in the fight. For now, he needed to have faith in his comrades.

———

Currently inside a small commercial spaceship were Bonny and Void, the two reporters who became well-known and popular with the general public. Their ship was cruising through space, but it wasn't alone.

A small fleet of the Earthborn group was with them on guard. Although Bonny and Void weren't weak, they weren't strong enough to face the Dalki. Lately, since the news and details to the public were mostly delivered via their Livestream, the military and the other three groups felt it was important to protect them from any threats.

At the moment, the spaceship was on autopilot, heading to their destination. Void was tinkering with his drones and equipment, checking if they were all working alright, while Bonny had been staring outside looking at the fleet.

"Can you feel the tension?" Bonny asked, still staring out the window.

"Tension, you mean the tension of the war? It has always been there." Void replied, nearly dropping his camera off from the table, but he quickly grabbed it before it was damaged. In the pile of equipment, there was even the damaged camera that Quinn had broken.

Thankfully, the Cursed faction had paid for all the repairs and allowed him to get a new one.

"Can't you tell, or am I imagining things? But from all the reports we are getting, things have heated up big time. All the groups are on the move, and this much protection? Before, they would just send one ship to come with us and now a whole fleet."

"You might be right." Void replied, As he tested the camera by taking a snap of Bonny, who looked beyond annoyed when she saw how calm Void was, as the latter quickly placed the camera back on the table. "I mean, whenever the Cursed faction invites us somewhere, it's always for some big news or big attractions, something like that. So it will be the same this time, right?"

"No." Bonny shook her head. "I'm talking bigger than that. This isn't just the Cursed faction; all groups are moving. My sources have been updating me. This isn't the same as before. I think…this might be it."

Bonny's sources were volunteers from all the other planets. Bonny and Void already had their own application created just so people could follow them and get notified when they went live.

Nearly everyone had this application, and that included practically everyone who was not participating in the war. Still, with anyone who became popular, they would have some hardcore fans who wished to help Bonny and Void in any way they could.

Bonny would constantly keep her eye on online forums, chatrooms, blogs, and more. It was a good way to gauge how people were feeling and what they were interested in finding out.

She had read about reports of the Graylash people creating defensive measures and moving all of their members. Some of those from the Earthborn group were doing heavy recruitment. Even those who weren't part of the military were informed that they might have to fight.

All of these were clear signs that they were expecting something, which was why Bonny found it strange that both of them were invited right at this moment.

'The question is, are the Dalki on the move…or is it us?'

Eventually, the spaceship landed on the Daisy planet. However, it wasn't at the same location as before, nor was it a vampire settlement. They could still see the vampire settlement in the distance, but a little further from the main settlement, a miniature shelter had been created; this was the place they were about to land. It had walls and towers just like the main settlement, but even the top was enclosed, giving it an appearance of a giant black block when seen from a distance.

Upon landing, people who helped in escorting them soon left, and there to greet them all was one of the Vampire leaders and by her side were two assistants.

One was a small red-haired teenager with a black rabbit on his shoulder. While the other was an older woman whose beauty was on par with the woman who stood at the front.

Void lifted his heavy backpack with all his equipment inside and took along a few devices. He activated the drones since it was easy to have them active rather than carrying them around, but they weren't recording just yet.

"It's nice to meet you. I remember our visit from last time." Bonny said, bowing down.

Void bowed down as well, but his large back was so heavy it looked like he was about to fall over. Luckily, Rokene, the one with the black rabbit, had quickly gone to his side to grab him and propel him up straight again.

"Thank you." Void replied.

'We do have speed ability users, but not many people choose that ability. It's still strange to know that vampires can move that fast.' He thought.

"What is this facility?" Bonny asked, looking around, and she was half expecting to see Quinn or someone else to help explain what was going on.

"Oh, I see that you haven't been informed. I suppose you don't know what is happening, do you?" Sunny smiled as she turned around and went to enter the facility.

For now, Rokene had offered to carry Void's heavy bag, and usually, Void would have said no, but then he noticed that it was almost weightless for the teenager to carry.

They had entered the settlement, but the room was dark, too dark for them to see since the facility didn't get any sunlight from above.

"They have a request. They wish for you to film the first attack against the Dalki race for the whole world to see. And as the fifth leader of the vampire society, I will be leading the attack." Sunny explained.

Void was turning on his camera, not to record but to help him see what exactly was in the room because they could hear countless snarls and strange noises they had never heard before, which was, quite frankly, worrying them.

When Void saw what was around them through the camera, he immediately had an intense urge to put it down.

"Don't worry; you are free to record because the whole world will see them soon. Lights!" Sunny asked, and crystals started to shine, showing the whole facility full of the dangerous subclasses that Sunny would use in the attack.
