# Chapter 1730: Reason for being here.

Following their captain's orders, the guards immediately headed towards Geo. They pulled his arms behind his back and pushed him onto the ground by kicking him behind his knees. The guards doing this weren't firm with their arrest though, and Geo noticed that they were looking around at the people.

"They're uncomfortable with doing this." Geo noticed. "That means, even they didn't know that damn Nock would do this."

Still, it wasn't like Geo would try to fight the guards because he knew it would only worsen the situation. Even if he had the strength to fight all of these, he couldn't defeat the Sedi Rank people, who had reached the 25th floor of the Tower.

"Nock, what are you doing? Ever heard when you said that you wouldn't punish me for our little spar." Geo said.

"The tower guards aren't supposed to abuse their power like this. There are a lot of witnesses that saw what happened."

Nock still felt a strange feeling inside him after losing in front of everyone.

"I trained so hard in that Tower, pushed myself to the brink, but I couldn't even get past the 13th floor. But why did you come back to this damned town with how much talent you have!"

Nock just didn't understand Geo's actions and wished that the two of them could trade bodies. When looking at Geo, especially after the fight and confirming his strength, Nock felt annoyed that someone was giving up this gift they had.

Clenching his fist, he walked up to Geo, and while the others had him held, he suddenly threw one of his fists, hitting Geo right across the head, causing a fracture in his skin to appear on his cheek.

"Shut up," Nock said.

"I'm the one in the higher position now. I'm the one who is in charge of you and this neighbourhood. I worked hard, and earned this position, so you have no right to criticise what I do!"

"Witnesses? Witnesses to what, everything I have done is according to the Tower's rules. If you don't like it, change your fate by entering the Tower and rising above me!"

The more Nock spoke, the more frustrated he was and swung another fist, striking Geo on the other cheek.

After recovering, Geo looked up at Nock with a glint in his eye.

"You have changed, Nock. What are you doing? Did you get into this position just to be a bully?!"

"Are you just taking out your frustration on me because you have reached I your limit in the Tower, or maybe someone else is stomping on you in the Tower, so now you are doing it to-" Before Geo could finish his sentence, Nock was hit again and again.

Nock swung one arm after another, all aiming and punching Geo just in the ahead, and for the first time, through the cracks on the Amra skin, a light pink substance had come out, which was Amra's blood.

Due to their hard exterior, it was rare for them to see an Amra bleed, and seeing one in front of them, they knew that Geo had to be in incredible pain. Still, the punches didn't stop there, and the guards were losing their grip on Geo, hoping that he would do something.

They hoped that Geo would fight back or run away, but he did nothing and stayed on his knees, taking hit after hit, until most of his upper body and even the ground beneath his knees was covered with pink blood.

"What is this? Why isn't anyone doing anything?"

Gina thought, who was watching by the sidelines but could see the horror look on the others faces. Of course, they wanted to help, but what could they do?

"Is there anyone that can stop him, maybe if we ran to the tower and requested someone inside or met another captain?"

While thinking about it though, a certain image appeared in her head. It was a stupid one, but she was willing to try anything.

"I have to go." Gina thought.

Slowly, she snuck out of the crowd of people and started to run off somewhere, in the same direction from which Geo had just come back.

"Will you look at that," Nock said, huffing and panting. "Even the guards don't want to touch you. Come on, get up; let's have a rematch."

Geo was using everything he had just to stay conscious, and speaking would have resulted in a lot of pain, but he did do one thing; raising his head, he stared at Nock, and after a few moments, he shook his head a little in disappointment.

"STOP LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT!" Nock shouted, giving another punch, this time with two of his arms. It looked like it would be a big one.

"STOP!" Another voice shouted, and the sound of something could be seen going through the air. Turning around, Nock could see that it was a ball. With his other two hands, he caught it and managed to stop the ball but was pushed back slightly to the ground.

"Did someone just try to attack me?" Nock asked as he let go of the ball, allowing it to drop to the ground in place, and there he could see an Amra child.

"Solace? What does he think he's doing? He's going to get killed!" One of the kids slowly whispered.

"You're a disgrace!" Solace said.

"Every one of us looks up to those in the tower; we dream of becoming like them and changing our lives, but seeing you, no one wants to become like you."

"I hate that you were someone who came from our neighbourhood!"

Nock started to walk towards Solace but only managed a step before Geo grabbed him by the arm. "He's just a kid. Leave him out of this!"

Pushing on the arm, Geo managed to pull himself up from the ground and threw a punch. His body was weak and slow, allowing Nock to move to the side. As soon as he dodged the punch, Nock clenched his fist and threw another punch at Geo, sending him to the ground.

"Come on, get up, get up!" Nock said.

"Show me how useless I am. Show me I'm the one in the wrong when you are on the ground, and I'm the one standing here!"

Geo lifted his head once more but could only look at Nock. Who decided, again, to turn and head for the boy.

"You got good legs on you to kick a ball that much. Maybe you would have become a Tower Guard someday, but it's a shame you will never be able to use your legs again."

At that moment, pushing through the crowds of people, Gina had returned to see what was happening. She quickly figured out what most likely had happened. Turning her head, she soon saw another ball on the ground.

"I have to save Solace!" She thought as she ran up to the ball.

The others could see what she was about to do, another ball would end up going towards Nock, but the people believed that it just meant there soon would be two dead children. Readying her leg, she pulled it back and was about to rip it out and smash the ball.

Just as her foot reached the very top, she saw another figure standing next to her.

"What the..."

His foot moved faster than hers, and as soon as it hit the ball, it sounded as if a cannon had gone off. The ball flew through the air and hit Nock right in the head, throwing him to the side and giving him a shock.

Turning around, Solace could see Gina standing there.

"Gina... you did that?" ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ ꜰʀᴇᴇᴡᴇʙɴᴏᴠᴇʟ.ᴄᴏᴍ ᴏɴʟʏ.

In response, she shook her head, pointing to the person next to her. Lifting his head up, Geo saw a certain person and smiled even in pain while thinking, "Quinn... It looks like you are quite special after all."

Slowly Quinn walked onto the soccer pitch. The aura around him blew away the small parts of dirt on the ground. His eyes were shining red as an aura shrouded his body.

The other guards quickly proceeded to apprehend the stranger who had entered the field. On the other side, sensing the blood on the ground, Quinn began to control it and brought it away from the ground towards his own hands.

"I won't waste the blood you spilt, and I will use it to punish the ones that hurt you," Quinn said as he opened the palm of his hand. Out came several small darts of blood, moving until it was just on top of their heads.

Quinn moved his hand down, and the blood followed. Each drop of blood had hit the top of the Guards head's, and instantly they all slammed into the ground, each of their bodies creating a large crater on the floor.

Now on the soccer field, Quinn was the only one standing and had all eyes on him.

"You sent me here to teach me a lesson. I have thought about it ever since I got here. You wanted to show me how weak humans were, right? You want to show me how out in the vast universe, there are those stronger than us, right?"

"Well, screw you, Bliss. Let me show you my strength."

***

# Chapter 1731: Act like it.

The Amra around the arena stared at the stranger, all four of their arms covering their mouth after the shock. Despite how many were there, not one of them said a word, but they all had similar thoughts running through their minds. For one, the person in front of them wasn't an Amra.

And second, the person was only as big as their children. However, they were sure that he had overwhelming power, whatever he was. Someone who can take out all of the guards around in the area with just a hand movement was going to be something that these Amra people would tell their future generations for the centuries to come. Many felt this was the moment a new legend had begun.

"I thought he was just a humanoid beast... are there humanoid beasts that are this strong?" Gina thought.

Upon seeing Geo in trouble, the person who appeared in her mind was none other than Quinn. Heading in the direction where Geo last went, Gina was sure that he had taken Quinn to see Dober, and fortunately, her guess turned out to be correct.

And when she saw Quinn there, she didn't know what he could do, if he could or would be willing to do anything, but with tears in her eyes, she had pleaded Quinn to help Geo out and that he did.

"I'm starting to worry that our race is doomed if all humans are like you." Geo smiled as he pulled his upper body off from the ground.

"The funny thing is, I was thinking the same thing when I met you, but I can see that's not the case," Quinn chuckled, giving Geo a hand and pulling him off the ground.

It was an easy task for Quinn, but this was the first time Geo had felt the others' strength.

He couldn't help but wonder how such small hands contained so much power, and this was when Geo realised that perhaps he had this little person all wrong. But his smile soon disappeared, and a sombre expression appeared on his face.

"You must leave and get away from here. Quinn. I am grateful for your help and I know you only meant well, but those people in the Tower will pin all of this on you and send even more people to take you down." Geo pleaded.

"You want me to leave? Then what about you? What were you planning to do if I ran away? Won't they blame you for everything that happened?"

"Even if they don't, Geo, now that I have gotten involved, they will blame you for bringing me here." Quinn replied.

"Anyway, I wanted to speak with the higher ups of the Tower and this incident can be a good chance for me."

It was then that a particular individual started to get back up from the ground. He touched his head, where there was a slight crack. Looking at the ground, he could see the hardball broken to pieces.

"I was knocked out by this ball?" Nock thought, jumping to his feet.

"Who did this? Who dared to attack a Tower Captain?!" Nock shouted aloud.

When looking around, he soon noticed that someone had beaten up all the other Tower Guards as well. His anger turned into shock and soon into fear as he stepped back.

Then looking at Geo, he gritted his teeth.

"Geo, you know what will happen now? You would have gotten away with a light slap on the wrist, but now that you have fought against us..." Nock said.

"It wasn't him. I was the one who attacked them." Quinn answered.

"As you can see, I'm not really from around here. So I wanted to speak to your leader. Someone said he was in that large tower of yours." He finished while pointing behind him.

"Before I could even ask my questions, everyone came charging in at me. Now maybe you can help me without trying to attack?"

It was unfathomable to Nock that whatever just happened was done by the tiny person in front of them. He wasn't even an Amra. So thinking that the others must have teamed up to help him, or at least Geo had, Nock charged forward towards Quinn.

With his arms clenched, Nock was ready to attack, and as soon as he was in the range of Quinn, he started to swing them all toward Quinn. Seeing this sight in front of him made Quinn smile as he remembered something.

"This man reminds me a bit of the Block block game." Quinn thought.

Thinking like this, Quinn didn't attack back and did what he would have done if it was a game. He went ahead and blocked every single one of the four armed alien's punches. Even if Nock punched two areas simultaneously, Quinn would use his leg and arms to block the attack.

On top of that, Quinn could move his hand fast enough to block both hits before they would hit his body. This shocked everyone on the scene, including Nock, but the latter just increased the intensity of his punches. But all this turned out to be for a nought.

"The others thought he must have been using some type of magic to attack, but it looks like he can actually fight as well." Geo thought.

"This isn't talent. He's controlling Nock's every move, this is experience. I wonder how many fights this man must have been through to get to this level."

Out of frustration, Nock used all four of his arms simultaneously, aiming to grab Quinn. The response from Quinn was a stomp on the ground with his right foot while building up his Qi energy in his fist. Then, throwing out a Qi infused hammer strike, Quinn smashed Nock in the stomach before it could reach him.

Nock skidded across the ground and used all four of his arms to balance himself somehow. He eventually did stop, which surprised Quinn a bit. This race certainly was resilient but not resilient enough. Nock suddenly coughed his mouth, and pink blood spilt out. He had been injured on the inside.

"You!" Nock shouted, spitting the blood, "You will pay." ꜰʀᴇᴇᴡᴇʙɴᴏᴠᴇʟ.ᴄᴏᴍ

Pressing something on top of the strange helmet he wore, Nock started speaking and sending a report and asking for help from those in the Tower. Halfway up the Tower, in a giant bulti colosseum like structure, there were Amras in decorative red and black armour. This was the 50th floor, where the Sedi ranked tower members were. Around five of them stood around a pool of water.

The water surface was acting like a screen and in it was the picture of Nock, who was reporting the situation.

"Usually, most of our emergency calls aren't so drastic, but this seems to be the real deal?" One of the Sedi said to the others.

"I heard Athos directly asked the level 25 and under to search for someone or something. I have never heard him make such a request before."

The pool of water started to look towards Quinn, who stood there confidently.

"I find it hard to believe that this is the one that has Athos worried."

"Either way, I think we should deal with the problem before it becomes more troublesome for those in the city."

The Sedi ranked walked up to a rack placed on the side, and in it, there were several different coloured rocks. These were made of minerals that had never been seen on earth before and were of substances harder than Glathrium or diamond.

"You will destroy the whole neighbourhood with that." One of the Sedi frowned. "This might escalate the trouble."

"I'm sure Athos would rather have us get rid of the problem." The Sedi shrugged and headed to his right.

They were close to the centre of the floor, and after walking a few steps, the Sedi increased his pace. He swiftly passed by the buildings on the floor and soon reached the edge. There, there was a small window overlooking the city.

They were so high up that everything looked so small, but the Sedi could see just fine. He held the green coloured rock in his hand, and then carefully aiming it, he threw it with all his strength directly in a certain direction.

As it hit the clouds in the air, it dispersed them and many next to it, shifting them far away, making the sky clear. The speed and power behind the throw created flames around the rock, but it did not get smaller or change in size.

As the rock got closer to the buildings and went past them, it shook them just by the shockwaves.

"Move," Quinn said to Geo, noticing the energy coming toward them.

Geo wasn't quite sure what was happening but soon saw something in the distance and did as Quinn stated. In the next second, the ground was lifted as the rock slammed into Quinn's hands.

For the first time Quinn felt his body being pushed back on the ground, and the impact even tore off part of his clothing from his shirt, but his demon tier chest piece and his gauntlets stayed intact until finally.

Quinn stopped, and he had the green rock in his hand.

"That rock... it's from a Sedi!" Gina said out loud, and the others knew it as well.

This stone was the strongest mineral kept in the Tower. Everyone had heard of the stories and legends about these rocks, but this was the first time they saw it.

Holding it, Quinn clenched his fist, and the rock crumbled into dust and fell to the ground.

ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏ ʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ ꜰʀᴇᴇᴡᴇʙɴᴏᴠᴇʟ.ᴄᴏᴍ ᴛᴏ ᴇxᴘᴇʀɪᴇɴᴄᴇ ꜰᴀsᴛᴇʀ ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ sᴘᴇᴇᴅ.

"This man, how? How could he survive an attack from a Sedi." Nock thought. "His power....what level is it at."

Quinn looked towards the Tower where the attack had come from. In truth, it had hurt him a little putting pressure on his elbows.

"What would happen if I were to directly attack the tower?" Quinn asked.

"That... it would be impossible, but if you were successful, maybe Athos himself would come down." Geo answered.

Looking at his hand, Quinn made a quick cut on it and started to gather his celestial energy as he looked at the large Tower.

"Well, since I'm a God, I guess I should start acting like one," Quinn replied, as all the Celestial Energy amassed out and formed something in his hand that looked similar to a spear.

"A God...?" Geo repeated, wondering if he had misheard.

***

# Chapter 1732: Saying Hello

Since Quinn had received a boost in his celestial points, he had only used his powers recently. When sending out a beacon of his energy, using the strange device on top of Green City. However, he had yet to see it in action, actually using it in an attack.

Before, Quinn could only use the Celestial energy as it powered the blood in his body. Allowing him to fight hand to hand with the celestial energy, but recently, when fighting against Russ, he had discovered a way to use it externally by powering himself, cutting his body, and using blood control to control his very own blood.

This was precisely what Quinn was doing now, controlling the blood. Using this tactic did drain Quinn of blood, which meant he was losing health, but after seeing how recklessly he was attacked just then, he was a little annoyed in a neighbourhood full of those who had done nothing wrong.

The blood was forming into a large spear floating just above Quinn. It was larger than a standard spear as the handle's thickness was as thick as a human. As for everyone watching what Quinn was doing, they could tell it was something unordinary.

It wasn't just blood, but with the celestial energy running through it, it glowed brightly, pulsing as if it was alive.

"Is it magic? Can he perform magic!" Solace thought.

The guards that had been hit moments ago were starting to recover. Seeing the strange man that had knocked them out in the first place doing something weird and scary, they had decided it was best if they left and began to run away, all apart from Nock, who was staring in amazement.

"This power, I haven't even seen it in the tower, at least on the floors that I have reached. What power are they even using, and if one thing is clear, it's that he's not even scared of the Tower." Nock thought.

"Quinn, what are you planning to do? Who are you!" Geo asked, worried for more reasons than one.

Quinn had claimed himself to be a god if he had heard correctly. Could it possibly be that Quinn had come here to challenge their god, the one known as Athos? If that was the case, then whose side would Geo even be taking, and what would happen to their city.

"Don't worry," Quinn Replied as he moved his hand back. He was ready and had put as much energy as he wished into the spear. "I'm just saying hello, just like they did to me."

Without saying anything else, Quinn started to run, and the spear followed him. Then, when reaching the end of the soccer field, he threw his hand forward, throwing with all his strength the large blood spear.

It ripped through the air, dragging it along and causing a distorted image in the sky. For a brief second, over the city, certain parts of the sky looked red. Even after the spear left that area, red particles of energy lit up the sky until they eventually disappeared.

Only a few could see the object in the sky due to how fast it was moving until eventually, it had reached the tower. Inching closer to the large width of the outside, the spear looked like a speck of dust in comparison to the giant thing

After all, the tower contained floors full of numerous things, each floor big enough to be a city itself, perhaps even a little larger. When the spear approached, it looked to have hit something, Around five metres from the outside of the Tower, the spear was being held in place as giant waves and ripples appeared throughout.

"Is that some type of force field? It looks to have a lot of energy, and it covers the entire thing." Quinn thought.

The city folk could see the tower lighting up as the shield was activating due to it reacting with the spear. They had never seen anything like it before. The Amra had never even received such an attack that the shield had activated.

"I just need to give it a bit of a push." Reaching out his hand, even with the great distance, Quinn could feel it. He was in tune with his own celestial energy more so than blood. This allowed him to control it just that bit more.

Quinn started to change the motion of his body. He got into a fighting stance, his fists out, always feeling the connection in front of him. Then when the moment was right, Quinn slammed his foot on the ground and threw out his fist forward.

The surge of energy left his body similar to that of the hammer strike, and at the same time, the spear was pushed with extra force in the distance. The forcefield around it shattered, and slowly particles around the crack started to fade around the whole tower.

A pulse of red energy followed, covering the entire tower with it. The citizens knew something was up; something was clearly wrong.

After the spear shattered through the forcefield, it continued going forward, and the Sedi ranked tower guard's eyes opened wide as he saw what was coming toward him. With all four of his arms, green rock started to grow.

It looked almost like an ability, as his hands now looked to be made of Green gems. The Sedi guard had timed it perfectly, hitting the spear with all four of his fists, but it was useless. The energy pushed him away.

It had lifted him off his feet and continued to push him in the air, past all the fields of the floor they were on, through mountains, strange coloured rocks and more, until eventually, he had reached the special building where the other side was located.

ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ ꜰʀᴇᴇᴡᴇʙɴᴏᴠᴇʟ.ᴄᴏᴍ.

As his body broke through the walls, one of the larger Sedi ranks jumped out where the man was and used his strength to push him back, eventually stopping him in his tracks.

Holding onto his companion, he could see that the large spear had taken most of his upper body, creating a large hole that only left his arms and head intact. It was clear he was dead. Soon, the spear started to lose its form as it turned back into nothing but blood.

"He's dead...someone killed a Sedi, but who!" One of them shouted

"It has to be the one we were looking at before. Huhu had sent that attack out, and now he has ended up like this. It is clear that this person is beyond even our strength." The large one replied, but there was a smile on his face.

"It looks like we might have quite the interesting tower climber. Maybe he can even reach the top."

Although the others were initially shocked about one of their fellow members dying, based on the ridiculousness that they had just heard, they couldn't help but laugh.

"You know, there are several floors above us: maybe. since you haven't climbed in a long time, you have lost touch." Another replied. "Then there are those ahove them and Athos as well"

*** *** ***

In the tower itself, of course, the man in question, Athos was aware of what was happening at the very top floor. Everyone in the tower was because the outside shield had been destroyed, which was a first.

"This could be a good test for those in the tower," Athos said to himself.

"Maybe with this, it means that there will be those who wish to climb higher and have a goal to look forward to."

"If there is chaos outside, doubt in the people's minds, there might be more of those who wish to join the tower after these events."

"Whoever made this mysterious Celestial land on my planet, I thank you. At first, I thought that there might be something to worry about."

"I thought you were hiding your energy, but if that's your message back to me to show me who you are, then I'm afraid your Celestial Energy is weak. Too weak to do anything to me."

"I have more concerning matters, especially that godslayer that has already defeated a celestial and is getting closer."

When looking up ahead, through a strange portal like mirror, Athos was looking at a blonde-haired human.

***

# Chapter 1733: Enter the Tower.

The Tower didn't look to be in any worse state than before, but still, everyone had seen the outer shield of the tower break, which was no easy feat, and many were more shocked by the person who had attacked the Tower.

Seeing how everyone was acting around him, Quinn thought it would be best if he clarified himself a little to them, so they didn't have to worry.

"Don't worry, everyone. I just decided to return the favour to the one that tried to attack me." Quinn explained, also making sure the celestial energy in his body started to fade away.

"I don't intend to bring any harm to the people, and don't worry about the tower guards either because they won't be looking for me here since I will be entering the tower myself."

With such an attack, it was clear to everyone that the Tower wouldn't just stand by. They would certainly try and do something against this stranger that had entered their city. Hearing that Quinn would be going into the Tower put relief on their face, which meant it was best if Quinn was to get a move on quickly.

"Thank you for all your help Geo. I will clear up this misunderstanding." Quinn said, waving to him.

The crowd soon made a path on the way to the Tower, allowing for Quinn to walk forward. Everyone knew where he was heading to.

The truth was, Gina, who had called him over, wanted to run forward, hug Quinn and thank him for what he had done, but even she was scared a little by this stranger's powers. So instead, she just thanked him inwardly for helping out Geo.

"Wait, Quinn!" A distressed voice shouted from behind, and Geo could be seen standing on his two feet.

By now, he was mostly recovered from his injuries, which told Quinn that Amra also seemed to have regenerative abilities. However, it didn't seem anywhere near that of a vampire, it was still several times better than humans.

"I... I want to come with you. I don't know what you are planning to do, but I need to see it for myself with my own two eyes."

Although what Geo said was true, he had his own selfish reasons for going with Quinn. After learning of what he could be, of the reason he would be here Geo felt like there was a good chance that there would be a change within the Amra race, and he wanted to witness that change with his own eyes.

"I have no say in what you wish to do. I have just told you where I will be going and what I will be doing."

"I believe that you would know the risks of that better than anyone else here. In the end, the choice is yours." Quinn stated.

Hearing this, Geo started to walk over, and without any further talks, the two of them began to walk towards the Tower. Seeing how Geo was also going with the stranger caused the city folk to start to murmur between each other.

"Geo is planning to climb the Tower again? Does that mean this time he will become a Tower Guard?"

"Maybe he just wishes to see how far that strange person can get?"

"Or he feels responsible. Responsible for bringing that person into the city in the first place."

"He will feel like he has to stay by his side, especially if that person is challenging the Tower. That is just the type of person Geo is."

Whether they agreed or disagreed with what Geo was doing, no one tried to stop the two of them. They knew that they wouldn't even survive if they had the chance.

"WAIT!!" Another voice shouted from behind, and to everyone's surprise, even Quinn's, the one who had called out was Nock.

"I wish to come with you as well. No, I must go with you. The truth was... I initially came back here because I was stuck, I could not rise through the Tower, so I wanted to ask Geo to climb with me again."

"It's just when you overpowered me, something had taken over me, a fit of jealousy that I didn't know I had, but I have always done better. I have always reached new heights when I have been by your side, Geo."

"Please, I'm sorry for what I have done. Nothing I can say can change that, but I beg you to let me speak to the great man by your side to take me along with you."

Geo himself was a little stunned, unsure about what to do. He looked over to Quinn, who just nodded, telling him that the decision was up to him. To everyone around, the decision was clear as day.

"You can come, Nock." Geo replied.

There were audible gasps as they heard Geo's reply, but in the end, they remembered that this was Geo they were talking about. He was never a normal Amra like the rest of them.

"Me accepting that you can come with us means you are now my responsibility, do you understand that?" Geo asked.

"Your actions will be the actions of mine in front of Quinn. I don't wish to cause him any trouble. So I am gambling a lot by trusting your words."

Running over, Nock slid across the floor on his knees and placed his head on the ground, thanking them. After that, the three of them left the neighbourhood and headed in a certain direction.

The kids who had played football with Quinn started to follow them. As they followed through the neighbourhood, more and more Amra, interested in what was happening, joined the fray.

"What is going on?" One of the Amra asked upon seeing the commotion.

"That man, that strange-looking small man, was the one who attacked the Tower. He's going to challenge it now!"

As these words spread, the number of Amra following them also increased, but Quinn decided to ignore them because he was focused just on one goal ahead. While heading to the Tower, the group did make a particular stop, and that was at Dober's Shop.

"What the hell is going on?" Dober thought as he saw the alleyway was filled with people. It didn't take him long to put things together based on the events so far.

"I am heading to the Tower, and I will try to get the item you need, at the same time, if there is anything else you need in the Tower, just let me know."

"I will be happy to get it for you. You don't need to come with me, but I thought I would ask and inform you." Quinn said.

The Dober shook his head but couldn't help but smile.

"It has been a long time since I have felt this level of excitement. I see you somehow also managed to get Geo to come along with you. How could I miss this opportunity?" The man put up all four of his thumbs. "Bring me along."

Now with Dober in the group, the group had eventually reached the entrance of the Tower. There was a long walkway towards it that looked somewhat like a bridge, but it wasn't over any water body and on the other end, there was a large door.

When walking across the bridge, the people no longer followed them as they stopped and remained on their side of the bridge. Some wished the four of them luck, while a few even wondered how long these four would survive in the Tower.

"The two of us could enter the 10th floor and wait for you there, but I would like to see what you've got, kid," Dober said, talking about himself and Nock.

"This tower, how long does it usually take to complete a floor?" Quinn asked.

"That completely depends on you." Dober replied.

"There are floors that can take days, weeks, and there are even bottlenecks for people on certain floors."

"Sometimes they can't complete them for years before eventually breaking through and climbing even higher in the Tower, So keep that in mind, but I am sure you don't have to worry too much."

Listening to these words, Quinn slightly nodded and glanced at the three Amra in front of him.

"You guys have done this before, but still, I will let all of you know right now that I want to climb the Tower fast because I plan to get to the top within a day."

# Chapter 1734: Lookalike.

The grand event was still going on, with Peter having already cleared the third wave of AI robots and was about to go against the fourth. During his battles, people believed that the Crazy Bloodlord displayed his high-level skills.

This was because, so far, for every single one of the robots he had gone up against, he defeated them in one punch, and now it looked almost as if he was trying his best to avoid them.

Peter easily avoided all incoming attacks from the robots while making sure only to go for offence as the last option, and the crowd didn't mind this change of pace at all. On the contrary, they thought it was a clear display of one's skills, because the participant was now showing his speed and confidence. When, in truth, Peter was just buying time and delaying the round because of Logan's request.

"These robots are really starting to get on my nerves." Peter thought, avoiding an energy blast and a metallic fist from the right and left.

He needed not to get hit because sometimes it would cause problems in the transformation ability.

"Logan, whatever you are doing, please hurry up!"

*** *** ***

Meanwhile, in one of the booths where the contestants were waiting for their names to be called, Mitchell, Hannah and Lucia were in the room, and stood opposite them was someone who looked exactly like Quinn, the face they all saw in the statues.

"What do we do..?" Lucia asked.

"What do you mean?" Mitchell replied.

"We know the real Quinn is with us, which means the one in front of us must be a fraud. We have already had more than enough proof that our Quinn is the real one!"

Seeing an imposter in front of him was making Mitchell's blood boil, and he was ready to attack as the blood aura started to cover his hand. The girls thought what Mitchell said made sense and were also getting ready to do battle.

"Wait... you guys know the real Quinn? He really is back!" The stranger was a bit confused upon hearing Mitchell's words.

Ignoring the person in front of them so they won't get confused or distracted, Mitchell swiped his hand, throwing out a blood swipe while also running forward, chasing after it.

Seeing this attack, Quinn's look-alike covered his hand in blood aura and solidified it, so it made a type of small blade. Then, he slashed through the blood aura at the right time. His attack won out as Mitchell's swipe was smashed to pieces.

However, Mitchell was somewhat expecting that, so he was ready with his fist throwing out a punch. But before he could though, Quinn's look-alike knocked Mitchell's hand in the air, making the blood strike to hit a wall. He then grabbed his hand and twisted it while getting behind Mitchell.

A lightning bolt came straight towards Quinn's look alike, who had no choice but to throw a kick out since his hands were still holding onto Mitchell, restraining him up. A long straight line of blood aura had hit the lighting strike perfectly.

Then there was Hannah to deal with. She had her two blood daggers, but before she could move much, Mitchell's body was already being hurled towards her with great strength, hitting her in the stomach and sending her flying back.

"You guys should really listen before you act," The Quinn's look-alike said, "Look, if you guys know who Quinn is, then just tell him that I have come. I'm sure it will clear up the misundersta…"

Before the Quinn's look-alike could finish his sentence, the others regrouped, and Mithcell was also ready to transform, clearly seeing that this vampire's blood aura was strong, incredibly strong. In fact, if he had met this person first before the real Quinn, he was starting to think that he would be fooled.

However, time had run out.

"The Crazy Bloodlord has successfully defeated all five waves!" Then, they heard an announcement from outside. "Now, it is time to bring out our next contestant!"

The door to the arena began to open. Quickly picking up the robe himself, Quinn's look-alike was ready to cover himself and leave the place. Mitchell had prepared his blood rifle even though he didn't have time to transform.

Still, the Quinn's look-alike had rapidly fired out several blood swipes heading toward all the three of them. The group had to concentrate on blocking the attack in front of them, and during that time, the Quinn's look-alike had already left and was out on the field.

At the last second, the blood swipes started to move as if being controlled, and during that time, all of them had hit the ground rather than the three.

"That..was blood control!" Hannah was surprised, "It must have been a bluff attack in the first place. I guess he really wasn't trying to hurt us."

The others had quickly realised this as well, but the question was if the Quinn's look-alike didn't have any hostile intentions, why was he pretending to be Quinn, and for what purpose?

*** *** ***

When being called out with the name Quinn Talen, the Quinn's look-alike had received many boos from the crowd. Many didn't like a random person using Hero Quinn's reputation for attention.

Regardless, the new rounds had started, and the first wave with one of the black Ai robots started to head towards the hooded Vampire who stood at the centre of the arena.

As it came close, that was when the robbed figure held out his arm, just pointing it in the Robot's direction. The Robot was fast, faster than many beasts and could reach speed beyond that of vampires as well.

It was the reason why Logan would use them in combat, but the Vampire in question was aware of this fact, which was why he was waiting for the right moment as he made a pistol with his fingers. And after a few moments, the Vampire fired a blood bullet from the tip of his index finger, and it went right through the hard exterior of the black AI Robot, damaging some of the circuits inside.

The Robot's head flung back a little, but the attack wasn't enough to beat the Robot or put it out of action.

"I just wanted to slow it down a little bit." Quinn's look-alike thought as he threw his other hand right towards the Robot's stomach. In this hand, he had been gathering a ball of red aura, almost the size of a basketball.

When it hit the Robot, the ball started to spin in all sorts of directions, and because of the great force, the Robot also spun. Eventually, the Robot was sent flying through the air with the ball of red vampire aura.

The attack didn't destroy the Robot, but its parts were falling out of the sky. Seeing this, the robbed man then closed his fist, and at the same time, the ball of energy exploded, and with it, the Robot was blown to pieces and seen falling to the sky.

After witnessing the action, the boos from the crowd had died out, and there were even a few claps.

"That was amazing; I've never seen a vampire have such blood control before!"

"I know he's not Quinn, but he's surely a powerful vampire."

The crowd was starting to turn, and before the second wave had begun, the robed figure had started to do something. He placed his hand on his robe, gripped it tightly and threw it off from his body, revealing his face to the whole world.

The camera showed footage of a close up of the person's face, and everyone now could see in the middle of the arena that there was a Quinn's look alike.

"Computer, do a matching trace right now!" Logan shouted, seeing the person on his screen.

Immediately, the computer stated that the face of the person on the stage matched 99.9% with the real Quinn's face.

"This can only mean one of two things. It's either a vampire who has a transformation ability or finally... finally, for some reason, Vincent is here!" Logan thought.

***

# Chapter 1735: Top five.

The crowd had fallen silent too many times during this whole event, there had been surprises that they had never suspected, and it had happened once again. The resemblance between the person in the middle of the arena and Quinn Talen was uncanny. They all knew it as soon as they saw the face.

Immediately, the crowd began to pull out their devices to record the event and send it to those on other planets. Logan had attempted to stop it by activating a device that would jam the signals, but it was already too late.

Videos were being sent all over, and programs were being used to try and match up the faces between the two. Matches were coming back, confirming with near a 100 percent chance that they were the same person. This all happened in a matter of seconds because of the advancements in technology.

The reporters that had been unable to attend the event due to Logan's request were kicking themselves in the foot. Logan wanted to control what could and couldn't be televised, and since it was an event anyway, who could capture news better than him, he just never imagined this.

"With that special blood control form earlier, does this mean it's really him? Did Quinn Talen really return?" People in the crowd started to discuss.

"It could just be someone with the transformation ability. We have had something like this happen before. Only this one is a little stronger, so more people believe it."

"Hero Quinn died more than a thousand years ago. How could he come back now? And even if he did, does he need to show himself like this?"

"I agree. Even though this vampire's powers are strong, and if it's not because of the transformation ability, then this is plastic surgery, or maybe specially made masks or something, because I know for sure that this is not Quinn."

"Also, notice that he doesn't have Quinn's armour, and another thing, why would he enter an event where the prize is something that belonged to him anyway?"

As conversations and arguments continued, more and more people were convinced that this was just another fake. But it was a convincing fake, at least. Because, for one, this Quinn didn't have specially made armour set the blue fang, nor did he have the Shadow power. There were a lot more things that weren't adding up.

That still didn't stop people from changing their boos to cheers, as they believed they could at least be witnessing the reincarnation of Quinn, a strong vampire who resembled him.

The event continued as it was meant to, but now the people kept a closer eye on him. The second wave was beginning, and just like before, the vampire was showing his skill using red aura in ways that weren't typical for other vampires.

In the special booth watching everything, Muka had quite the expression on her face.

"It has to be... that has to be Vincent. That's the only explanation."

"I have seen him fight a few times, and in some ways, it matches up to what he would do, at least when he uses his hand to hand combat."

"What I don't remember about him is having that much blood energy and blood control. Something has changed."

It was then that the others had returned, explaining what they had gone through and now hearing their story, Muka was sure of it.

"I believe that man was telling you the truth... he is someone that Quinn knows, and in fact, the two of them are related," Muka replied.

Scratching their heads, the others just had to get used to the fact that even though they were travelling with Quinn and had already learned so many things about him.

There were still a lot of things that weren't shown in the museum or in the presentation by Logan.

Quinn and those around him would always be mysterious, and many things have happened over the course of the last thousand years after Quinn defeated the Dalki.

Fake Quinn had managed to clear all five waves of the event, giving him one of the best results of the competition so far.

It still didn't change many people's minds because they hadn't seen the vampire use any shadow powers, even during the instances when he struggled against the robots.

However, many believed that they were witnessing something special, a reincarnation of the Hero.

"It's a shame that this tournament isn't a one on one battle. Maybe we would have gotten some answers to your question before." One of the crowd members sighed.

"Oh, you mean that question about who is stronger, the Crazy Bloodlord or Quinn Talen?"

"I mean, I don't think that would answer our question, but I think it would at least be an entertaining fight."

*** *** ***

Eventually, the event for the day came to an end as the night sky enveloped the Earth, and people were starting to leave their seats. But nevertheless, they would be coming back tomorrow, as there was still one final day of the event, and the crowd was going with their hearts thumping with excitement for what was to come.

There were many strong contestants, one from Pure who had reached four waves, and even a dhampir had entered to test their skills, showing beautiful swordsmanship.

However, in the end, there were a total of four stand out contestants, and five contestants had proven themselves by defeating all five waves of Al robots in a row.

Jake Green, whose performance went as expected once they had heard he was entering. Then there was the AAA rank traveller Icas, who originally was one of the favourites to win the event. The two robbed vampires, one who was claiming to be Quinn Talen and the other showing off the special shadow powers.

It was another shocking event, which made those assume that the vampire was a guardian working for the red vampires, but the crowd wasn't scared. After all, there was only one of them, while there were plenty here who supported the Green family.

Finally, there was the Crazy Bloodlord. These five will be returning tomorrow for the final event.

What it entailed, no one really knew, but even without knowing, everyone was sure to return tomorrow.

However, one contestant wasn't free to leave as he wished. When Quinn's look-alike tried to return to his room, he found himself locked in the room itself. Then, as the crowd left and the door was finally opened, the other side didn't look the same as when he entered.

The hallway had changed, and there was only one path as if it was leading him down a particular way. Seeing this, Quinn's look-alike just sighed. He walked down the hallway and eventually could see the light at the end.

Stepping into the light, he entered a room where there were seat refurbishments and more, and on top of that, several people were waiting for him as expected.

"Vincent," The first person to speak was Logan, "The jig is up. Muka and I know that it's you, and we have many questions to ask you."

The Quinn's look-alike was indeed Vincent. He first looked at the faces of the people in the room, and upon finding that the person he wanted to meet wasn't there, he pursed his lips and sat down on the sofa opposite everyone else.

"Oh, how the times have changed. I never thought that I would be on this side of the sofa, being interrogated by you."

"It was always me helping you young ones back then, and now look how much power you have." Vincent replied, not denying it was him.

"Before that, I have something I need to ask you guys, and it's crucial."

"Judging by the fact that Peter is standing here, it's safe to assume that means Quinn has also returned. So, where is he?"

The others looked at each other with traces of guilt on their faces. Because the truth was, they didn't know where Quinn was, but until a few days ago, they did. In the end, Logan explained what they knew of Quinn to him and told him everything they knew.

"This is very unfortunate. I made my move to call him, hoping to attract his attention."

Vincent sighed, "I thought if someone was pretending to be him, he would have come after me."

"I didn't realise I would be too late, and that high energy the other day that was him... we need to find Quinn."

It was nice to know that the person in front of them wasn't the enemy, but although they agreed they needed to find Quinn, they had no idea how to find him while attempting to continue his other goal of finding the red vampires.

"Quinn will return to us. We are trying to help Quinn find the red vampires. He said he is looking for the vampire Layla," Jessica replied.

"Layla? He's still thinking about her after all this time?" Vincent looked surprised. "Well, either way, would like to avoid the Red vampires as much as possible."

Hearing this, Logan stood up because he felt like there was a double meaning behind those words.

"Vincent..does this mean? Do you really have it... the red heart?" Logan asked.

Red Heart was the item that the Red vampires, Pure, and everyone in the world were looking for.

***

# Chapter 1736: Location of the Red Heart.

The red heart was a big deal to each group for several reasons. First, as for what each group wanted to use the red heart for, it was unknown, but everyone could make educated guesses. In some cases, some groups just wanted the red heart, so others couldn't use it.

The question for the longest time though, was where was this mysterious red heart in the first place? A large red crystal had been dropped after the battle between Hero Quinn and Graham. It was a condensed form of energy from Quinn's awakening powers and the blood of some of the strongest people in the history of the Earth.

It was most likely a once in a lifetime item, one's conditions that would be impossible to replicate and create another. There were those that studied the final fight with Quinn after seeing the red crystal.

Knowing the power of blood crystals that the vampires created and others learning of this fact, soon the Red heart was something that was desired by all. But the problem was, the red heart had only been seen on that day, and no one ever saw it again.

In ways, it increased the rumours of its powers, this mystical item. People weren't even sure it could do what they believed it could do. Either way, Logan was one of these people who wanted the red crystal.

Since it had only been seen once, the one responsible for taking it must have been close at the time of its disappearance. That left mainly those that were in the Cursed faction. The other members knew why Logan wanted it, and he believed the item was best in his hands in the first place.

Why the others wouldn't have given him the Red heart if they had it, he did not know, which was why he believed that the most likely culprit was someone else who had gone missing as soon as Quinn had gone into a slumber, and the most likely suspect for all of that was Vincent.

"You meet me after all this time, and you ask about the Red Heart? I guess I was right to keep that item to myself after all." Vincent crossed his legs and casually looked away from Logan towards a corner of the room.

"You should know that the Red vampires are after the red heart. I don't think you meant any harm in keeping the Red heart, but if it was to fall into their hands then I-"

"Then they would do something dangerous with it, and that is exactly why I won't be telling any of you either," Vincent replied.

"I won't tell you what or where the heart is. I have been away a long time, and I have been keeping up with the actions of others."

"You are pretty close to the Pure, and they have close ties with the Dhampirs."

"If you had the red heart, it could easily fall into their hands, so the information is best kept with me."

"The only person I can trust with the information about the Red Heart is Quinn himself. He is the one that deserves it."

"So if you want to know about the red heart, I suggest you put a lot of effort into finding him."

The others could see that this angered Logan. The wrinkles on his forehead increased, and his arms were slightly shaking.

He had put years and years into searching for the Red Heart, and now the answer was right in front of him, yet, the person refused to talk to him because he couldn't trust him.

"You think you're the only one that cares about Quinn. I have been helping him since the beginning. How can you not trust me?!" Logan eventually burst out.

Still, it looked like Vincent wouldn't reply and continued to ignore the others. Eventually, with everyone turning silent, Vincent stood up from his seat.

"I have stayed out of the chaos and fighting for a long time. My life ended long ago, and I only came back to help Quinn."

"Although you are all Quinn's friends, you are not mine. So when I do something, I do it just to help Quinn."

"If you have any more information about him, then call me. I will also be happy to help you with anything, as long as it is about bringing Quinn back."

"Once I finish this event and give my message to everyone."

The others looked back at Logan, wondering if they should say something. If Logan asked them to stop him, they would at least give it a try.

Whether or not they could stop Vincent was another thing, but they believed they at least had a good chance with Peter by their side. Even though Peter looked uninterested in the whole thing, standing in the room corner. However, in the end, Vincent left to do his own thing.

"So, what's the plan now? I mean, he knew about the red heart and is he going to keep pretending to be Quinn? I'm really confused right now." Jessica frowned.

The truth was, all of them were perplexed.

"Don't worry so much. Vincent is in my city now. Wherever he goes, whatever he is doing, as long as he is on Earth, we will have information about everything."

"Eventually, Vincent will be able to lead us to the Red heart." Logan said to everyone.

It was a new day for Green city and the last day of the famous challenge event. Crowds were pouring into the area with smiles on their faces, all waiting to see the event's outcome.

At the same time, all of the contestants for today were present as well, with the others watching them from the stands. Taking part, Logan had given them a ticket, including those that had entered the preliminary rounds.

As for Muka and the rest, they were in the special booth once again, all apart from Peter, who would be taking part.

Inside the arena, all five contestants were standing quite a distance apart, and today too, Vicky was here to host the event.

"Ladies and gentlemen, before we begin, please let's give a round of applause for the five contestants in front of us!" Vicky announced, and the response from the crowd was immense, with roars that shook the stadium.

"Now, before explaining the rules for today's event, I will show you all the grand prizes!" A podium rose from behind Vicky, covered in a hard glass case.

There looked to be a sword coming out. There were many people stretching their necks to get a glance at the prize since they thought the item was meant to be related to Quinn, even though his tales said that he fought with hand to hand combat, but those that knew Quinn had seen him use this particular sword a couple of times.

"The sword behind me was a gift to Quinn from the Earthborn group. Quinn had helped them in the past and received this Unbreakable weapon as a reward."

"My husband, Logan Green, has personally verified that this weapon, with a unique trait, was once held by Quinn Talen."

Hearing about the time and item that Quinn personally used, many of those in the crowd wondered just how much a weapon like that could go for.

Surely, many wealthy folks would be willing to trade even demon tier crystals to have that weapon on their hands, not because of the power but because of its meaning.

"Now, I will get to the rules for today's round. There will be one event today and exactly one wave."

"All five contestants will be going up against each other, and it will mimic the preliminary rounds."

"And with that, two hundred hundred black coloured robots will be released into the arena."

"The goal is to survive and take out as many as possible. Then, the one who takes out the most Black Al robots before they or the rest of the contestants are defeated will be crowned as the champion."

"And in this round, you are free to do as you wish, so do whatever it takes to get the most points and win the contest and the grand prize!" Vicky smiled.

The audience started to cheer because they knew the meaning behind these words, and it looked like they might see some of the participants going against each other after all.

***

# Chapter 1737: The Guardian's powers.

Being the contest's winner wouldn't necessarily mean that winner was the strongest, but that didn't stop the crowd from having a friendly bet about who they thought would win, and the way they were betting.

It was as if it was a momentous battle between the last five contestants who were now in the arena.

"What do you think Peter will do?" Lucia asked, biting the skin beneath her fingernails. The others could tell it was somewhat getting to her.

"Are you worried about him?" Jessica nudged Lucia's shoulder a little, knowing fully well how the other felt about this particular person. It was pretty obvious, at least for the women, it was pretty obvious with how Lucia had been acting recently.

"It's not that. I mean, do you think he will actually try in this contest? Will he try to win, or if he will just give up? I mean, we all know the prize isn't that important." Lucia quickly replied.

"Rather, our goal is to find the Red Vampires. Since we know about the guy who's using shadow powers, doesn't that pretty much mean he's a high ranking Red Vampire member?"

Hearing this question, the others turned to Hannah.

"I was actually hoping to meet a lower ranked member. The Guardians, I don't know much about them. They work closely with the other leader..."

"So yes, technically, we could get the information we want, but our leader...well, from Logan's report, we all found out that the leader I follow is named Layla."

"She instructed us to do whatever we could to avoid the other faction and not get on their bad side."

"There are often disputes between the two leaders, which was alright, but she had gone out of her way to warn us about this."

"Then I will say one thing," Muka added.

"We should be ready to jump in at any moment. Vincent was right about one thing, Quinn is important compared to this whole event."

"And I know for sure from his actions in the past, he would do anything to try and help Layla. So if we find her, I think we will most likely find Quinn. At least that is what my instinct is telling me."

"Your instinct or your special ability?" Mitchell asked, to which Muka just smiled and said nothing else, compelling Mitchell to look away.

Otherwise, he was afraid that he might ask her out. Even with wearing sunglasses and a mask, there was something about how she tilted her head and how her hair flowed that anyone could tell she was a real beauty.

"Alright, everyone, please let the match begin!" In the arena, Vicky announced at the top of her lungs, bringing everyone's attention towards the incoming battle.

She then jumped up and stood on the edge, on the other side of which was where the rest of the crowd was present, then she slammed a button, which meant it was time for the event to start. Immediately after, several spots on the ground began to open up just like before, and from them, the Black AI Robots began to rise.

All of the robots appeared simultaneously and were double the amount of the preliminary. Seeing the large number shocked the crowd as the robots turned towards the five contestants.

At first, it looked like the contestants were ready to do battle with each other. They warily looked at each other from the corner of their eye, ready to use their powers and abilities. But now, seeing the number of robots coming toward them, they all instinctively knew they needed to deal with the trouble in front of them first.

Peter rammed one of his fists right towards the robot's body, smashing it to pieces, but quickly another five had flown straight towards him, hitting his legs, arms and body. Finally, with all five using the power of their thrusters, they were somewhat able to push Peter back.

Still, with his rage and great strength, Peter was able to move one of his arms and pulled the over robot off himself, slamming it into the ground. It wasn't enough to destroy the robot, though, unlike his direct punch, showing just how sturdy these robots were and how much trouble they could cause these five great warriors.

Out of all of the contestants, the one that was having the easiest time with the robots was Jake Green.

Mixing the Earth Ability and the Hardening Ability gave him control of a metal-like substance.

Jake would then shape it how he wished to protect himself and shape it into a weapon that could destroy the robots. On top of that, after defeating the robots, Jake also seemed to be able to control their body parts. Whether with telekinesis or something else, it was apparent to those watching that Jake was the most likely winner unless the other contestants chose to stop him.

"Damn it, Jake's ability is really suited for this type of competition. It makes me think that the Greens rigged this whole thing."

"Really? You know that he has the Blades ability, any ability he can use, so it is not just this competition, but in any match, Jake has the advantage, you numbskull!"

The others were also putting up a good fight, particularly the triple AAA rank fighter Isac. In the previous round, Isac had shown several different things. For one, his arms had become hard, similar to the robots material.

On top of that, he breathed fire, shot spikes out of his back and more. It almost made others assume that his power was of the transformation type and he was just mimicking beasts that he had fought against.

However, for the first time in the match. Isac had transformed parts of his body into something they hadn't seen but knew. Scales ran up and down his arms and showed partially on his face. He had turned himself into a Dalki in this fight.

That was because Isac's power was a unique original power that allowed him to turn any part of his body into anything he had eaten before. This wasn't just limited to beasts and included the materials as well.

His teeth and the digestive system allowed him to eat anything and could even make his whole body into Glathrium if it gave him the advantage, and in this situation, he had chosen to turn into a Dalki.

As for the one who claimed to be Quinn, he also put on quite a show, showing his blood powers. Blood swipes shot out as if they had free will, allowing him to hit and avoid being touched by the others.

That wasn't all. His combat skills were also nothing to laugh at compared to the rest. With everyone fighting the robots, the latter's numbers had dwindled to half, and soon the five finalists would defeat all robots.

This was where the crowd believed things would start getting interesting, as the contestants fought for the last few points that were out there on the field.

After destroying two robots, Vincent landed back down on the ground and spotted another robot. He charged forward only to be stopped by a dark shadow, and when the shadow disappeared, the robed man was in front of him, and he had destroyed the robot.

"That shadow power has always been annoying." Vincent couldn't help but say.

"If you are who you claim to be, you should also have this power, should you not?" The voice behind the robbed figure had spoken for the first time.

Vincent thought about whether or not he should retaliate or just move on with the contest. Looking at the scores, he wasn't doing too bad, and he did somewhat have a competitive side to him. In the end, Vincent decided it would be best if he just searched for other robots.

"I'll let the others fight and just win this damn thing." Vincent thought.

As he was about to turn around though, he could feel immense energy rising from the robed figure, and it didn't feel like just a vampire aura. All ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ full.com

"My target for this whole event has never been the contest. I just joined to kill time, but I never thought I would meet you. Whether you are fake or not, it doesn't matter." The robbed figure said as his shadow spread above him from his back.

In the next instant, several beasts dropped from the sky and landed in the Arena. A large bear with claws that were as long as its forearms. A two-headed snake with the body of a horse. A giant flying bug like creature with six wings with several eyes on its head.

It was clear that all of these were high-level beasts, and whether this was against the rules, the crowd quickly started to wonder as they glanced at Vicky to see her reaction.

"There is something... strange about these creatures...they don't look like your typical beasts." Vincent thought.

On a close inspection, all beasts had a tiny flicker of the shadow even though they were no longer touching it. At the same time, patches of their skin looked to be falling and slightly purple and green. The last thing was their eyes, which were pitch black, hiding the pupil and the white of the eyes.

The beasts looked infected with something, and Vincent was sure they had some strange strength rising in them.

***

# Chapter 1738: A Diffrent Shadow.

The robed vampire had managed to summon five large beasts, each of which was around five metres in height. Luckily the stage was quite big, so it didn't take up most of the stadium, but it wasn't something the crowd was expecting to see, that was for sure.

It also looked like Vincent wasn't the only one that could tell these beasts were different. It was easy to tell, and the crowd was a little concerned. However, there were some guesses as to what this possibly could be.

"Are they like shadow beasts? Maybe he created beasts from the shadow? Is that why they look different?" One said.

"Yeah, or maybe he's infused his shadow power with the beasts. It was stated that Quinn could also store things in his shadow, right?"

"So it would make sense, there are things that we just don't know about the shadow."

It was true that the current generation didn't know much about the shadow since the guardians rarely made a public appearance. However, some people here were acquainted with Quinn and knew about shadow power but had never seen something like this before.

"What do you want me to do?" Vicky asked with her hand up against her ear. As soon as she saw what was going on, she knew that she might need to intervene.

"I think the best choice is to hold off for now," Logan replied.

"Don't worry; I'm keeping an eye on everything, and my main priority is making sure that the public is safe."

"At the moment, it doesn't look like they are attempting to attack the crowd, and if we intervene now, others might have opinions about what we are doing."

Hearing this, Vicky didn't know if it was the best choice, but she decided to listen to her husband. From her past experience, more times than not, he knew what he was doing. He had grown up a lot from when the two of them had first met.

"Is this all for me? I have to say I am quite flattered." Vincent smiled. "I would say getting extra help is a little unfair for the contest, don't you think?"

It was true. With this many strong beasts, it looked like the predicted winner might change, especially since some of the robots had already turned towards them.

The league bear-like beast was the first to react to the robot, swiping toward it. The claws sliced right through its body, and as the paw hit the rest of the robot, it smashed it into the ground smashing it to pieces.

It had clearly demonstrated the level of its strength.

"That's a little worrisome." Vincent thought. These beasts look to be at the Demi-god level, not the Demon tier level, but that attack just now was clearly close to the Demon tier level.

"If all of the beasts are like that, I might have to try and hop out of here as soon as possible."

Knowing this, Vincent turned around, but there was already the flying creature from before in his way. The strange eyes on its wings opened up, and fireballs came out toward him. All ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ full.com

Vincent had no choice but to use his blood aura to try to attack them and hit them out of the way. Successfully blocking the attacks. Vincent could feel the strength of the hits, but there was more to worry about than that.

The Large bear-like beast had swiped its hand toward Vincent. For such a large figure, Vincent was surprised by how fast it could move because it was at the same speed as a vampire lord.

"I'm going to have to use a lot more blood aura than this... but then..." Vincent was in the middle of contemplating what to do. It was clear now that this guardian was more concerned with fighting against Vincent than the contest itself.

Just as Vincent was getting ready to extract more blood aura, he could see someone had come to his aid. The other person threw out a fist, which collided with the giant beast and pushed it back, causing it to stumble for a few seconds.

"That's quite the punch you got there." Vincent complemented the other.

"Is that your way of saying thank you, Peter replied, "Anyway, I just don't like others using Quinn's power, and that bear looked a bit smug when he destroyed that robot.

By now, the bear was ready to attack again.

However, this time, it was in some sort of rage mode. Its eyes started to glow, and a shadow started to appear on its back with it. Seeing the shadow from the bear, it looked a bit different from Quinn's.

Quinn's shadow, when used with his abilities, would often give a little purple look, whereas the colour of this shadow was pure black. The shadow from the bear's back started to move until it covered its two claws, constantly moving in place.

The bear went on the attack again, thrusting both claws towards Peter this time. Somewhat worried that this attack would be stronger than the last, Peter also decided to add Qi to his attack.

"If the shadow works the same way as Quinn's, then the Qi should disrupt it, as long as this damn giant bear doesn't know how to use Qi." Peter thought.

"Interesting." The robed figure said, seeing this.

"It seems some people know quite a bit about shadow power, at least the old shadow power. A god slayer's power can be made into their own" The figure mumbled to himself.

"Don't touch it!" Vincent shouted.

Perhaps Vincent was just being cautious, but with this shadow looking different to Quinn's, he wanted to know everything about it before facing it head-on like Peter was about to do.

Hearing this, Peter pulled back at the last second. He dropped his fist and leaned back. As he did so, the bear's claws looked like they were about to miss but suddenly, the shadow that surrounded them extended and was heading right for Peter.

Quickly, Peter managed to lift his arms to protect his head. It was the one rule he had, but that was when the shadow claws went right through his body, and Peter paused in surprise. He had felt nothing.

He didn't feel any kind of pain or was there any visible injury on his body. But he knew that the shadow claws had gone through him, and Vincent had even seen it.

"Hahaha." The robed figure started to laugh aloud seeing this, which only made Vincent worry even more.

It was then that Peter could feel something strange, For the first time in a long time, he could feel a tingling on his skin.

"This feeling. I haven't felt it in a long time, but my skin is a little itchy."

The sun was shining brightly on the event floor, and a Wight wasn't meant to be affected by the sunlight, but Peter was also starting to feel a little hot.

All the creatures started to emit the shadow power they had from within them, which enveloped their mouths, eyes or heads, specifically, whatever parts of their body they would usually use to attack.

"I will warn you all now." The vampire said. "We are just after the one that calls himself Quinn Talen. If anyone gets in our way, you shall pay."

"I think it might be time we jump in, Jessica said to the others, and she thought it was best if everyone used their celestial energy if possible.

"Jake, help the others and take out that Guardian!" Vicky ordered her son through their communication device. Then, listening to his mother, Jake turned to face the guardian and noticed he was doing something strange.

A shadow covered his body like a vortex. They started to rise up and became a tornado of shadows, The five beasts continued to stand guard. Then, when the tornado of shadow faded away, another larger bulkier figure could be seen standing in the guardians place.

He wore a long trench coat but had no shirt underneath, displaying his pale body. His hair was up to his waist, and a marking was branded onto his chest, the marking of a single eye with wings.

The others were waiting for Muka to give the order on what to do, but when turning to her, they could only see her body trembling and her lips quivering a few words.

"That's... Laxmus..."

***

# Chapter 1739: A Diffrent Shadow 2.

Muka was clearly shaken when she saw the person in front of her. After all, she was in slumber for a long time, and although she heard the rumours after she woke up and had even suspected about who the leader of the red vampires could be, there was always a doubt in her mind until this moment.

The result of what had happened to the vampire settlement, the friends and family that she had lost that day, everything was now slowly coming back to her, flashing in her mind like Logan's slides. The others beside her would have asked her what was wrong, but they weren't able to.

Because for some reason, while standing with a smug expression on his face at the centre of the arena, Laxmus was emitting immense pressure. No. one at the scene had ever felt such a pressure before and it was as if the air around them had gotten denser, making it harder for them to even stand.

Some people in the crowd had even instantly fainted from this pressure, and this was beginning to spread panic and fear among many of the crowd because everyone knew this person was dangerous.

"Laxmus, that was the vampire who Quinn fought against, but got escaped at the last second, and this guy also had similar powers as Quinn." Peter thought.

Peter also started to think about the things Quinn had mentioned. And he noticed that the marking on Laxmus's chest certainly looked like a marking that belonged to another celestial.

It wasn't exactly the same as what Peter had on himself, but he could judge what the marking on Laxmus's chest was. In fact, Peter could feel the energy radiating off him, and it was almost as if a celestial was standing in front of them himself.

There is no time for playing games, and I can't continue to disguise myself as the Crazy Bloodlord anymore. It's time to transform and fight with all I have. Peter looked around and noticed that most of the crowd was still in shock, and just then, Logan projected an emergency announcement.

Logan wasn't willing to take any chances. Soon, the black AI robots appeared at the exit, and loud warning alarms went off with lights flashing red.

"Now that's not a nice welcome." Laxmus said, somehow portraying his voice loudly so all the others could hear. It was as if he was speaking through a microphone. "Am I really that much of a threat?"

The AI robots that were left on the field had also gone to protect those in the crowd in case the Red Vampire leader attacked the latter or if there were any stray attacks. As for Jake and Isac, they stepped close to each other, staring warily at Laxmus, wondering what would happen next.

He was surrounded by the strange beasts that seemed somewhat strong, and hopefully, they could solve this all without a fight.

Peter transformed himself and stepped forward. His head-tail came out, the red powers running through his body, and special black hardened scales now covered his arms.

"Why... why do I still feel the burning... and my skin is itching even after transformation."

"Will you look at that!" Laxmus chuckled upon seeing how the others had reacted after seeing him, "I was just after the fake Quinn Talen, but it looks like there is another surprise for me."

"I guess this is a good day for me to get more celestial energy for myself. But first, there is something else I need to show you people."

Laxmus glanced towards the crowd from the corner of his eye, and Jake noticed this. Instantly, he jumped in the direction that Laxmus had glanced and had formed a large metallic spear in his hand while he was still in the air.

Then, with his telekinesis power, Jake threw it at an incredible speed, aiming to finish off the red vampire leader.

But before the spear could reach Laxmus's neck, one of the large beasts, a two-headed snake, opened up both of its mouths. What appeared inside the mouths was a seemingly bottomless hole filled with endless shadows.

The spear went right through one of the snake's mouths, and in the next instant, it came out from its other mouth, and went right back towards Jake.

Landing on the ground, Jake stomped the ground and was able to create a thick wall in front of himself and was able to avoid being hurt by his own attack just in time as the spear struck the wall.

"These beasts are annoying, and I might be imagining things, but it looks like they can also use the shadow power!" Jake thought.

It was then that when he looked up over his head, Jake saw another vortex of large shadows appearing right over him, and it was doing exactly what he was afraid of, heading in the direction of the crowd.

"What are you guys doing!?" Jake clamoured at the others in the arena, "We're the most powerful people here, but I'm the only one making a move. Are you people afraid of him?!"

The thing was, the others were indeed fighting back, Even Vicky tried to come down to join the fight, but the shadow beasts reacted, each going towards the other contestants, and now they were struggling against these beasts.

Due to each of them having strange powers and the beasts being stronger than they usually would, this wasn't something they could take care of straight away. However, that was when the shadow successfully engulfed a group of people, covering them completely.

"Haha, that's it! That's it. Feel the burden, feel the pain we have had to deal with for years, and see how you deal with it!" Laxmus shouted.

Eventually, the vortex of shadow rose, revealing the trapped group of around six people. They looked unharmed, with not even a single scratch on their body, but they started to scream in pain a few seconds later.

"AHHH, it HURTS!!! IT HURTS!!!!!"

They were screaming at the top of their lungs, so much that it felt like the back of their throats were cut. Some of the others were even scratching their own skin with their nails until it ripped, trying to do whatever it took to get rid of the pain.

This... Vincent's eyes widened. "I have seen this reaction before... it's the same skill that Arthur used against the vampires, but how can he use it against Humans?"

"Has he somehow altered the power and changed the skill to work against humans?"

It was a shocking thought, and at the same time. Laxmus had done it so easily. Previously, when Quinn used his shadow eater skill against other vampires, they needed to be in a weakened state for it to work. But Laxmus, on the other hand, was able to use the skill on his whim and even against the humans.

Judging by the way Peter keeps looking at his skin. That bear might have done something similar to him. Wights can usually stay in the sun just fine, but he is also suffering the pain from it for the first time.

There was one good thing though, and that was the fact that with the other contestants, Vicky and the others dealing with the beasts, Peter, in his transformed state, managed to run past them all, and he was making his way straight to Laxmus who was still laughing in joy at the pain the humans were in.

He soon noticed the ball of energy coming toward him. Then, without doing much, a large shadow portal opened up a few metres in front of Laxmus, and a giant fist came straight out of it.

It was a solid black, spiralling with strange energy all around it. It wasn't quite a vampire aura, it was hard to be exactly what it was, and the fist was gigantic. The knuckles covered more than the whole of Peter's body.

Unafraid, Peter went to throw out a punch with all his strength. When it hit the giant shadow fist, it didn't budge. Peter could not push forward, and his hand remained there in place.

For the first time in a long time, his strength felt like it had done nothing.

"Everyone has only known the shadow powers of Quinn Talen and Arthur."

"However, I am the original user of this ability, and I have had a lot of time to gather all the shadow I needed to do things that none of you could even imagine." Laxmus spoke.

His smug expression was still the same, if not more intense. He wanted to talk more, but he was cut short when he felt more celestial energy ascending.

Glancing behind Peter, he saw a few others standing there with celestial energy. Muka, Lucia and the rest had descended onto the battlefield,

"No matter what... we have to stop him," Muka said, clenching her fist and taking a fighting stance.

"No one ever wants to fight me on my own. Laxmus smiled. "That's okay because there are many more things the shadow can do!"

Saying this, he spread out his arms, and in the next instant, ten more portals appeared beside him, and out of them, ten other vampires at the lord level had stepped out.

"Greet my Guardians."
