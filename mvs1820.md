# Chapter 1820: Act like one. (Part 2)

The chaos ensued in section three, but eventually, things were starting to die down because the remaining guests had decided to hide. It was a large ship with plenty of room, and equipment among other things. Since surrendering wasn't an option, they kept quiet, not making a noise and revealing themselves.

The enemies had now dealt with most of the noisy guests that had continued to fight back, but they didn't leave because they had yet to find who they were actually looking for.

The attackers soon stepped inside the large bar area. There was a group of ten of them. The three in front held swords while the others had guns ready to give them back up when needed.

One of the gunmen suddenly saw a person move from under the table and immediately shot them, and the others followed and put several holes in the tables, instantly killing most of the guests hiding under them.

"We aren't to kill them unless we confirm who they are first!" One at the front said aloud.

Just as they were being told off from the side, two females in black dresses appeared in front of them. One of them kicked the weapon out of the enemy's hand, while the other hit the hand away before using her palm to strike the chin of another. The movements were quick, and the main goal was to get the weapons the enemy was using.

Both of the girls, Wince and Ceril had no hesitation as they slashed the bodies in front of them. Then holding thier bodies in place, they charged towards the gunmen using them as shields. When getting close, they pushed the bodies, throwing them on top of the others.

Before they could recover and get off the ground, both of the females slashed their necks, drawing a strange bluish blood killing them on the spot.

"This is our fault." Ceril started huffing and panting.

The two girls had cut off part of thier dress and covered their faces. They looked towards the chaos that was continuing, but it looked like it was coming to an end.

The attackers with their guns had quickly been able to subdue to a room full of people. The only one left fighting was Nog, who was up against the trident user. Nog had done well, he was fast strong and powerful and had taken on a group of ten before running into this man.

Still, there was no match between the two.

"You are still standing, but can't you see, we have already taken over the ship. I thought the Marpo ship was meant to be impossible to take over?" The man asked, with his hands raised.

He then shoved the trident forward and three jets of water started to wrap around each other hitting Nog straight in the stomach and sending him flying back and crashing into the several tables in the bar area until he had eventually stopped.

Everyone who had been captured, injured and still alive were watching, thinking that this was the end of thier lives.

"You have no idea what you are doing." Nog said getting up and coughing blood. His clothes had been ripped off, and his whole body was bruised full of broken bones. "If the captain was here, he would have beaten you all."

"And even if you don't believe that. Now that you have touched this place, the real owner of the Marpo-Cruise will come for you no matter where you are!" Nog smiled.

The words he spoke were his truth, he was satisfied to know after death all of these people would be dealt with, he was just upset that he wouldn't be there to see it.

Around fifty of the attackers in strange masks had been defeated and the rest had gathered behind the man with the trident. There was no longer any need for them to search the rest of the area, as everywhere apart from one had been searched.

The one with the trident had placed his hand next to his ear, to report this to the other teams. There was a response from a couple of them, but from one there was no word what so ever.

"That's strange. Is there really someone on this ship that could have wiped them out. Perhaps this captain this guy spoke of. Although I find it unlikely... but I guess we still haven't found her." He mumbled to himself.

He and the others walked forward, entering the large bar area that covered an entire hall. It was the last place that they had yet to check and where the last of the resistance currently was at.

"You are in quite the situation to use such words when you can't even stand. They will come after us. Very well, then let them come after us. I am willing to take that gamble!" The man said, pointing his trident towards Nog once more.

Water could be seen gathering at the tip, and it was unsure even for Nog himself if he could take another hit.

"Wait!" The pink-haired female ran out and stood in front of the trident. "It's me you want." She said taking off her make-shift mask and revealing herself.

"Now. This would have been far easier wouldn't it?" The man asked.

"If you had just come out from the beginning, then everything would have been fine. Did you really think that you were protected and safe here?"

Wince didn't say anything, she just clenched her fists while a large vein on her forehead could be seen. Her teeth were grinding back and forth but she knew there was nothing that she could do.

Two men held her by her arms as they went to take her away.

"NOOO!" Ceril shouted, revealing herself from her hiding spot, just behind one of the flipped tables. "Please, someone help her!"

Her eyes were full of tears, but she herself didn't act because she knew she couldn't do it alone. She couldn't fight them all on her own. All she could do, was continue to scream and ask for help.

The other attackers were searching the place, to see if there was anyone else that might still be hiding, when one of them had come across a certain individual lying on the table sleeping, the sound of snoring could be heard so it was clear he was alive.

"Sir, what should we do with the guests on board, including this one?" The attacker asked.

"Get rid of them all." The leader replied.

"WAIT NOO!" Wince shouted. "I came with you, you got what you want, why are you doing this, You don't have to do this! Please!"

No amount of begging would work, she now realised this as the soldiers got ready to use thier guns, but that's when her sights went to the one who had a gun held right to his head.

"YOU!" Wince shouted. "You're a god right! You proved it to me. You told me about all those things you did."

"So do them now! I saw how much pain you were in, you were in so much pain because you said you couldn't save your old friends, right? Right!" She continued to scream.

"Please, help us, help us... You can help people, you can do something this time, to help others!! So please... wake the Fu#k up!" The last words were screamed at the top of her lungs the sound resounded in the entire place, almost echoing but there seemed to be no response.

The sound of the guns in the room were heard charging up, and one was pointed directly to the man head on the table. Wince looked to him, her last hope, his life was going to end like that, until she saw the man's hand on the gun.

She hadn't seen him move, she just saw that the person on the table was now holding onto the gun. The attacker tried to pull away, he used his whole strength but it couldn't move no matter what.

"So much screaming, it's really starting to hurt my head." A voice was heard from the table.

That's when the attacker noticed that the man's nose on the table started to twitch.

"I smell blood."

***

# Chapter 1821: The Captain.

Keeping his hand on the gun, Quinn stood up from his seat. He had wrapped the palm of his hand around the muzzle. He then clutched the barrel and pulled the man's arms as he stood up, and seeing this, all eyes in the area were on him.

"Let go! Let go, or I'll shoot!" The man shouted. Panic was evident in his tone.

Upon hearing this, the others had stopped what they were ordered to do and were looking at the sudden turn of events. Wince's throat hurt from all the shouting and crying, but now, she thought it was worth it because 'he' was now awake.

Nog, standing not too far off, was breathing heavily. He could barely stand on his feet but somehow managed to hold composure because he didn't want to look weak.

"These guys, they are no joke. I remember he did that trick before but will it work on these guys? Can he really do anything?"

"Either way, it doesn't matter as long as he can hold them off until the captain arrives. If need be... I'll help him without hesitation either!" Nog thought while focusing on recovering his strength as quickly as possible.

The wounds and bruises on his body began to heal as the horn on his head pulsated and changed colours.

"Is this the person you were screaming at before?" The Commander of the attackers asked.

"This person is going to help you? Have you gone mad? Very well, let's see what he can do. Get rid of him"

Hearing the order, the man holding the gun pushed the trigger, realising the energy beam. However, nothing happened as silence descended on the bar. Quinn stood there in no pain or injury on his body. They had expected the energy beam to go through his hand and into his head, but the beam never came out.

"Is it broken?" the man wondered and pulled the trigger again and again. The side of the gun lit up like it usually would, but the energy beam he wanted never came out.

As for what Quinn was doing, he was matching the energy produced by the gun with his own Qi. A while ago, he noticed that some Pure members used guns which created Qi bullets.

It had made Quinn wonder if he could use the third stage of Qi like that of a blood bullet? It would be an almost invisible strong and fast attack. Now that he recalled it, he had the chance to implement it practically, and it looked like he could get the answer to this question here, as the two energies matched with one another and cancelled out the effects.

The gun was made quite well, as he was surprised it didn't break, but it also worked well as a good practice over realising his Qi as soon as the man pressed the trigger.

"It's a shame you're wearing those masks." Quinn said, with a hiccup in between.

"Otherwise, I might have made you shoot your own friends."

In the next instant, he tightened his grip around the muzzle, and broke the whole thing, crushing it, he threw it on the ground. The man looked dazed. Everything happened so fast that he couldn't even react and now was unsure what to do.

Still, they were strong and trained in combat, so mustering all his confidence, he went to throw a punch.

Quinn easily blocked it by smacking it away and kicked the man's legs causing him to fall.

The next second, Quinn pressed his foot on the man's chest. Immediately, the others pulled out their guns and pointed them toward Quinn.

"Why... why isn't he using that strange power that he used before? He can control all of them to do his bidding, right?" Wince thought. She hadn't caught Quinn's whisper from earlier.

The main problem was the masks that the others were wearing, and it was unsure if it would work against such people in the first place.

"I would have liked to have tested a few things on you," Quinn said, nearly losing his balance and falling off the man. "However, I'm not feeling the best today, so I need to end this quickly."

The Commander laughed, and so did his men. By then, noticing that the firing had stopped and people were laughing, some guests were peeking out of their hiding spots to look over at the scene. Even Tom, who was lying on the floor but still alive, had opened his eyes.

"Hey!" Quinn shouted, looking at Wince. "Don't you remember what I said? I'm a god of blood, and these guys have spilt a lot of it."

Lifting his hands, the dead guests blood and all that was on the floor started to rise up. The blood of the dead was being sucked out of their bodies and slowly rose above the floor. They were in a large area, so it was bizarre for them to see the blood everywhere in the air like rain drops.

As they witnessed the scene, the attackers started to panic, and a frown formed on the Commander's face.

"How is someone able to do such things?" Wince thought.

Nog's mouth was left wide open upon witnessing what was going on.

He had met many people on their trips, but no one could do something like this. Combined with what the person had shown before and his strength, Nog was starting to believe that this person might even be stronger than the captain.

"What are you doing? Stop him, fire!" the Commander ordered as he clutched his trident and pointed it towards Quinn. Immediately, all the enemies started to fire at Quinn.

Multiple lasers came toward him, but before they could reach him, the blood droplets suddenly amassed in the air in front of Quinn, forming a wall and blocking every incoming attack. The blood wall continued to move, and even when the Commander used the trident to fire out a jet stream of water, more blood would gather and block it.

It was hard for the attackers to seewhat was going on, as the blood kept accumulating, blocking the attacks from all directions as it had almost created a ball around Quinn.

In the end, seeing their attacks turning out useless, they stopped firing. But they didn't know this decision would just hasten their annihilation.

"Okay, now it's my turn," Quinn's words resounded throughout the room.

He moved his hand down, and all the blood in the air turned into something similar to the blood bullet skill. In an instant, it went through all the attackers, breaking through the armour they were wearing, hitting their heads, and killing them on the spot.

Before anyone could react, everyone witnessed about one hundred fifty bodies fall to the ground, all apart from one, the Commander. He stood there in disbelief as he looked at all of his men.

"You are an interesting one." Quinn smiled.

"On this whole ship, there wasn't one person with celestial energy, so I was losing hope, and then one of you came right to my doorstep."

Moving just his fingers, the blood from before and the new blood spilt from the dead bodies started to gather and condense into the palm of Quinn's hand and turned into a solid red ball.

"Wait! Who are you? Maybe you and my master can talk!" The Commander said, now frightened.

The situation had completely turned on its head.

Everyone thought that it was clear they had the upper side, yet they came across just one person with so much power that he alone turned the tables.

Wince, who was being held, noticed that Quinn could even attack them without hurting any others.

Somehow, her stroke of luck had worked, and she was now more confident than ever that she had found the right person.

"Thank you, thank you so much!" She couldn't help but tear up at the glimpse of hope in front of her.

"I'm sorry," Quinn replied to the Commander.

"But I already know how to deal with your type. Things never change, and I'm not going to give you a chance. In the first place, the easiest way to make them come to me is by taking you out."

He thrust his arm forward, and out from the red ball of energy, a large spike came out so fast that it pierced the Commander's heart before he could even react. The Celestial energy from his body got drained and went straight to Quinn, but the amount was minuscule, and when he retreated the spike, the Commander fell to the floor, dead.

There was silence for a few moments. It took time for the guests to process what was happening until a few words came out.

"Thank you! Thank you! You saved us" A guest cheered.

Applause resounded throughout the room as people shouted tears of gratitude to the person in front of them. Upon seeing all of this, it was hard to say it didn't make Quinn happy it was a good feeling. a Just then, several staff members, along with Sil, rushed into the casino through the large hole that the attacker had created.

"As I thought, I didn't have to worry about anything after all." Sil smiled upon seeing Quinn going back to his seat and sitting down.

For Nog though, as soon as he saw Sil and the others, he rushed over immediately and got down on one knee, not in front of him, but rather to the large man next to him the Dalki.

"Captain, please instruct us about what to do next!" Nog asked.

"Captain? What? This Dalki is the captain?"

***

# Chapter 1822: Not my Problem.

Because of the sudden attack the ship suffered a lot of damage that needed urgent repair. So instead of continuing the flight path as planned to its next destination, the Captain decided to halt the ship's advancement, and instructed the staff to commence emergency repairs all over the ship.

However, because the amount of damage on the ship was too much, there wasn't really enough for backup for them to get it back up to how it was, so they had called for help from the main branch, the Marpo Headquarters. In the response, the Captain was told they would send out a fleet to do repairs, but it would take a while for them to arrive.

By the time the fleet comes, the Captain was instructed to figure out the number of lives lost on the ship and the amount of damage done.

There were times when this ship was attacked, but one or two guests would get injured or maybe even unfortunately killed. However, never anything like this had transpired before and the whole matter required urgent investigation to find out the root cause.

However, there was still the question of who would take responsibility for such a thing happening? It was hard to say.

The guests on the cruise had their personal problems they had to deal with, so it would be hard for any of them to act, which was why they had pointed most of the anger toward the attackers, but this led to the most important question; once again, just who were the attackers and why had they attacked since it was clear they weren't random space pirates?

A meeting had been called in the command room, from the Captain no less, and the people attending it were the two sisters, Nog, Sil and Quinn. They were all now in the same room, sitting at a round table across from each other.

But the mood was strange in the room, to say the least. When Sil learned that Dalki was Captain, he didn't know how to react. The good news was it didn't look like their lead would be getting off the ship anytime soon.

Earlier, the Dalki captain, known as Doguth, had asked if they could meet at some point and would call them after he was done assessing the situation. Since Sil could see that Quinn was in no state to reply himself, he had agreed.

The two of them went into a room to relax for the day until Quinn had finally recovered. Then, Sil sat down and explained everything that had ensued during the attack, while Quinn had next to no recollection of what he had done, only bits and pieces here and there.

It didn't matter though, because while walking back to their room, plenty of people had informed Sil exactly what Quinn had done, while thanking the then tipsy Quinn.

When telling the story back to him, for the first time after a long period, Quinn's face carried a tinge of red out of embarrassment, which deepened as Sil continued.

At last, the two of them were eventually called by the Captain, which had brought them to the situation they were in now.

The Dalki stood up, beginning the meeting. It was strange for the two humans to see one act so civil and understanding.

Although it wasn't too strange for Quinn because looking at the Dalki Captain reminded him of Borden.

"First, I want to start this meeting by thanking the two of you." The Dalki gestured towards them with a hand and a slight bow.

"I have seen what the blonde man can do first hand, and I have heard numerous reports from Nog and others of what you have done."

"Without the two of you, the number of lives we would have lost on this ship would have been much more."

In truth. Sil didn't want the Dalki to treat them nicely because it made it harder for them to ask for what they wanted. Sil wanted to find out why a Dalki had an ability and how it was still alive. They also needed to get information about Earth from him, and if he weren't going to say anything, then they would have to use force and find out from him, which wouldn't be easy to do if they became friendlv with him.

Sil and Quinn's plan before coming here was to hear what the meeting was about first and then act according to the circumstances.

"It's no problem. I don't even remember what I did in the first place!" Quinn quiped, half smiling, which received some giggles from both Wince and Ceril.

"Now, I have called you all here because we have to find out why this unknown enemy attacked the Marpo Cruise. According to Nog, it looked like the group's commander was after you." Doguth pointed at Wince.

"So, it would be best if vou can please explain."

Wince turned silent for a second and had her head held down. That was when her sister Cyril held her hand and nodded.

"We should tell them we need his help, right?" She added.

Sitting up straight, Wince also nodded and, after taking a deep breath, she started to explain.

"I will explain everything from the beginning so you can better understand our situation. I am Wince Trail. Princess of the Meremerial race, and currently, we are on the run.

"Our planet has always been split into two factions, two groups of people that believe they hold the right to rule our race. However, it has been impossible for one side to rule the other due to our powers being even."

The start of the conversation played a lot of similarities with the current situation on Earth, so Quinn was slightly interested. Still, as he stated before, he wasn't interested in getting involved in anyone else's affairs.

"On one side, they have a powerful god that supports them. He grants them strange powers to fight us, and on our side, we have a Legendary beast, the Hydra, controlled by my father, the King."

"One day, my father and the legendary beast suddenly went missing. Even after a long search and many days, there was no news of him."

"In the end, some of our people began to believe that they were dead, and because of that the tide of power shifted, allowing the other faction to take over and get rid of our army."

"Because of all this, my sister and I had no choice but to run away, but they continued to chase us. They wish to eliminate our bloodline so there can never be an uprising, but before that, they want us alive. As for why he wishes us alive, it's because our blood will unlock the Royal Room. It will allow him access to weapons and powerful weapons and items, strengthening the other faction."

The four in the room understood what was going on. To be honest, it was a tale heard many times, just in different ways. An uprising, a betrayal or just two factions colliding and one side getting rid of the other.

"This is why we boarded the Marpo-Cruise!" Syril explained. "We are looking for powerful warriors to help us fight back. Our people have been made into slaves or tortured just for supporting us. We have to set them free and reclaim our world."

It was then that Quinn stood up from his seat.

"Look, I'm sorry, but like I said before, I don't really want to or have the time to get involved. Whenever I get involved, people end up dying anyway, and I need to get back to Earth."

"So if no one in this room can help us get back to Earth, we will leave this place and continue on our way."

"It's not like this doesn't concern you," Wince chimed in. "If they capture us and get their hands on those treasures, it will be destructive for the entire galaxy. You have seen what type of people you are dealing with, right? And we are not asking you to help us for free. You are free to have the treasures for yourself if you are successful, we just want our people to be free. So we beg you, on behalf of an entire race, please help us out."

The look in her eyes annoyed Quinn because somewhere in his heart, he wanted to help them out. It was in his nature; it was just who he was, but he had to prioritise who was more important. So, without saying a yes or no, Quinn walked out of the room, with Sil quickly following him.

They walked down the hallway until Quinn eventually stopped and placed his hands on the side of his head.

"Hey, not to add to the stress of the situation, but are we going to help them out?" Sil asked.

"Now you too?" Quinn replied but noticed something strange.

Beside him, Sil suddenly had a strange look on his face, and when listening closely, Quinn noticed the former's heart was beating slightly taster.

"What's wrong?" He asked.

Sil looked behind before replying while scratching the back of his head.

"Well, the thing is... you know how she said that her father and the Hydra went missing? Ahem, well, uh, do you remember that trident that I have?"

***

# Chapter 1823: Guilty.

As soon as Quinn heard the words coming out of Sil's mouth, he stopped him there and quickly used his celestial energy to cover the two of them in his white space. Although he hadn't yet fully recovered his celestial energy after the practice, there was enough to secure the location. He believed it was important that no one else ends up hearing what Sil was saying.

"Sil... please tell me it isn't true?" Quinn asked, still surprised by what Sil was trying to imply.

Using his powers, Sil opens the portal to reveal the glorious trident he used in his battle against Athos. Admittedly, it was more elegant than the commander's, but on closer inspection, both the trident seemed to have similar craftsmanship and design. And upon seeing this, it only added more worry to Quinn's mind.

"I'm sorry, Quinn, but you have to understand my point of view," Sil said.

"When I landed on the planet, there was nothing but water, and then this damn giant Hydra-looking fish came out of nowhere and started attacking me."

"What do you think anyone would do in that situation? It was clearly at the level of a demon-tier beast and a strong one as well. So I thought that it would make a great weapon."

"There were plenty of times when I would land on a pallet and kill beasts and demon-tier beasts, so this was no different. How could I have imagined this would complicate things in future."

So far, the story seemed quite fair, and Quinn was with Sil on this one. He would have done the same thing.

"Anyway, in the middle of the fight, this muscular old man with a white beard came out of nowhere. He was also the same."

"Without saying anything or listening to me, he started to attack along with the Hydra. I had no clue what was happening, but the man kept yammering about this Yanny guy sending me to kill the beast."

"I have to admit it was a really tough fight, but what was even more impressive was that the man could transform the demon tier beast into this weapon right here."

"Furthermore, it had the same replication ability, allowing one trident to become many, just like Hydra's many heads."

"It was clear that this man was going to take me out, so it was either him or me, and after he disappeared, I took the spear, and it's been like this ever since. But I won't lie, this trident has been one of my best and most favoured demon tier weapons because it helped me gain an advantage in countless battles after that." Sil was shaking his head as he thought back to the fight.

It certainly was one of his most challenging ones, especially for not going against a God Slayer or a Celestial. It was almost as if the demon-tier beast and the man were more on the level of a god slayer, but that wasn't the important bit now.

"I have to admit... I feel a bit guilty." Sil added, "Ultimately, it's because of me that her family and the people on the planet are being turned into slaves. Can't we help them?"

Quinn's eyebrows furrowed. If he were honest, he would have preferred Sil to keep the story to himself, but he understood why it was eating him up inside and why he felt the need to tell someone.

For Quinn though, this story just made it harder for him to be selfish. They had absolutely no responsibility or reason to get involved in this, unlike with the Amra race, but now Sil had presented a reason and not a simple one either.

"If it's really such a big deal, maybe one of us can continue to focus on finding a way to get back to the Earth while the other helps them out? I don't think there's a need for the two of us." Sil suggested.

While thinking about it, Quinn didn't really want to split up with Sil. Splitting up last time didn't turn out to be the best decision, even if the two were titans in terms of power. Hearing what Sil had suggested though, did give him an idea.

"Maybe there is a way." Quinn sighed.

"The commander for before had a marking, that means there's definitely a Celestial on that planet. So that's one way of us getting back. Then there's the treasure for helping the princess."

"Honestly, we don't know which side is the right one, but we have to be selfish in this situation."

"The princess has promised us rewards, not to mention we're the reason their race is in danger, so let's help them, and with the rewards, there might be a way back through them, and there is also a third reason."

"If you've been to the Meremerial planet before, it means we're heading in the right direction."

"Right now, the best way to return to Earth is to retrace your steps, and maybe your ship will kick in and pick something up again. So that's three reasons we should help." Quinn nodded with his arms folded.

"I mean, we didn't really need three reasons, but if that's what you need to convince yourself to help these people, then do it, Quinn. I knew you were going to help them anyway." Sil smiled.

"Maybe I should keep this trident away, so no one sees it? Otherwise, maybe both sides will be after us."

Although Sil said it jokingly about the bad luck that Quinn was having lately, this was a big red flag for them.

After getting out of the Celestial space, Quinn decided not to use his celestial energy freely. After all, they were possibly meeting another celestial, and after defeating the last one, although he was more confident than before, he didn't wish to do something reckless.

They were back in the hallway right now, and the two of them decided to turn around and head back to the meeting room. Only the sisters were in the meeting room, and it seemed like the Captain, and his manager had left the room after Quinn and Sil stormed off a few minutes ago. Even the sisters were about to leave when Quinn suddenly stepped in and made an announcement before they did.

"The two of us, we have decided to help you, Princess," His words surprised everyone in the room.

They were only a few words but were enough to bring the two sisters to tears. They turned to each other, locking hands and began to jump up and down for joy. They were truly happy, and Quinn also smiled at this sight, knowing he was the reason for their hope.

Soon after, both sisters ran up to Sil and Quinn, giving them a big, tight hug.

"Thank you... thank you! We promise that we will forever be in your debt after this is over. We will do our best to support you if there is a problem or anything you need."

The group didn't waste time, and it was mainly due to Quinn. He wanted them to move on and not add any more delays to their original plan. So they decided to take Sil's ship as it could comfortably fit everyone inside and head to Meremerial planet.

Both of them didn't quite know what they were expecting, but the sisters would tell them everything they needed to know along the way. However, just before they left, surprisingly, there were two figures standing near the ship's ramp.

"Hey, what are you two doing?" Sil asked.

It was the Nog and his Dalki Captain Doguth. They were notified by the other staff members of these four heading to the docking area, and after a small discussion amongst themselves, they headed for Sil's ship.

Seeing the confused expression on Sil and Quinn's faces, the Captain clarified. "These people destroyed my ship that I have given my life to. I don't care too much about the princess's vendetta."

"I want to avenge this ship against the people who did this, so they would never consider doing it again. Which is why we decided that the two of us will be coming." Doguth, stated.

Sil stood on the ramp, refusing to budge. He didn't particularly like the fact that these two were going on his ship until Quinn pulled him by his shoulder and to the side.

"I know you said that Dalki knows nothing about Earth, but we also know nothing about him. If the Dalki are still alive and they have abilities, then we should gather information about them as well so that we can be ready for anything."

"Maybe after this thing, it will bring us closer together, and he'll explain to us."

A large huff came out from Sil, which showed his displeasure at the idea. Seeing a middle-aged man act like this was strange, but Sil had improved vastly from the last time Quinn saw him, so he didn't really say anything.

"Fine" Sil said while walking off. "But if you guys betray us attack us, or pull any of that crap, then I'm going to deal with you all personally."

Walking up the ramp, Nog and Doguth entered the ship, and everyone soon embarked on their journey to the Meremerial race planet.

—— —— ——

Not long after the group had left, a fleet of ships arrived from none other than the Marpo headquarters. A man stepped out of one of the ships and onto the large Cruise ship. After observing the ship's state, the man shook his head as a frown appeared on his face, and his eyes began to glow red.

"What dared to create this mess?!"

***

# Chapter 1824: A Red Deal.

After the Great War against the Dalki, the planet Earth lost most of its landmass, leading to a significant rise in water level and even less land for the populace to live on. To resolve this problem, Logan built a city above the sea, and the Pure came up with a different solution.

Cruising through the waves as if they were nothing was a gigantic city on a ship. It was enormous, as if someone had attached ten battleships and built a city on them. On top of that, there were more ships around it, ahead, to the left, to the right, at the front and behind. And all of them were moving at the same and constant speed to protect the large ship at any point and time.

However, this wasn't just an ordinary ship. It was the Pure's base. This ship city of Pure, and their solution to the crisis that was on Earth. This enormous ship, which could be best described as a floating city. It looked like bits and pieces which had been put together, rather than a singular made ship. There were no restrictions for people to live there. But here, there were mostly those that supported Pure. Eighty percent of the human population currently on this floating city ship had no Ability as this was their believed philosophy.

Only those that had recently switched sides still had their ability, but they chose not to use it and were kept under meticulous watch. However, those that didn't wish to be left defenceless had the option to join the Pure Military, and in return, they would be taught the ways of Qi.

Small spaceships would board the large vessels from time to time for various reasons. For example, if they were here to trade with port cities linked to Pure, the small ships would land on the helipad at the front of the enormous ship to deliver supplies and Crystal from other planets.

It was a well-built society on board the ship, and they had done well, protecting the people for a while now, unlike Green City, which seemed to be having problems as of late, being targeted by the very vampires that they were trying to protect.

On board the large floating city, on the top floor of one of the highrise buildings, there was a high-class restaurant decorated primarily with golden and red shades. But right now, the restaurant was empty because it was cleared for a crucial meeting.

Three figures were sitting at a fairly large square table. They were the leaders of the Pure. To the left was the red-headed macular man with scars all over his body, Chris, or Agent One. Then to the right, there was Agent four, with his glasses.

Both were sitting down with a straight back, waiting for someone. Then, there was a man who looked to be in his middle thirties. He had a black beard reaching up to his moustache and black hair on the top of his head.

As for his attire, he wore a tight robe and a belt with two blades on its sides. This man was the leader of Pure and the one known as Zero.

Just then, the gates of the huge hall opened, and two figures stepped in. The three men looked up, albeit they remained seated.

"It's great to meet the Queen herself in person finally!" Zero said with a smile to the two ladies walking toward the table.

These were none other than the Dhampir Queen Erin and the second Dhampir, Flora. The ladies bowed a little to show their mutual respect and took the seats opposite Zero.

"I'm sure you know I am a heavily wanted person, which is why I could not meet you before, but it is good that after working together for a long time, we're finally meeting face to face."

"Even during my time in Pure, I had never met you... so this really does count as a first." Erin replied.

There was tension on the table, as it was easy to tell that Chris wasn't happy about this at all. He had his arms crossed, and the frown on his face showed it quite easily. His attitude was annoying to Flora because she wouldn't let someone disrespect the queen like that, but she chose to remain silent for now.

"It's far-fetched to say that we have been working together." Zero replied. "More or less, the two of us just happened to have a common enemy. So please tell me, what brings you here?"

Erin had initially been asked to remove her weapons before entering the room, but of course, she refused. This meeting in itself was a gamble for her. It wouldn't have bothered her earlier, but now there were only two of them, and they were at the heart of someone else's faction.

As usual, Erin's aggressive nature allowed them to have their way, and they entered the room like so.

"You wish to take out Green city, but with the Vampire Corps supporting them, it's nearly impossible for you to do so. Which is why I suggest we team up for real and take them out together."

Zero tapped his finger on the table for a few seconds before giving his reply.

"You are only two people. I was hoping you wouldn't assume I don't know that you no longer have an army. Yes, you are strong, but I doubt just you two would count for much against the enemies."

"I feel like you two coming here was more for protection rather than aggression, isn't that right?"

These words made Flora nervous because, in many ways, Zero was right.

"Because we have more to offer than just us two," Erin, on the other hand, wasn't bothered by Zero's mocking tone. She pulled out the red heart and held it in her hand for everyone to see.

Flora, who was by her side, was stunned to see this. When Erin said she had a plan, she never suspected this. This was an item that everyone was looking for, and they had made many sacrifices to get their hands on it. Was she going to give it away just like that?

"I'm sure you know what it is. In return for the red heart, we ask to join Pure. I admit that our position no longer makes us equal, so just let us be part of your group. If you wish to get rid of Green city or the vampire corps, then so be it.

"However, if you try to betray me after taking this red heart, then I will not leave this planet until I have sliced your head off and fed it to all your children," Erin said with a straight face.

"Unfortunately, I don't have children, not anymore." Zero shrugged his shoulders.

"Nonetheless, I will accept your offer. Agent Four takes the red crystals and shows the queen and the princess to their new abodes."

"Please make them feel welcomed and allow them to use any of the training facilities as they wish, and if they would like to meet me, and discuss anything, give them a direct line."

Letting out a long sigh, Agent four did as he asked and walked over, but he soon had a hop in his step as he approached the red Crystal. When he stood opposite the two, he stopped for a second, being cautious. He was reluctant to take it from the blond dhampir at the start, but when she placed it on the table, he was a bit more inclined to do so.

Picking it up, and feeling it in his hands, he began to look at the item from every angle he could. Without a doubt this was the real deal, it was the red heart that was so highly sought after.

"With the armour, and this, things are falling into place." Agent four thought.

When they finally left the room, Chris couldn't control himself and let out his frustration.

"Why are we working with her?!" Chris asked.

"I understand when we supported them, even collaborated with them, but taking her in as one of our own? Where have your morals gone?"

Zero didn't say anything and just stood up and headed towards the door.

"You know what she did, right? You know what she did to him!!" Chris shouted, which finally had the effect he wanted because Zero turned around and looked directly at Chris.

"Don't you dare mention him!" Zero said in a heavy low tone that vibrated his own chest. Instantly, a tremendous amount of energy radiated off his body, and all the tables and chairs in the room started to float from where they were before quickly falling back down onto the ground.

"If everything goes as intended and planned, then there won't be a problem no matter what happens. You have to keep your eyes on the end goal and put all your focus on it."

"Then, all the hiccups along the way won't matter. What happened before involving her was a hiccup at most, and there might be more to come, but we will push through."

"Besides, now that the Red heart is in our hands, don't you want to find out why the others want this thing so badly?" Zero asked. "Now, come... let's see what this can do."

# Chapter 1825: A God's fear!

Sil's ship was state of the art, at least it was when he had last left earth, so it was relatively fast, but at the same time, according to others, quite slow as well. In fact, it had already been two days of space travelling, and they had yet to reach the planet that they were heading for.

At the moment, Quinn had even regained the ability to re-enter the celestial space, but he decided that now wouldn't be the best time. If he did return, he wanted to have an impact. Returning now would just catch more unwanted attention from others, and would just end up dying again, temporarily losing a lot of his Celestial energy.

"I still not sure about the Celestials' strength in general. From the sound of it, Athos was quite a strong one according to Sil, but even he hasn't had much experience."

"Okay, everyone!" Wince said, clapping her hands.

"In about half a day's time, we should be approaching my home planet. Before that though, I think it would be best if we all discuss how we are going to approach this."

Nog walked over to stand close to where Wince and Ceril were standing, but as for the others they looked partly disinterested in the whole thing.

"Come on!" Ceril said. "Can you guys take this seriously? Don't you already remember what happened at the cruise?"

"Do you think that was the full force of their attack? The Mermerial Race that Yanny is in charge of is strong. We can't just go there, defeat them and save the day."

"We can't?" Sil replied, which sounded a bit sarcastic but he was actually somewhat serious. They had done that with the towers owned by Athos' before. The only reason; they didn't do that with Athos was because they didn't even know where he was located, but this was a different story as they had their own personal tour guide. Why not just storm the place and get this over and done with?

"The danger is real." Wince explained.

"Yanny is in charge of a group known as the predator fish. In the past, they had ruled all of the Mermerial race planets. They were naturally stronger than the other types and did well to defend us from attacks and more."

"However, as time went on more peaceful times were ahead of us. The predator bloodline was mixed with several other fishes creating mixed bloods, but Yanny, and his group of people had always remained pure."

"Many people support them thinking that strength is the answer, rather than talking, communication and technologies."

"Either way it's true, the predator type are the strongest by far, and they have only gotten stronger."

"He was what he calls his ten generals. Those that have been by his side for a long time and who receive a strange power."

Hearing this, Quinn was a little interested now.

"The strange power, is it the same as the commander that attacked us before? And is he a general?"

If he was a general, then Quinn knew that the whole thing would be a walk in the park.

"Yes, it's the same power, but no the commander from before was relatively new, he was not a general and they are more powerful."

"Before, they were reluctant to use the new technology that our side had created but now they are openly accepting it, which has just made them even more fearful."

It was true, Quinn was surprised by the power that was outputted by their weapons. It was more powerful than anything earth had come up with, new or old. Quinn wouldn't tell Logan that, but once again, he had been introduced to a race that would have easily been a threat to earth, even with all their abilities.

"This is why I suggest we first go to the Royal Vault." Wince suggested.

"There will be items that will help us win. Items that my father kept in there for use at times like this."

"In fact I have a feeling that the legendary beast, the trident, might have been sealed in there before my father disappeared."

"He was good at predicting things and how the other side would move. He might have even predicted his own disappearance."

Sil was sweating once again, and started to avoid eye contact.

"I'm sorry, but the beast, and the trident you are talking about isn't in there, it would be useless to go in there!" Sil thought, but was wondering how to word it so they didn't have any false hope.

"I doubt it will be easy." Sil finally spoke up.

"I mean if they know there are powerful items inside, then they will definitely be protecting it, right? Maybe we should just use our own powers to defeat him."

"Are you an idiot?" Ceril asked.

"If we are strong enough to defeat Yanny and his generals, then we are strong enough to beat the guards or whoever is guarding the royal vault. Getting what is inside will make us stronger and give us more chances of winning this battle!"

"If the spear is in there, it will be able to transform it into the legendary Hydra, and the weapon itself is even more powerful when used in the right hands." Wince explained.

"I know it's unlikely to be in the vault, as my dad took it with him many times, and I have a feeling that... the others have already dealt with him, but we have to try, and with that weapon, I feel like we have more chance of victory."

Sil looked at Quinn, asking, almost begging for his help in some way to stop these girls from entering the vault, because every word felt like he was being stabbed in the heart, as if the world wanted him to tell them the truth.

"We won't be going to the vault." Quinn said.

"This vault is our reward, it was your words, not mine, and I don't want to waste my time going to one place when we can fix the problem faster by going to another place."

The girls stayed quiet after Quinn spoke. They respected him, and were thankful that he had even come on the trip. After hearing Quinn speak multiple times, they knew that he was serious about getting this done as soon as possible, and they would rather do it his way, than without him.

"This Yanny." Quinn questioned. "Is he the one that is giving powers to the others, the generals you are worried about?"

"Yanny is the leader of the Predators. However, he is not the one supplying them with power. There is another that Yanny is able to summon."

"I have only seen him once, when going up against my father, but it is possible that if we can take the item off him that he won't be able to summon him."

For Quinn, though, he was pretty sure this was the Celestial, and he wanted him to be summoned. Worst case, he would take the item himself so he could summon the god.

After some time of discussion, they could see the ship approaching one of the planets. There were several large ships orbiting it, with fleets of smaller ships, the same type that had attacked the cruise.

"It looks like this isn't ogling to be as easy as just getting on the planet and getting rid of Yanny." Nog stated.

Rather than the large ship and the fleet of smaller ships, Quinn was more concerned with another problem.

"Hey, this planet we're going to, I don't see much land on it, or anything that looks like a big city." Quinn asked, his voice a little shaky.

"Of course, that's because we mainly live in the water." Wince replied.

The others looked at each other, because it was a bit of a problem for them all, since none of them could breathe underwater.

"We aren't going to be able to fight at our best." The Dalki stated.

"At all, for some of us!" Nog added.

The two sisters looked at each other and their eyes widened. The thought had never crossed the mind, that the others might not even be able to reach the city in question.

As for another thing, seeing the sea and the idea of getting into it was causing Quinn's body to shiver, as he had a deep fear of the sea.

***

# Chapter 1826: Owner of Marpo.

"WHAT!" Ceril screamed so loud that nearly the other ships through space could hear her.

"I don't understand. Didn't you say you were some god of blood or something, and you're afraid of the sea? I mean, isn't like water and blood are quite similar?"

"Look." Quinn said, giving out a deep breath.

"I just feel more comfortable being on land. What is wrong with that? In the water, I can't move well, I can't see well, all my senses are dulled, and there is no telling what is in there. It's like the dark but ten times worse. I see no reason why everyone shouldn't be afraid of the sea, other than you guys."

Although the others weren't scared of the Sea like Quinn was, they all thought he had brought up a good point. Even the Dalki would struggle to fight in the water, so it looked like the group needed a plan after all. Especially if they couldn't dive down.

For now, the ship was staying a little way from the planet, as they also needed to figure out how to get past the fleet of ships without attracting attention.

"I know!" Wince said with a smile on her face. "There is a special item in the Roval vault, just for situations like these. Pieces of beast-tier equipment that will allow you to breathe underwater. I can get those..." Her voice soon started to trail off as she realised what the problem was.

"And how do you want to get those without us if the place is guarded?" Nog asked.

It was time for them to put their thinking caps back on again, but that's when a solution arrived.

"Well, I can travel in the water somewhat." Doguth said. "I'm not as strong as I am on land, but we can hold our breath for around six hours."

"I never knew the Dalki were Whales," Sil commented.

"Anyway, it won't be so much a problem for me either. I have an ability that will allow me to breathe underwater. It is just the restricted movement that will be the problem for me."

It looked like in the end that the Dalki and Sil were the only ones that could go with the girls, so the plan would have to be just that. The girls, along with the two, would try to get to the vault.

"Then what about us?" Nog asked.

"There is an island," Ceril said. "One of the cities is located on an island. We can stop there for you guys. You stay put while we dive down to the city centre and come back."

It sounded like a good plan, and Quinn was somewhat relieved that he wouldn't have to go into the water and would actually be able to stay on land. Surely there would be some way to convince this Yanny character to meet them.

Steal something precious of his and rise up, who knew? Either way, knowing that Sil was going gave Quinn confidence, and it might also be something that he could complete on his own.

Surprisingly, there was another solution put forth by Sil about avoiding the space fleets and that was another ability Sil had. In his large book of abilities, he had many that would have seemed useless in a battle, but they are proving useful here.

For one, he was able to turn any object he touched invisible as long as he was holding it. At the same time, everything inside of the object he would touch, as long as they were touching the object as well, would turn invisible. So that's what the group had currently decided to do.

The ship was now travelling in stealth mode while being invisible, so the engines were dead silent, but it also meant that it would take a bit longer for them to reach the planet. It was a shame that Sil didn't have the power to just teleport them all. But then again, although the distance looked small from the ship, it certainly was vast.

Since there was some more time before they would leave the ship, Quinn had decided to approach a particular person that was on board.

"I know the two of us haven't spoken a lot," Quinn said.

"I'm sorry if I seem a bit nervous when talking to you. I'm sure you know the situation between our two races?"

The Dalki nodded but also looked Quinn up and down.

"From what I know, our two races have a different problem, though?" Doguth replied. "Aren't you a vampire, not a human?"

From the sound of it, the Dalki knew a lot more than Quinn originally thought, which was perfect for what he wanted.

"Oh right, and our relationship is even more complicated. I'm quite interested in you."

"I have a lot of questions, how are you even alive and more, but I know from Sil that you won't answer that, so I thought I could ask you more about the Marpo-Cruise, when it all started, and when did you become captain?" Quinn asked.

In a roundabout way, Quinn was trying to find out if was related to the Dalki that he knew. Something didn't seem right. If the Dalki were still alive, there were only a few people that Quinn imagined could keep them that way, and they were meant to be dead, both of them.

"The Marpo-Cruise. I have been there since the beginning, I guess. Originally there was just one, but soon the company grew..." Doguth stopped there. It was as if he was about to say something.

"I know why you are talking to me. You wish to get home, but as I said to your friend. I have never been to Earth and have no idea about it, but there is one person who will know."

"The owner of the Marpo-Cruise line, he is a Human himself. Everything I know about Earth, myself and the Dalki past is thanks to him." Doguth explained.

Hearing this, Quinn stopped there, thinking who on Earth could it be that was still alive or had information about back then. Was it Jim Eno? Was he somehow still alive but the fact was that the Dalki had specifically said human instead of a vampire?

It was then that Quinn's eyes started to glow red, and he looked toward the Dalki.

"And the human, the owner of the Marpo-Cruise, what is his name?"

Using the influence skill, Quinn was hoping to get a truthful answer, His heart was thumping louder. Something was going on in the universe. Something that he wasn't able to see, there was a deep dark feeling that he had, but he wasn't quite so sure what it was.

That was when the Dalki didn't answer and tapped his nose.

"Your name is Quinn, right? I will pass on that you wish to meet him, and let's see what he says."

"The influence skill didn't work... he is a five spike, so that would make some sense, and it never worked against beasts well. Still, I thought it had a chance."

"Alright, everyone, we were nearly there in the city. Everyone remembers the plan and don't cause too much attention." Wince ordered.

Walking over, Quinn headed back to Sil's side and looked over at the Dalki. He then folded his arms and whispered.

"Keep an eye on the Dalki. See if you can get any information out of him. Don't harm him...he seems like a nice one, but if he's in trouble, don't help him out so much. Let's see how strong these guys are."

There was a strange feeling and thought going through Quinn's mind, and it was a dreaded thought. The threat of the Dalki was meant to be over. It was in the past, and a thousand years had passed without that said threat coming back.

Learning of what was happening, a thought crossed Quinn's mind, what if he wasn't the only one, and what if he wasn't the only special one that could hold an ability? Before anything like the thoughts that were going through Quinn's mind would come true, he needed to meet this human.

***

# Chapter 1827: Hydro Station.

Sil's ship was heading to what looked like a relatively small island. The landmasses on this planet were mostly of island sizes, but this was one of the few with a city built on it.

The city was quite normal and similar to those on earth. It was filled with large skyscrapers, towers, streets and more. Only the architecture and colours differed from the cities on Earth. Most buildings seemed to be made of a light blue material, almost jade-looking while they would also have hints of green and yellow.

Several round giant pearls were also used on certain parts of the building to join them together, or on the outside for decoration. It was hard to get used to, but it always was when they travelled to a new planet.

The most luxurious things were the long large white sandy beaches. There were several fishmen.on them, enjoying food, drinks, and more. There were huts for people to live in with large legs for bases that stood in the sea and a giant oval floating object in the water.

"What's that?" Nog asked.

"It's a hydro station." Wince replied. "They have giant tubes that send people through the water to travel between the different cities, including the capital centre."

"So there are two options for us. We can either try and sneak in and take the Hydro station, although I believe we would most likely get caught. Or we can choose to just swim through the sea."

Even though Quinn was no longer travelling with the others through the sea, he shuddered at the thought of having to do something like that. "The sea?!" Ceril looked panicked. "You can't go through the sea. You might not survive. Just take the Hydro station. I'm sure we can figure out a way."

"What's so bad about the sea?" Sil had to ask since it looked like the better option in his head. At least for a task like this one.

The sea is dangerous, even for us. Wince explained. "Because there are dangerous Sea beasts that travel in the water."

"They don't attack the cities or the groups of Mermerials because they know that they can get hurt if they do so, but a small group like ours, we would be sitting ducks."

There was another reason Sil wanted to enter the water. He wanted to know how effective his powers would be, flames, lighting, wind, etc. Perhaps the only ability and the best ability to use in the water would be water, but how effective that would be against the fishmen was unknown. However, there was still one trump card that would definitely work well underwater.

"I can't use that. If I use that, it will cause all sorts of problems." Sil scrapped the idea instantly.

The ship soon landed on the part of the beach that looked to be the least crowded. There were plenty of trees near the beaches, so there were enough spots for them to hide the ship. The only problem was they couldn't avoid making noise if the ship bashed and landed through the trees.

Even though it wouldn't be a loud one, anyone nearby could notice such a thing, so they decided to land it at the top of the trees, allowing it to hold the ship up.

"The ship has a camouflage option, but it will no longer be invisible."

"It can fool some people, but if someone looks at it from above, it might only be a matter of time until they find this, so we need to move fast."

All of them jumped down from the ship and stepped on the ground. It was time for the group to head separate ways.

"There's no need for you two to wear disguises when you enter the city. We have plenty of ones that look similar to you." Wince explained. "Just don't catch the attention of the others, not until we have the equipment we need."

Nodding, Quinn and Nog headed towards the city while the others ran towards the Hydro station.

Walking through the jungle, Ceril and Wince picked up a few colourful fruits, squeezed them, extracted some juice, and then rubbed the strange juice all over their face as if they were painting on it.

"Is that your disguise?" Sil asked. He could still separate them apart, not to mention the lines on their faces weren't really helping them in this disguise.

"Not many know the face of the Princess and her sister." Wince replie.

"Our father was the leader who was killed before we even got any chance of limelight or to be revealed to the world. These disguises are good enough."

"They won't recognize us at a glance here or there, and besides, the Hydro station is automatic. The only problem will be getting a ticket, but the rest is done by itself."

Walking on the beach, they noticed that quite a lot of people seemed to be leaving the city and heading towards the station for some reason. A large wooden walkway that reached the station was crowded, and others who looked in a rush decided to travel by water.

What was fascinating was that as soon as the human-like figures touched the water, their bodies transformed into different types of fish, allowing them to swim quickly toward the station.

"I wonder what these two girls would transform into when they touch the water?" Sil thought, but they would see that soon.

The large crowd and the busy station were to their advantage. The guards stood still and seemed to allow everyone to walk in. The group of four kept their heads down as they walked through, and finally, they were inside the station.

It was far more spectacular than Sil had imagined. Right now, they were walking through a large glass that allowed them to see the sea. Numerous fish were swimming around in the water, and it all looked beautiful.

Until, for a brief second, Sil saw a large tentacle snatch one of the bigger fish and pull it into the deeper and darker water. Whoever that tentacle belonged to, one could not see its dark body.

"I think Quinn was right about the sea." Sil gulped.

Trying to ignore what he had just seen, he looked at the large plastic-like tubes travelling in the sea. In front of them, there were about ten of these pods that the people would step into.

Then, a sound would go off, shooting through the pod. Finally, the passenger would be sent through the plastic tubes deep into the water to the location stated.

"You guys wait here," Ceril said. "I'll go get us all tickets."

Wince's face looked like she was ready to stop her, but Ceril shook her head.

"If they catch you, it's all over. Remember, you're the princess, not me. I won't be recognized, and once t get the tickets, we can all queue up and head to city."

Ceril had already run off before Wince could respond. So they waited for a while, but Wince was nervous as she bit her fingernail and walked around in circles.

"Yes... make us look even more suspicious," Doguth commented.

After a few minutes, Ceril returned, and she had a smile on her face.

"Come on, let's get moving quickly!" She said as she handed each person their ticket. They then all picked a line and lined up.

The queue was moving quite quickly, and Sil could see what one needed to do. First, scan the ticket before entering the tube, and the door would open, then stand inside to be blasted off. It was simple.

Sil and the Dalki, at times, would move back a little to adjust their position, allowing the Fishman behind them to go before them because they wanted to go in at the same time as the girls.

If they went in before them and there could be a problem they would need to deal with it. In the end, after exchanging places with others a few times, all four reached their respective tubes simultaneously. They scanned the tickets and stepped inside.

There was a bit of excitement in Sil, and he felt as if he was going to be going on a theme park ride. The next second and the arm buzzer sound went off. It blasted all four of them down the tube and into the sea.

They were travelling at the same speed, and when they looked to their right and left, they could see each other. Now, Sil was where he had seen the fish from earlier. As they got deeper into the sea, Sil noticed several different creatures.

It was amazing, as there were several light sources that floated about in the sea, allowing them to see.

Then Sil noticed that up ahead, the tubes breached off into several directions, and this was because they could travel to several other cities and directions from one Hydro station. This made sense until Sil and Doguth were sent down another tube and taken to the right. Then, the two girls pods deviated and sent them to the left.

"Wait, this doesn't look right! We're going to completely different places!" Sil was alarmed.

They turned towards Wince and saw her scream a few words towards them, and her face showed similar shock and panic. But they could not hear her and, within a few seconds, the two pairs were separated and heading into two different directions.

***

# Chapter 1828: A place to die.

As they went through the tube, the two sisters felt tremendous g force on their bodies. It was hard for them to move, if not at all. They thought of trying to break out of the tube to get to the other two, but Wince instantly scrapped the idea after thinking for a while.

Breaking the tube wasn't an option. Even if they somehow managed to destroy the building, they would have brought a lot of unnecessary attention to themselves for destroying the Hydro System, not to mention they would be in the middle of the deep ocean alone. All in all, destroying the tubes wasn't worth the risk.

"I'm sorry, guys... you came here to help me, and now I don't know what is going to happen." Wince clenched her fist, and finally, the siblings were chucked out of their tubes into the deep ocean.

Instantly, they felt something strange ensue as soon as their body crashed into the water. Their legs started to merge and grow as they stuck together, then their scales on their body grew and covered their whole face, and at last, a fish tail protruded from where their feet were.

For Ceril, the scales on the bottom half of her body were a glittering blue, while her sister Wince's scales were shining in bright pink. The two of them had transformed into what most people on Earth called the mystical creature, a mermaid.

In front of them, there was a large city of some sort, and its familiarity confirmed that they had reached the right destination. This city was called Mercil, the capital of the Meremerial race. Just like the city from earlier, there were several skyscrapers here as well. Only these were more like a palace, with giant swirls all around them, making them appear grand and added a majestic aura to them.

There was also an elegant shine to the whole city, and at the end was the royal palace, which even in the deep sea, shone with bright glittering colour all around and illuminated everything. The two can see everything clearly even though they were still far from the place as they were chucked into the deep ocean by the Hydro Tube.

This was the same for the others that had come out from the tube, only they were already swimming towards the Hydro station, which was at the city's base and was around five times bigger than the one they had departed from.

At the same time, they also noticed several tubes, like the one they had used, coming from different directions, and more people were being shot out of them and just like the others, they swam towards the station.

"What is with all of these people? Something is definitely going on." Wince wondered, and this thought made her feel even more anxious than before. Although the city was a popular destination, this was completely different. Everyone was running to it as if their life depended on it.

Doing a quick turn in the water, Wince looked towards her sister, who was clenching her hands in nervousness.

"What happened, Ceril? Where are the other two now? Why aren't they with us?! Did you not know the tubes would send them in a different direction?" Wince asked.

"I didn't know, I didn't know!" Ceril replied.

"When I bought the tickets at the counter, they didn't ask any questions or anything. So it looked like no one noticed anything, and I bought the same tickets for all of us. I'm sorry."

Ceril burst into tears, thinking it was her fault, and her sister seeing this, couldn't shout or blame her anymore. Swimming through the water, she went to her sister's side and pulled her into a hug to calm her down.

"It's okay, Ceril. These are tough times, we have a lot on our minds, and in the first place, this is something the two of us need to do."

"Maybe they've been watching us from the beginning and wanted us on our own? We need to be careful from now on," Wince said.

"But we can't distract ourselves. We need to continue on our task. We have to enter the city and somehow get to the Royal Vault."

"It's up to us now, and we must do our part so the others can help us." Wince started to swim off, and Ceril was not too far away.

Quinn and Nog walked through the dense jungle and now had entered the city. There were large open, wide streets that allowed them to explore the city easily. The only thing was, the two of them noticed something very strange.

"Hey, don't you think this place is a bit empty?" Nog asked.

"Compared to the beach and everything, it looks like everyone was heading to the station. Are they running away or hiding?"

Hearing this, Quinn nodded. He had noticed this as well. It was more like the place was deserted than anything. In the end, Quinn spotted an old man in a shopping stall. The latter had barbecued small fish and shrimp.

"Does this count as cannibalism? I guess even fish eat fish on Earth, so it would make sense." Quinn said.

The old man had a large fin on his back, webbed hands, and wrinkles all over.

"Why is the city so empty?" Quinn asked.

"Empty? Are there no people here?" The old man replied as he turned his head left and right.

"You're right. No one is here. Hmm... I do remember some customers talking about a royal ceremony. Was that today? I can't remember. Would you like some fish?"

The old man was jumping from subject to subject. but Quinn had gotten enough information he needed from the man.

"A Royal ceremony? Is that why everyone is in such a rush? Is everyone going to the Capital City?"

"Maybe it's to crown this Yanny guy? Anyway, we shouldn't worry about them so much, right? Your captain is a strong guy?"

"Yeah," Nog replied. "As long as your friend is as strong as you say he is, the two should be okay against any trouble they come across."

Although Quinn agreed, he started to look around the place. Maybe there was something that the two of them might need to do to perhaps attract some attention, so the others had an easier time.

"Well, I don't want to get in the water, but maybe there is another way, another large force that would be sure to get their attention." Saying these words, Quinn looked into the distant sky, where the large ships and fleet of ships could be seen. It was a backup plan, but the question was now, how long would Quinn wait until he decided he would need to act himself?

—— —— ——

At this moment, a human and a Dalki were moving through the tubes at a fast rate. It had been a while since their tubes got separated from the two girls.

Unlike the girls though, both the Dalki and Sil were confident that they could break out of the tube. The only thing was if they did, where would they end up? And where would they have to go?

They had no clue where and how long to swim in the vast ocean to find the city. In the end, it was better to at least let the tube take them to some place, wherever it was, and plan from there. There should be another Hydro station they could access from that location.

Out for the bottom end of the tube, the two of them crashed into the water. There was no change in their bodies, but Sil immediately started using the Water ability around him to ease his movements and breathe underwater.

"Hey, I can move easier than I thought. Controlling the water in the sea makes my movements slower than on land, but it's not too bad. Maybe as I get used to the speed, it will be alright." Sil thought.

He turned around to look at how Doguth was doing, and the latter looked fine as well. Using his large tail, the Dalki swam through the water relatively easily. Now that they had regained their composure, the question was, just where were they?

They stared at the front, and the sight was not like they had expected. There was no city, or at least not one they were expecting. Instead, there were underwater ruins of what once was a city, and it was now covered with strange green moss all over the place and more.

And, there wasn't a single structure in sight that looked to be well, someone or something had destroyed everything, and the ruins looked to stretch to miles.

"What is this place? Why would they even have something like this?" Sil said.

Just then, shutting out from one of the tubes behind them, a fish person had turned into what looked like a sick turtle. Slowly he started to float his way towards them and into the ruins.

"Hey!" Sil called out. "Sorry to bother you, but what is this place? Is there a Hydro station nearby so we can leave this place?"

The turtle man slowly turned his head. His eyes looked dead as he stared at the two.

"What is this place...you came here, and you don't even know? This is the place where people who no longer wish to live... come to die." The turtle expressed as he continued to drift towards the ruins.

# Chapter 1829: Sea beasts. (Part 1)

Both Sil and Doguth looked at each other. They both were waiting for the other one to take charge as to what to do next. After all, from the brief look around it looked like there weren't any other hydro stations in the area.

According to what they had heard from Wince, every city would have several hydro stations to allow them to quickly travel to other places. So where were they now?

"There is no use in us doing nothing. Why don't we follow the person from before and ask him some more questions about this place." Doguth looked around, but it really didn't seem to be a single person alive, but maybe searching through the ruins they would find something.

There had to be a reason why a hydro station even went to such a place, in the first place.

"Why don't we just wait here? Don't you think that would be the better option?" Sil asked. "I mean, eventually someone else will come out of the tubes after us right?"

While the two were talking, Dogthus was noticed that the fishmen that looked somewhat like a crossbreed between a human and a turtle was still floating deeper and further away into the ruins.

If they decided to stay now, and no one else came, then they might never get thier chance. Using his large tail and kicking his legs without saying anything else to Sil, he went off into the deep sea ruins.

"Shouldn't we stay? And isn't there some way we can go back in the tube and reverse it?"

"Maybe we could just follow the hydro tube back to the start, that would take us to the original station, wouldn't it?" Sil thought, using one of his abilities that drastically improved his eyesight as if it was a camera on several times zoom, Sil followed the tubes with his eyes, and he soon could see gigantic large creatures.

Swimming in the large deep sea, they had multiple large eyes, strange spikes sticking from them, and teeth among other things. These deadly sea creatures were the size of mountains moving underneath the water.

"All of them look to be the same size at that Hydra I faced. What is with this place? Is it just full of demon-tier beasts or something?" Sil thought.

"How have this Mermerial race managed to survive on these planets for so long with these things in the water. Either way, Quinn did say I should keep an eye on the Dalki."

Spinning the water in the palm of his hands, Sil was able to move quite quickly. It worked like a propeller. It was still relatively hard for him to move from side to side and other parts of his body.

"There they are!" Sil spotted Doguth and the turtle. He started to head towards the two.

"What did you mean when you said people go here to die?" Doguth asked blocking his way. The turtle moved towards him crashing into his chest.

"Would you please move... please? You should understand. After all, you are in the same place as me." The turtle replted.

"Well, we are here by accident, so please talk to us, otherwise I'm afraid I would have to stop being nice." Doguth stated, raising his hand and making a fist, trying to somewhat threaten the fishman.

The turtle started to laugh.

"Please, if you could end my life then that would make me happy, and I am very sorry to hear about your circumstances. If you are here by accident, then your fate is sealed like all of us."

"My family are gone, I no longer have friends, and my wife has left me. I am afraid I no longer wish to be here."

The next second, the turtle was dragged suddenly through the water. The Dalki attempted to reach out and grab him but was too slow, and all he could see was something had wrapped around the turtle's waist and pulled him into the deep dark sea.

In the ruins, there were several items that would create a light source for them to sea. Making everything a slightly blue hue, but beyond the ruins, there was just the darkness of the sea.

"What happened?" Sil asked, having just arrived. "It looked like something pulled him... it reminds me of what I saw before, in the hydro station."

Sil gulped, and he didn't even want to use his ability to see what was off in the distance.

"Did you find out anything from that guy? How to get out of this place? Anything?" Sil asked.

"I think so," Doguth replied. "But nothing that's going to help us out of our situation. This is a place where people go to die."

"When people no longer have the will to live, they come here. And I'm guessing that creature that just grabbed him must be the reason."

"You're saying that they come here to just die and get eaten by a giant fish," Sil said.

"How could the Mermerial have a place like this? It's almost encouraging people to give up. There has to be some reason for them doing this."

Rather than think about the situation or answer Sil's questions, once again Doguth was on the move. He swam right to where the strange turtle had been taken.

"This Dalki, is he not scared? And I don't understand what he's doing." Sil thought.

"Even if we find what killed the turtle, how is that going to help us get out of this place? Killing the beast will do nothing."

The two continued to swim through the ruins, looking at all of the destroyed buildings. They were relatively close to the sea floor, as they could see several items buried in the sand, including treasure and pearls.

It was hard for them to know how long everything had been down here for and they had yet to find anything. Finally, the Dalki decided to tread on his feet, on the surface of the floor.

"What's wrong, isn't swimming faster than walking?" Sil asked.

"Yes... but I fight better this way," Doguth replied.

At that moment, out from the sand, two large tentacles dark grey in colour rose up crashing through the ruins. It had easily destroyed them not slowing down. It was clear that it was the same type of tentacles that had grabbed the turtle from before.

Both of them at the same time came whipping down towards the Dalki. Sil could see this and had his hand ready to throw out an attack.

"Wait, let's see how he deals with this." Sil thought.

Raising both hands, the Dalki took the tentacle hits head-on and bent his knees, Sand from the ground floor was kicked up everywhere, but the Dalki still had a firm grip on either end.

Grabbing hard, his fingers dug into the end of the tentacles and blood was dripping out from them. Still, the tentacles had some level of strength to them. Even the Dalki with his great power looked to be somewhat struggling until he turned his head towards them and his eyes started to glow up.

A red lazer came out from them, hitting part of the tentacle, slicing it right off. He turn his head, the lazer from the eyes hit the other tentacle and the same thing happened again causing the other tentacle to fall.

"These guys were hard to deal with before they had abilities. Maybe Lazer Eyes isn't so much of a problem, but imagining a Dalki with the same powers as someone like Owen."

"I understand now why Quinn wants to keep an eye on them."

"It looks like you vanquished the great beast, so let's get out of here," Sil said standing by his side. "Let's spend our time trying to figure out how to get back."

"Can't you smell it?" the Dalki replted. "The smell of blood is coming from over there."

Staring in the direction of where the Dalki was looking at, in the distance, past the end of the ruins, there was a large dark outline that was part of the sea. It looked like a mountain in the water.

Soon though, rumbling from all of the ruins was felt. The entire ground was shaking and what was left of the buildings was starting to fall one after another.

"An underwater earthquake?" Sil wondered.

It was then, that the giant dark figure that could be seen in the sea, suddenly had two red glowing dots, and hundreds of large snake-like shadows could be seen.
