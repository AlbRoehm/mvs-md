# Chapter 1460 - An Old Enemy
The lab on the main Dalki spaceship that they called home had been a lot busier ever since they had obtained the Dragon from Blade Island. The Jim clones, along with other Dalki, had been working on a number of different things.

After obtaining the Demon tier beast, they had focused on creating a number of new Dalki. They had an idea of the process from Jim's research, and there were also the clones that had his brain and memories from a certain point and time.

Rather than just creating any type of Dalki, they had been creating the new era of Dalki as Graham had called them. These were Dalki that were based on certain individuals from the humans that they had fought.

Using their DNA as a base structure, they were able to create more unique and stronger Dalki. As for all of those that would be considered a type of failure, they were sent to Graham and others for some training, though none of those Dalki ever came back.

Still, it was because of this that the lab had expanded, growing twice its size as it had taken on more projects. Some Dalki had even been created for the sole purpose of helping out with experiments and other tasks.

In one part of the lab, there was a place that had seemingly been forgotten because of the new advancements that the Dalki were focusing on. There also was another reason for its abandonment… It used to be Jim's private lab. Everything that was needed from it had already been taken out and distributed to the other areas.

In the back of the lab, through a heavy locked door, there were a few cells. Dangerous beasts, Dalki although very rarely unless used as an experiment, but also prisoners would be placed behind a large solid glass wall. Apart from two of them, all other cells were now empty.

In one of them, a figure started to bang on the glass a couple of times. He was trying to grab the attention of two individuals that were free on the outside, who were acting as guards. One of these was a clone of Jim, whereas the other was a three spiked Dalki.

In a way, they were also keeping an eye on each other.

"Hey, what the hell is happening outside? We haven't had an update on anything. Come on, with my talents, I'm just wasting away in this cell! Go call the real Jim and tell him that Truedream wants to speak with him!" The person who was in the cell was Jack Truedream, former member of the Big Four.

There was no way to tell how much time had passed in that prison cell, but he knew that it had never been this long since the real Jim had passed by to ask them to do something for them.

Seeing that there was no reaction, Truedream just let out a big sigh.

"He's dead, isn't he?" Truedream asked. "Well, it looks like even you can get startled. Well now I don't know who is winning this war whether it's the Dalki or the Humans, what do you think my friend?"

"I'm not your friend." The other man replied instantly. He had crouched down, rocking back and forth. He had heavy bags under his eyes, and he had quite long scruffy black hair that stuck out everywhere. "You can't say that Jim is dead until we see that he's dead."

"Crazy as always." Truedream mumbled from the confinements of his cell. "Then why do you think he hasn't come to see us? It's not like the Dalki have any reason to tell us if he died or not. Heck, I bet that crazy Graham has done him in, just because Jim gave him a Hawaiian shirt or something."

There was still no answer from any of the other three, and it seemed it would be that way for a long time. In the end, Truedream decided to go back to his bed and lie down as well.

"I was just wondering why the hell are you so loyal to that guy, anyway?" Truedream asked. "We have nothing better to do in here, so we might as well talk, right? In here, we're nothing more than lab rats, but you were with him before I even met him… and even after all this time you seem to still care for him.

"Come on, with the way you hung around him, one could have mistaken you for a girl who was having a real crush on her best friend. However, it seemed to be very one-sided. Given your ability, couldn't you have changed that, making it so that he would have followed you?

"Admit it, it must have at least crossed your mind, once or twice. Then again, knowing that guy, he must have had a precaution to that. Was that it? Did you try and fail, and then it hit you instead?"

Usually Truedream wasn't this talkative, but he had started going a little mad not being able to talk to anyone, so now that he had a 'neighbour' it was one potential buddy. He wasn't expecting an answer either, which was why he continued to ramble and goading him in.

"He saved me." The man eventually answered. "I was just another starving kid, out on the street, and he fed me. For me, that was enough of a reason to repay him with the rest of my life and do whatever he wishes.

"My parents either didn't care about me enough, or they couldn't support us, so one day they just left me out on the streets. The other homeless were happy to beat me just because I was weaker than them, and took what little food I managed to scavenge. Everyone else just turned a blind eye, walking past me like I didn't even exist. The only person who didn't was him.

"You know, I've heard people often claim if they were in a similar situation to what I was in they would rather die. Each day was painful, be it from hunger and/or the beatings of others, but for me… well dying always seemed like a very scary thing. I could never think about dying, and all I wanted to do was live.

"Why wasn't I allowed to live? Just because I had no money… because I was a child… because people didn't care about me… Well, he changed that, he allowed me to live, so I decided to help him however he wishes."

There was a silence before Truedream answered. His cellmate's story wasn't exactly a special one. Jack knew some people from his own family had lived like that. During the war, there were plenty that had been abandoned and couldn't be taken in.

Especially if they had no use, or power for abilities.

"Sounds a bit fishy if you ask me." Truedream commented after lifting his body from his lying position. "Do you think he might have picked you just because he knew what power you had? At least to me, it seems like he just used you, so you could help him deal with all of those vampires? I mean, he doesn't have any other humans by his side other than the two of us.

"Hey, why don't you tell him the truth?" Truedream addressed the Jim clone, who would have for sure known the answer, Truedream thought.

"Even if that was the case, does it matter?" The man questioned Truedream, for the first time looking up at him. "In the end, he was the one who got me out of that hell, whether it was because he wanted to help me or for ulterior motives, I don't care."

Once again, after that conversation there was silence between the two of them, and Truedream was trying to think…if Jim was really dead, then they needed to get out of here.

"What about you?" The man eventually asked back. It was the first time since the two of them had been together that the other man had asked Truedream a question of his own.

"You turned up one day by his side, so what's your story?"

Thinking back to what happened that day, Truedream couldn't help but laugh.

"Hahaha, well for me, I did something incredibly stupid. You probably don't know them, but I decided to go up against a group of people called the Blade family… after that… I guess you could say Jim saved me as well.

"Come to think of it, how did you know?" Truedream asked, looking at the Jim clone. "How did you know the Blade family was going to come after me that day?"

Looking to his left, Jim stared at the Dalki, before walking forward and eventually went up the glass standing on the other side looking in.

# Chapter 1461 - A Strange Day
Today felt like it was a strange day. Usually, no matter how much he complained or talked, no one would react to anything he said, but today of all days two people choose to react differently.

'Maybe today is the day… I feel a change coming.' Truedream thought as he quickly licked his dry lips with his tongue. The Jim clone just looked at him without saying anything, which was infuriating Jack even more, until he eventually exploded.

"Are you going to answer me, or did you just come here to stare at my face all day?!" Truedream shouted in frustration.

"He doesn't seem to know." His cellmate explained. It's most likely that he doesn't know about what you are asking him. When I was with Graham and Jim, they made me change the memories of his clones in the facility as some type of safety measure.

"As I understand, it was a way for them to still listen to Graham even though they were clones." After these words had been spoken, the clone turned its head towards the other cell.

"Are you saying that my current memories are not mine? Is this to do with the ability he spoke off? I always thought things… felt a bit off."

Turning around, the clone went back to his position standing next to the Dalki guard, who gave him a brief stare. It was clear he wasn't pleased with the words that were spoken earlier.

Once again, some time had passed and nothing was said by anyone in their room. Everyone was minding their own business as they had been doing, but Truedream had been busy scheming a plan that might see him escape.

"All clones should have memories from the original up to the point in time they were created, right? In that case, he should have known the answer to my question before you meddled with his memories, correct?" Truedream asked. "By the way, you never told me your name."

"Malik." The man in the other cell replied. "And yes, you're correct, but there's no way for us to know when these clones were created. Some could have been created even today."

"Assuming he's still alive, Malik." Truedream pointed out. "You know, there's someone in this room that probably knows the answer to that question. Isn't that right, big guy?"

'Today was a strange day', this thought kept repeating in Truedream's head, and so far two people were acting weirdly in the room, so perhaps he could get one more person to act out and complete this strange day.

"Why don't you tell us the truth?" Turedream asked. "I mean, what harm does letting us know do? Are you scared of Graham? I thought Dalki weren't meant to have fear, always striving to the top, trying to become the strongest of their kind.

"Yet what you're doing here seems to be the opposite of that. Be honest, did you piss Graham or someone else off to have been assigned guard duty? Neither one of us has any ability that would allow us to escape this confinement, and that Jim clone should be more than enough to check up on us.

"At the same time, you have every right to be afraid of Graham. He probably sees your lives as expandable fools at best. He always talks about how he is doing everything for the continuation of the Dalki race, or to become a 'complete race', but is that really his goal?

"Someone who eats other Dalki to get stronger? In the first place, isn't he completely different from the rest of you guys? And I'm not just talking about his weird clothing fetish, but maybe he actually just wants to create a load like him?

"Have you ever thought about his actions? He never tries to fix a current Dalki, instead he is always trying to create a complete one. So what happens once he creates a complete one? Is he going to 'cure' the rest of you… or will he simply let you die off and have the new generation take over?"

Truedream had stopped speaking there, carefully observing the Dalki the entire time to watch out for some type of reaction. Alas, there was none, at least not one that he could notice.

'Perhaps he just has an excellent poker face, but this Dalki seems to be even calmer than the rest.'

A knock was heard on the outside door, and when it was opened, food was handed over to the Jim clone. It was drink and food to keep their two prisoners alive. Nothing too fancy, basic gruel to eat and normal water to drink. There was a small slot in the glass that could be opened from the captors side. The food would be placed there, on a type of tray, and then pushed forward.

First, the one to be served was Malik, but the clone's actions were also strange. When opening the gap, instead of pushing the tray through as he would usually do, the clone pushed its hands through as well. His body was positioned in a way to cover the view from the Dalki, and 'Jim' didn't say anything, just looked at Malik as he silently mouthed the words.

'I want to know the truth. Let's find out if Jim is really still alive.'

Making out what the other had said, Malik touched the clone's hands quickly and activated his power.

'I'll remove all the memories that I have altered.' Malik thought.

The interaction only took about a second and after that the tray was passed and the clone went on to the next container, as he went to pass food onto Truedream as well.

"You wanted to know how I knew about you?" Jim asked. "Your family has been monitored by the vampires for a long time, Jack Truedream."

Suddenly, Truedream's attention was caught. Today really was a strange day… but it might also become a very wonderful one.

"Yours is a power that is able to cross boundaries, more boundaries than you might imagine, and a long time ago we used one of your ancestors to transfer a certain power. They considered that power to be too dangerous, hence they had decided to get rid of your family line.

"Don't feel bad for them, though, your family was scum and always were scum. Which was why they had overlooked a certain matter. You see your ancestor had raped quite a few women during his time and before his death he had gotten one of them pregnant.

"This person hadn't told anyone about the child, which was why they had overlooked this fact, but I was interested in your power. Did you know that abilities find a way to appear in those most suited for them? Even if Truedream back then hadn't taught anyone his ability, it would go to those most suited. Yet, the Truedream ability was nowhere to be found. Maybe that was because the most suited family line was still around. It was a guess but as a vampire I had a lot of time.

"That led me to my search. A stroke of luck, you might call it, but I decided to look into that man's past and searched for the women he had… 'mistreated'. That's what led me to eventually find one of your forefathers. I told them about their dead father, and they decided to take the name once again. It was only a matter of time, of generations, until the ability would fall into that bloodline again.

"I didn't have a use for your power so much back then, but thought that maybe one day I would, and that's why I kept my eye on you."

For the first time since speaking, the three spiked Dalki moved forward.

"How do you know all of that? Answer me now!"

Truedream didn't feel disheartened to find out about his family's past. For one, that had nothing to do with him. Those crimes had been committed centuries before his own birth, so why should he care what another person did, merely because he shared a blood relation to them?

Nevertheless, Truedream saw a light in this situation. With everyone in the room, perhaps they could change the situation.

"It looks like you remember everything." Truedream smiled. "And you, what are you going to do, go running to Graham? Will that help you in any way? Instead, how about we make a deal. You heard what he said, didn't you? I have a special power, a power that can even cross boundaries, and let's say we decided to keep something secret even from Graham.

"I can give you power, my big friend. Power that would allow you to even topple Graham. Would you like to carry on living with an uncertain future… or would you prefer to create your own?" Truedream asked with an evil smirk.

*****

# Chapter 1462 - A New Era
Honestly, Truedream wasn't so sure if the Dalki would accept his offer. If it had shown some type of reaction to his early comments it would have been more convincing, but since there was nothing to go on he was starting to get a bit worried.

Somehow, Truedream's words had managed to convince everyone else in the room, and Malik had managed to do his part. However, if the Dalki proved to be loyal to Graham, then it would mean Truedream would have to pray that the clone of Jim was strong enough to beat the three spiked Dalki.

'A three spikes is tough, especially without any beast gear. Maybe Malik could do something if he managed to touch him before being splattered, but I doubt the clone alone would be enough.' Truedream thought.

The good news was that Dalki hadn't outright refused, he was taking his time, considering the deal that had been put in front of him. The Dalki stood in front of the glass while Jim had moved to the side away, creeping over to where Malik was. It seemed like the clone was frightened.

'Good luck with me putting hope into that guy.' Truedream thought.

The next second, the Dalki started to chuckle.

"What you say does interest me. All of our race wish to grow and get stronger, but there is one universal thing that each of us instinctively knows. It is impossible for a lower spike to beat one higher one in a one on one fight.

"Are you aware that our leader has recently evolved into a six spike? So, tell me, human, how exactly do you plan to help me become stronger than Graham?" The Dalki asked.

The biggest grin appeared on Truedream's face, because with this answer he knew that he had got the Dalki right where he wanted him.

"I am an honest person." Truedream replied. "Based on what you said, you would never fight against a four spike, correct? Perhaps I might be unable to give you power that can beat Graham just yet, but I can definitely give you power that allows you to beat those above you. Grow, evolve and trust that I can allow you to catch up!

"You know about the powers that the vampires and humans hold? The things we refer to as abilities? Well, you see, that vampire over there captured me to make use of my power, which allows me to steal the abilities of others and transfer them over.

"However, there is something that Graham doesn't know yet. Your leader believes that I'm unable to move these powers to the Dalki or the vampires. I'm willing to give you an ability that will make you stronger, and I always save the best abilities."

The truth was, Truedream was spouting a pile of bullsh*t. Jim had never asked him to move any ability to a vampire, much less a Dalki. As such, he had no idea if there would be such a restriction, but based on the story he was told moments ago, he was gambling that it might not be the case.

If the Dalki could gain abilities, they would evolve a step further.

"I like the sound of that." The Dalki guard agreed, just in time to hear a door opening from behind. Since they had won his trust, the Jim clone had audibly let out Malik from his glass cell.

"So it looks like you are joining this strange team of weirdos then." 'Jim' commented, smiling nervously. A group consisting of a Dalki guard, two humans and a vampire clone. Seeing how Truedream was looking at him, Jim felt like he had to say something else.

"You always need a back-up plan, if the Dalki hadn't agreed then, we would have had to have used a little friend here." Jim said, slapping Malik on the back.

"To get out of this place, in case we are found out, I will have to give you one of these powers, and I'm sure that you wouldn't let me leave until I have you one. The only problem is the method of transfer is a little complicated…but just so you know, I'm not trying anything." Truedream warned, turning his head away as he looked at the Dalki's face.

"Anything for strength." The creature replied.

Truedream nodded towards Jim, and unsure if it was coincidence or not, at that moment, Malik touched the back of the Dalki. Memories were starting to flood his head. At the same time, Truedream held on to the Dalki head using its thigh to kick himself up and pressed his lips on the other. It was the condition that he needed to pass his power to the other.

Once it was complete,Truedream wiped his lips.

"Are you done?"

"Yes." Malik said. "We didn't know if he would betray us after getting the power, so I have given him a backstory that will make sure that he will stay loyal to us forever. If not, at least the power will remain in his mind."

The Dalki came out of it, and looked at all of those in the room.

"Thank you for saving me, and for giving me this power."

Truedream wondered what memories Malik had exactly put in his mind to make the Dalki think that they had 'saved' him. His ability was perhaps one of the most frightening Truedream had ever come across, and if he could avoid it, he would never allow Malik to touch him.

"Well, do you know the best way to get out of here?" Truedream asked.

"I do, there are plenty of ships at the docks that are connected to the lab. The others use them all the time to transfer things between the areas. However, they know that I'm supposed to be your guard, so we will have to sneak our way round.

"Perhaps I could convince a few of them and there will be many that don't care what I'm doing due to how busy it is… but if they see the two of you." The Dalki stopped there, because the others understood what would happen if the two of them were to be spotted.

"No!" Malik refused. "We need to go and get the original Jim! If you can't agree to this, then I won't come with you. I won't alert the guards, but I won't leave this place without him either!"

*****

# Chapter 1463 - The Cause Returns
This was a problem, from the few conversations Truedream had with Malik so far, he could tell that his mind was somewhat child-like. If not that, he was heavily dependent on Jim for everything. More on the borderline of obsessed with him.

'Man, I'm jealous to have someone this obsessed with you. I wonder how he did it?' Truedream thought. 'I was hoping the clone would be enough, but I guess not. His power is also too strong to utilise. If we run into just a single Dalki as well, he could change their memory to help us. Our chance of escape relies on him. I'm useless without other people, but that's why I'm the best at gathering people around me.'

"I actually agree with him." The clone surprisingly added. "I was created a long time ago, when the lab first started. My knowledge of everything Jim has done, and the knowledge of what is going on out there, is limited."

"There is a problem with that." Dalki said. "Jim is dead. I don't know the full details of what happened since I wasn't taken along for that task, but apparently those who went to retrieve the Dragon, brought back his deceased body."

That answer seemed to somewhat shock Malik. He started to rub his hands through his hair, while stretching his skin back. It looked like he might create a fire with how fast he was going.

"Just his body?" The clone asked. "Then we can still do something. If the original body is there, it means that Graham was keeping him for some reason. Perhaps his brain is still intact. If that's the case we can create a new clone. It will have all the knowledge and memories of Jim before he died."

The clone then turned towards Malik and placed both his hands on his shoulder, lifting his head up, so he could see him in the eye.

"Look at me. All of us are clones, we are no less than Jim. We have the same mind as him, the same thoughts, we just haven't lived the same life as him. If we create a new clone from his dead body, his mind will live on. The mind of the 'complete' Jim. We have to save him right now.

"And before you say anything Trudream, yes he is needed. We have to start thinking about what we are going to do once we leave this place."

Hearing the words seemed to give Malik some type of hope, his eyes looked less lost, and once again it looked like Jim, even if it was a clone, knew just the right words to say for him to cling onto.

The group decided to leave, and when they exited from the room, they could see that Jim's lab had been abandoned. There were literally wires hanging from above, and it just added to the brutal reality that the real Jim was gone.

The one who they were following was the three spiked Dalki, who they had decided to call Pine. This was because of a set of small scales on the top of his head that stuck out, making him resemble a pineapple.

When opening the door outside the lab, it led to several large hallways which looked mostly empty. Apart from a few Dalki and clones that would run past once in a while delivering something to the other areas.

"Why are they so busy?" Truedream asked.

"It's Graham. After obtaining the Demon tier beast, he's ramped up production on everything. Anyway, the good news is, the most dangerous person, Graham himself, isn't here." Pine answered.

The clone and Pine were able to walk side by side. This was because there were plenty of clones in the area anyway, and like pine thought, everyone was too busy focusing on their own task to care what others were doing.

Between the two of them, they were able to tell if the area was clear and tell when the other two were able to move. While looking in the lab, Truedream also noticed that there were no cameras.

'I guess there is no need. All the Dalki work together, and it's not like there's an enemy faction or intruders to worry about. I bet they never thought a Dalki would turn on them quite like this.' Truedream smiled at his 'achievement'.

Eventually, the group reached the lab, but the next part would be the most difficult one. There were people inside the lab at all times. Fortunately, Jim's body wasn't kept in Graham's private room or anything, but it was nevertheless heavily guarded… at least on the outside. Two three spiked Dalki could be seen standing in front of the door.

The group was only a turn away from reaching the entrance.

"What do we do?" Treudream whispered.

"I have a plan." Malik suggested.

——

Walking through the hallway was Pine and the clone, and when they reached the door, they quickly turned to the two guards.

"What are you doing, keep moving!" The Dalki instructed, almost immediately attacking, but in that instant, Pine grabbed both of their arms acting first, then from his back, Malik jumped over the two Dalki and touched both of them.

Seconds later, and both of the Dalki bowed down.

"Graham, you have returned, and it's nice to see you as well, Jim." One of the guards addressed them.

Watching it all, only strengthened Truedream's fear of Malik's frightening ability. Eventually, Pine had told the two guards to leave, and head somewhere else for the time being, allowing the two human to enter the lab as well.

Here they could see the countless glass containers, and floating on one side, was Jim's body. They all knew straight away, looking at the body that Jim really had died.

"I wonder what happened while we were trapped in that place. I also wonder how the world would react regarding our return." Truedream said.

Next, Jim went up to the machine, and it was time to start the cloning process and create a new clone of Jim Eno.

*****

# Chapter 1464 - A Ragtag Group
Since Jim was one of the ones that had taught Graham everything he knew, and a lot of the technology was based on what he had introduced to them. Jim was able to recreate a new clone from what was left, reactively easy.

'How many experiments have they run? One of the nest crystals… its energy has nearly completely faded. I never even knew a nest crystal could run out of energy.' The clone thought.

On a closer look at the body, he noticed that actually, one of the nest crystals had been removed from the real Jim's body, while the other was left in his hand. Still, it was enough energy to create another.

A blob started to form, which soon formed into the grown man known as Jim Eno, the claw machine moved and eventually pulled the new clone out from the glass container and dropped a naked Jim onto the floor.

"Damn it! That brat killed me, he killed me!" Jim started to scream, hitting the floor. He soon got up and could see the others, and the outcome certainly was a little strange. He was expecting to meet with Graham.

After updating them on the situation, Jim had learnt that there had been a gap between his death, and him being created into a new clone. Because for the Clone, his last memories were of what had happened on Blade island.

"I see, now that my real body is dead, Graham doesn't have any use for me since I no longer have my ability, but he kept me and my brain intact, so he could still ask me questions whenever he would need me." Jim said in disgust.

After hearing what was said from Jim though, Turedream had equally disgusting feelings. He had learned that Quinn, the boy with the Shadow ability, had gotten so far in his life. Yet here, his life had completely changed after meeting him.

'It was because of that Shadow ability that he made me go after the Blades! What is all of this crap? That damned kid better be alive, so I can kill him myself.' Truedream thought. The good news was there looked to be another one that equally wanted to kill the boy known as Quinn as well.

'After that, it will be the Blade family, and that damned, military that ruined me.'

While the others were thinking and planning what to do next, Jim went to the console and the clone was taking a look at what he was doing, but since they were both the same person they understood, until Malik had asked.

"What are you doing?" Malik asked.

"What do you think? Graham kept me alive just to use me. I don't like that, not at all. I'm tired of being used by people. The Jim up there is dead, and the only use it will be now is to Graham. Every time another clone gets created, it will be from when I died on Blade Island.

"Graham could pretend to be on my side, get the information he wants and then kill that, and the next clone would be none the wiser about what happened. Who knows how often he has done that already? If we leave him up there, Graham will just be able to do this again and again, killing me over and over."

"But then, you won't be able to clone yourself if one of you dies in the future." Truedream mentioned.

"It's okay, I will use the remaining nest crystal from the original body on myself. I won't die, but you're right I won't be able to clone myself either, but it's what needs to be done."

Malik wanted to stop him, but he didn't because he knew that no matter what, since it was Jim's mind that was making the decision, that all the Jim's would think the same way. This is what the real Jim would have done, and he had to trust Jim's mind.

Bringing out Eno's real body was easy. Using the crane they dropped his body onto the floor as well. Eno took the clothes that were on him, which were a bit torn and ragged, but it was better than running around the place naked.

After that, he took the Nest crystal and placed it in his chest pocket for now. He would have to figure out how to use it properly some other time, then finally he looked at his head and hovered his foot slightly above it.

"Goodbye, myself." Jim said, stomping hard on the ground and crushing his head and brain.

After that, it was time for the group to leave, but now there was one more person with them. In order to avoid confusion when calling the two names, for now they resulted in calling the old clone CJ, for clone Jim. Even though the new clone was Jim as well, it seemed like Jim didn't like that fact and told them it was easier if they just forgot that he was a clone.

Sneaking out of the lab though was far easier than they thought, and once again, Pine was filling in Jim on the advancement the Dalki had made.

"It's good to know that all my hard work wasn't completely in vain, at least they managed to capture the Dragon… still… I'm a bit surprised why they stopped. According to my original plan, after capturing the one on Blade Island they should have caught the second shortly after… does that mean something went wrong? Did Arthur fail… or did he turn sides again?"

The idea of Arthur failing seemed somewhat impossible to him, but he would just have to find out more as time went on.

Eventually, they had exited out of the lab, with little difficulty, and after heading through the terrain and around the building they had reached the docking bay of ships. Here, ships were constantly flying out and coming into the lab.

After watching them for a while, what they noticed was the movement of dead Dalki bodies, being shipped backwards and forwards.

"Here's where it gets hard." Pine said. "We can't sneak any more, we have no choice but to steal one of those things."

"Or we can try to use my ability to get people to help us." Malik argued.

The problem was the large field that was in between where they were and the closest medium size ship, they had no choice. The only thing they could do was walk, and pretend like they were naturally meant to be there.

They hid Truedream, and Malik towards the centre, and if people did see them, they treated them like prisoners, at least they could tell the others that Graham was the one that ordered them. They could see a ship in sight, they were about 20 metres from making it until…

"Hey, what are you guys doing here on the field? Who are those!" A Dalki yelled.

They debated just running to the ship, but with a Dakli's strength it would be easy for them to just jump and take down the ship. Turning around, they all hoped they would deal with the Dalki easily. When they did, they could see a Dalki with four spikes on its back.

"What is this? Those are the two humans that are meant to be in the lab, what are you doing here!" The Dalki shouted. "I'm going to have to call this one in!"

Before he could, though, Pine dashed forward and grabbed the Dalki by the arm.

"Damn it, let's get out of here!" Jim shouted. "The three spike is done for."

"No." Truedream said. "He's not, that three spike is a little different."

The next few moments came and went like a blur, because with ease, the three spike was able to beat and kill the four spike. It was the first time something like that had ever happened in the Dalki's history.

After getting rid of the troublesome one, the rest of them got on board the ship, and started heading off. As they were leaving there were several that seemed to have spotted them, but since they hadn't prepared for anything like this happening, their reaction was too slow, allowing the ragtag group to escape.

While in the ship, after realising they were safely away, they all looked at each other for a moment, and Jim started to laugh.

"Haha, so what do we do now? The vampires won't accept us, since I'm their enemy. We all have a grudge against humans. The Dalki will be searching for us, and we can no longer go back there, it seems like there's nobody who will accept any of us." Jim pointed out. The words sounded sad, but saying the words he was smiling.

"I guess, we just have to make our own place that will accept us." Truedream replied. "We will come back when we are ready. Let's just let the Dalki and the rest of this play out."

# Chapter 1465 - Gather Them All
Everyone had remained at the stadium for a while. There wasn't any trouble happening on their respective planets, so they thought it was safe to stay there for the time being. Everyone also had this underlying feeling that when they went back, perhaps it would be difficult for all the leaders to meet up again once the war started again, not that they still weren't in a war.

On top of that, little bits still needed to be figured out by everyone before they moved out. After what they had learnt about Pure's coordinated attack, Earth wasn't a safe place for them any more, and they could practically trust no one. As if vampire agents working for the Dalki hadn't been enough, now they had to watch out for humans as well, all while fighting in a war.

While Sam was discussing things with the others, Sera and Quinn had taken a walk around the large stadium, taking a slow stroll through the entire thing would take around two hours. It was that big. Alas, it was no longer possible to make the entire tour, since a big chunk of it had been destroyed.

On their walk, Sera had asked Quinn a number of questions. To start off with, he had wanted to know how Quinn knew about Bliss and Ray. The Cursed faction leader didn't hide any of the facts, telling him how the former had come to meet him after his adventure on Blade Island, and how he was related to the latter.

In order for Sera to feel more safe around Quinn, he also informed the others that he knew exactly what he was… a 'God'. When calling him one, the other reacted in an unexpected way… Sera had started to laugh.

"A God, huh? Some of those people really are up their own arse." Sera said. "A word created by humans for those that they worship. I don't like using that word to describe myself, but if it makes it easier for you, then sure, go ahead."

With that out of the way, Quinn proceeded to ask Sera about his past, about his relation with Ray and what he knew about the Talent family. Sera wasn't shy about this, and after Quinn had revealed to be Ray's descendant, Sera went on to explain what he knew of the other's ancestors, how in the past Ray had gone through so many journeys and had so many enemies, quite like what they had today. (Author's Note: If you would like to learn more about Ray, please read My Dragon System, it's completed with 500+ chapters.)

Quinn was truly lost for words after hearing everything Ray had accomplished, and it sounded as if his 'exaggerations' might have really been on the mark. There were some things Sera didn't seem to know, but based on what Quinn had heard Ray say, he could fill the gaps.

Still, even after finding out everything, the Quest to learn more about the Talen family had not changed in any way.

'I guess in the end, I really am going to have to talk to Bliss. If Ray was really a Dragon and not a human… maybe Bliss will know more about the actual Talen family.' Quinn thought.

"I would like to ask a favour from you." Sera requested, after all the talking they had done. "I want the two of us to have a fight after all of this is over. You see, in the past, Ray and I didn't really have the chance to finish our matches and… I'm afraid we won't ever get to.

"Unlike us, he isn't a 'God', as you so call it. He won't be coming back, not unless Bliss has done anything to make it so. Either way, you have part of his bloodline in you, and I can tell you're one scary person. So my request is, get stronger, reach your peak and then look for me, so we can have a match."

Hearing this, Quinn thought Sera wasn't a bad person after all. Perhaps, unlike another person, Sera had just chosen not to get as involved with the humans' problems as the others. To meddle less, unless he felt like he really needed to.

"You don't think I could beat you, right now?" Quinn joked back, but he was also quite serious. He hadn't seen Sera fight, so he had no idea of his real strength and whether someone at his level could beat him. At the same time, Quinn found it hard to imagine there would be many who could beat him.

Sera gave him a little tap, and hit him slowly on the chest, allowing the vampire to feel the difference.

"Not yet. Ray might have had the power to fight the Gods, yet you're not there yet. Perhaps if you were to take on that form from before, but I doubt you need to tell me that it was just borrowed power. Become something as powerful as that from yourself, go beyond what you are right now. In the meantime, you can trust me to take care of Pure."

The words spoken by Sera reminded Quinn of another Quest that had been assigned, which was to become something beyond a Vampire Lord. Perhaps he was right. In Quinn's mind, the enemy had always been the Dalki, so would he need strength beyond his current realm to deal with beings like Sera in the future… or were the Dalki themselves also becoming a race that the Gods would have to be wary about?

"Sure, you have a deal." Quinn smiled, shaking his hand. "I think Leo and the rest will be in good hands."

After their conversation, he went back to Sam for an update on things. The vampire soldiers being led by Ashley were on their way. Once they arrived, they would be briefed on what they were to do and head off with Leo and Sera.

Then, with their worry of Pure in the back of their minds, Sach, Owen and the Cursed faction would head back. At the same time, a decision had been made, that the vampires would be supporting the two groups in the war.

Before that, Quinn was to head back to the vampire settlement to check on what crystals they had. At the same time, armour and beast gear would be made for each of the vampire leaders, then the leaders would be split up. Their families were to support either the Earthborn group or the Graylash group.

All of this shouldn't take more than a couple of weeks at most. Not only was Alex working on this, but so were all the other forgers as well. Everyone had agreed to come together after this event, because the decision had been made.

No longer would they be waiting, with the vampires' help on their side, it was time for them to stop being on the defensive. They were going to take the war to the Dalki. If the Dalki weren't attacking them, it meant they were preparing something.

If Quinn and the rest could finish their preparations first, then they would equally attack first and get the jump on them.

'Helen, I promise I'll avenge you.'

After Quinn had informed all the leaders of what was going on, Quinn allowed the leaders to decide who they thought they would be best suited to help. The Graylash or the Earthborn group based on what they had seen so far.

After the meeting was done, and they were informed of what was to happen, there was one leader that had stayed behind wanting to speak to Quinn. Surprisingly, it was the fifth leader, Sunny Kent. Quinn was a little worried when she asked this, but out of all the leaders, she seemed to give off the most calming aura and seemed to be the least threatening out of them all.

"Your Majesty." Sunny addressed him in a soft voice, sitting down in the canteen. The whole area was empty, with just the two of them alone. She had her hands placed in front of her, with her fingers crossed, sitting upright in the perfect position. Her hairstyle was neat and kept behind her, which reminded Quinn of a motherly figure.

"Yes, Sunny." Quinn replied. "I think your plan is well, and while they are unsure of our power it is a good chance to fight back, but I wanted to talk to you about something. You see, I have been doing research into the familiars that us vampires use, and I think if we were to utilise the vampire subclasses and the familiars, we could increase our chances even further in this war."

This naturally caught Quinn's attention. He knew the strength of familiars, but it seemed like many vampires didn't have, or at least didn't utilise them much in a fight. He always wondered if it had to do with their pride, if they regarded them as a distraction, or if it had other reasons.

From what he had learned, it was a little difficult to control familiars, which was why sometimes vampires opted to not use them even in a fight. The fifth family were better at this because they could communicate with them, and ones like Quinn's familiar were different because they were able to act on their own.

Still, if there was maybe a way for the vampires to utilise them more, or they got rid of their traditions to allow all of them to have familiars, it might give them a big boost to their strength.

"Have you heard of the Four Kings?" Sunny asked. "On the field I saw two of them appear, and I know you have one with you as well, but if we can get the fourth all together, get them to work together, then it could increase our force drastically."

*****

# Chapter 1466 - Unite Them All
The four kings it was a term that Quinn had learnt not too long ago and had heard about it recently as it had popped up again. Still, he didn't know too much about it or about them. When first obtaining his own familiar the Boneclaw, he had heard it be called the Undead king from the others.

Some thought it was just a title due to its appearance and great strength as a familiar. According to Leo, who had travelled to the familiar world with the others, it wasn't just a title. It was a name that had been given to it in the familiar world. Something that the other familiars also knew him as.

A large world with familiars all around that lived off a certain type of energy. Here there were four rulers.

"The Bone Claw, Leo's Cat and Oscar's Horse," Quinn mumbled as he went through them all.

"Exactly." Sunny smiled, doing a small little clap as if she was pleased that he already knew some details. "Honestly, I was surprised to see them all. I didn't even know your vampire knight had one. As you know, our family is able to communicate with familiars, which is why I was able to get information of my own about this world and come to know a little about the four kings. For me, the familiars have always been a great interest of mine.

"They command over territories in their world that stretch quite far and wide. Many vampires don't know this, but at times, when one person has summoned a familiar, another will refuse to come out. This is because these two familiars are from different territories. It seems like they don't get along, but their relationship appears to be more complicated than that. You could think of these familiars as if they were from different kingdoms.

"My familiar nor the ones I have talked to know much about why these territories are in place or why they were divided like so. Either that or they feel like they cannot speak about it. It seems, though, the system they had was set up even before their time, but something that hasn't happened before that has now.

"Three of these kings have made contracts with the outside. Perhaps if we could gather all four of them, we could call for help from their world. We just need to find the fourth king! Which is why I wanted to talk to you. Perhaps your Boneclaw, another king, would know the answer? How to contact them."

Thinking about Sunny's suggestion, it was worth a shot, but there was a problem. Quinn and the Boneclaw hardly talked. It seemed like Bones only came out when it felt like it, usually either when Quinn was desperately in trouble or when Quinn had a strong desire for something.

"I can try, but even when I have communicated with my familiar in the past… It's been tough to communicate with him. He speaks with few words." Quinn replied.

"What if you summoned him?" Sunny asked. "I could talk to him instead. There aren't many familiars that can speak our language, so that would make sense."

Nodding, Quinn agreed to the request. He closed his eyes and tried summoning him. He focused at first on his anger and tried to see if the Boneclaw would come out that way, but there was nothing.

Then, there was only one other thing Quinn could do, and that was to head inside his mind and try to connect with it. Eventually, Quinn had gone into a deep concentration and had entered a black room.

'I never thought about it before, but this reminds me of the shadow space as well.' Quinn thought.

Looking in front of him, he saw no one, until eventually, the mist started to appear, and the large Boneclaw's body was formed. It stared down at Quinn. After having countless battles and seeing countless things, the large figure still looked horrifying compared to everything else that he had seen.

"Long ago, I beat you in that battle when you challenged me. I thought you would help me after that. So why won't you let me summon you out of my own free will?" Quinn asked.

The Boneclaw lifted its long dangly finger and pointed towards Quinn's chest.

"You…two sides." The Boneclaw said and then imitated his chest breaking in half.

It was safe to say Quinn didn't understand what he was saying, but if he was to understand the gist of it. The problem was to do with himself. Forgetting about this for now, he decided to stick to the task.

"Do you mind going out now? We want to talk to you. It's about your world and the four kings?" Quinn asked.

Quinn didn't know if what he had said had upset his familiar, but before he knew it, he had turned into mist once again and disappeared.

'Yep, definitely not the talkative type.'

Opening his eyes, he could see Sunny with a big smile on her face like she was expecting something. Which just made it harder to tell her, and for some reason, Quinn felt a bit embarrassed that he had failed.

"It's okay, don't worry about it. A lot of the direct descendants have trouble summoning their familiars as well." Sunny said, trying to comfort him, but it didn't make Quinn feel any better. She was talking about direct descendants. Did that mean that none of the others had this problem?

"I just thought of something," Quinn said as he raised his head. "There is one who is a little talkative compared to the others. We could always ask him?"

Sunny tilted her head because she wasn't sure what she meant by that. Still, Quinn knew there was one familiar that could speak just fine, as an individual often complained about him.

A short while later, returning to the Canteen, was Leo, but he wasn't alone as they decided to bring Oscar as well, along with him was Mona. She actually didn't want to come along but insisted that he was attached to her by the hip for some reason.

Even Mona didn't quite know why, and often Oscar would give signals asking her to check up on Samantha. It was also because of this reason that Mona would be staying with the Earth group for the time being, rather than going with Quinn or the Greylash Group.

As for the reason why they were all invited, it was to find out answers. Quinn had come up with a backup plan. For one, he thought Sunny would be able to communicate with the horse if need be, but honestly, he didn't think that would have to be the case.

Soon, a little black cat appeared on the table, and it was none other than the familiar known as Ovinnik, or Ovin for short.

"What do you think you guys are doing!'" The cat shouted as it licked its paw. It was hard to tell if he was concerned or not. The sound of his voice showed urgency while his actions, such as licking his fat paw, appeared as if he wasn't worried at all.

"Why would you bring three of the kings in this area? You want to cause a fight?" Ovin said. "You're lucky that I promote peace more than anything." After saying these words, the black cat laid on its back and just started to roll side to side, once again diminishing the urgency of his message.

"Actually, the reason why we called you was so we could find the fourth king." Sunny smiled. "We were hoping that we could ask for help from the familiars during this war."

After hearing these words, Ovin stopped rolling and got up, and then there was a smile on his face.

"You want the four familiar kings to help you?" Ovin said. "I'm wondering, woman, did you know that there is a war going on in the familiar world as well? Or perhaps that's why you are making this suggestion right now."

*****

# Chapter 1467 - The Fourth King
Ovin's words didn't seem to surprise Sunny, but with the small interaction Quinn had with her, he was wondering if this leader ever could get surprised by anything. Thinking about it, he just never saw her startled.

'I wonder what her face was like when she saw Laxmus?' The strange thought had entered Quinn's mind.

Regardless, it was hard to tell if she really did know what was going on in the familiar world or not. Judging by the fact she could talk to them, Quinn was inclined to agree with Ovin's thinking.

"Explain if you can, please," Quinn asked since it didn't look like Sunny was going to say anything. "Also, if there is any way we can get the king on our side, it would be a great help. So far, all of the kings have shown their great strength, and I'm sure this one will be the same. Even if they are only half as strong as you."

The usual smirk appeared on Ovin's face upon hearing this.

"If you really want to cuddle up to me so much, then you should come over here and rub my belly," Ovin said, tapping it a few times. A small empty sound was heard as his big belly shook for a fraction of a second when it was hit. "But seriously, you all know nothing of the familiar world, do you?"

After letting out a big sigh, Ovin strolled across the table and then laid down in front of Leo. He touched him a couple of times with his paw until Leo eventually started to scratch his belly. He seemed to be enjoying himself, and Quinn wondered if the former really would tell them the story while…like that.

"First, let me tell you the familiar world is huge, and new familiars enter our world daily, but frankly, we don't have as many familiars as the humans. However, it's not because we don't want more, there is a simple reason for that.

"There is a lack of energy. Our world produces the energy we feed on, but it's weak. At the same time, that energy we feed on is also what makes up our world itself. And that's why we are attracted to other worlds and make contracts with others so we can take this energy from our hosts. At the same time, these links with you guys allow us to pour more energy into our world.

"In a way, those that are creating contracts with the vampires are doing a service to the world. Like me." The Cat smugly pointed at itself still on its back. "Still, even with all of this help and extra energy, it's not enough compared to the number of familiars coming to our world.

"Which is why there is a need to cull our own kind. The energy itself is what creates our world and allows us to live. If the energy disappears, our whole world will be destroyed, and no one will survive.

"Some older familiars are willing to go on their own, leaving the world and no longer existing. Those who have contracted before and had their desires filled have more chance of accepting this, while others put up a bit of a fight. This is where the duty of the four kings comes into the picture. We, familiars, are far stronger than the others, and we are forced to get rid of those who do not wish to go.

"It was our natural selection. It started when we were elected by the others in our areas, worshipped by the other familiars, because their lives were suddenly in our hands."

Quinn felt strange hearing the story. For some reason, he felt a little sorry for these kings. He couldn't imagine the need to kill his own just for a feeble amount of resources. Sure the other familiars looked up to the Kings, but it wasn't because of respect; instead, it was fear. It reminded him a little of his own situation.

At the same time, if they had chosen to do nothing, if these great powers had chosen just to let the familiars roam free, consuming the energy, then it would mean the whole world would no longer exist, and none of them would survive. Their job was a necessary one.

He wasn't sure if familiars had the same feelings and emotions as humans, but if Ovin was anything to go by, some of them were just as emotional as humans.

If a similar situation had happened on earth, Quinn honestly wondered what would happen. Perhaps with the way humans were, there would have been a war no matter what.

"And what about the war then? Why are familiars fighting over each other if things have always been okay? It seems sudden." Sunny asked.

It looked like Ovin was enjoying his scratches a little too much as he didn't reply straight away and continued to roll around. Which eventually caused Leo to stop. When he did, Ovin knocked on Leo's hand a few times.

"Answer her," Leo asked.

Rolling, Ovin sat up once again.

"It's actually because of everyone in this room," Ovin answered. "The familiar kings are picky, but it's because we search for those that will help fill our desire and also supply us with a large amount of energy.

"The contract with the kings has allowed an increased rate of energy to transfer to our world but only to our territories. In other words, more familiars are permitted to enter our world. This sounds like a good thing, and you would be right, but it made others jealous.

"For instance, the undead king was absent for a long time, but his land had obtained benefits due to his contract. The other three, including me, decided to ignore this. However, the Horse disappeared, and his land was supplied with energy, leaving only two, including me.

"At the time, there was still a general balance because of two kings. They were next to two lands that were thriving with energy, but then I had decided to leave as well—supplying my territory with extra energy. This had left the remaining king and the other familiars in those territories… quite jealous.

"Our lands were thriving with energy, so we could have more familiars and less needed to be killed, but the same can't be said for their territory."

"So, you're saying this is your fault?" Sunny said immediately with the usual smile on her face.

For the first time, it looked like Ovin was displeased.

"My fault? Did you not hear the Boneclaw was the first one, and then the Horse disappeared? Was I supposed just to stay put? The two of them are equally at fault; also, the remaining one stayed back to start a war."

"Isn't there a simple solution to the problem then?" Quinn asked. "Why don't they just make a contract with one of the vampires or something else? Wouldn't that mean his territory receives energy as well?"

The others agreed on the point that Quinn had made. They thought that the solution was so easy they were looking forward to having the four kings on their side.

"Yes, I agree that would be the easiest solution, but remember what I said about the four kings being stubborn? That king is the most stubborn of them all.

"The energy that is given to our territory is more of a bonus. More so than that, we don't just feed on energy but what we as individual familiars feed on is your desire. Each one of us, when making a contract with you, was attracted to a certain part of you, a certain emotion.

"And unfortunately, that one has never made a contract with another one before. So I would say you have a few options. Find someone who can match his desire, which I think is highly unlikely; no one likes that fat guy anyway.

"Or…you will have to find some way to force him, but be warned, he's strong. Whoever ends up contracting with him has to be sure they can beat him; otherwise, they might end up losing their life." Ovin warned.

*****

# Chapter 1468 - Travel To A Different World
At the moment, Quinn was waiting for three things before continuing further with what he wanted to do. One of these was for the vampire soldiers to arrive. He wanted to speak to Ashely on a few things and clearly state what they needed to do. With Paul no longer being with them, Quinn couldn't help but be a little worried. After promising them that they would see thier families again, he was giving them an incredibly dangerous mission, and he didn't like that.

When they did arrive, Leo would be leaving with Sera to handle the matters on earth.

This was one reason why Quinn thought they needed to do it now if they wanted to sort out this familiar matter. Because Ovin seemed like he would be a lot of help.

Looking at the fat black cat again, Quinn wasn't too sure he agreed with his own thought on this.

Another thing he was waiting for was Beast Gear for all the vampire leaders and the special crystals to be utilised, and lastly, for a nest crystal to be discovered by the fourth family.

The Nest crystal would upgrade his system, and he would be able to attack the Dalki at full strength. Although the Nest crystal was at the bottom of his list because he didn't know how effective it would be or how long it would take.

It was because of these things that he needed to wait, and he even thought sending someone to try and get the fourth king on their side wasn't too bad, as long as it didn't take up too much time, of course. Still, how they would solve this issue was something Quinn was seriously stumped on at the moment, and the others could see that.

"I have a small suggestion," Leo commented. "When visiting the familiar world, I found that the energy that is released from our bodies, and the energy that you guys speak of is similar to our Qi, and it is our life energy.

"However, what I never understood and still fail to understand till this day is, why do you make contracts with Vampires rather than humans who are low on Qi? I and Quinn are an exception to this rule, but the others aren't. Perhaps if you were to use a human who was high in Qi instead, the fourth king might be interested?"

Ovin sighed again as if he was expecting this question to pop up.

"For this one, there are a couple of answers. First, the energy passed on through us isn't energy borrowed from you directly. Why do you think your Qi doesn't decrease even though we are with you? We are simply using you to absorb the Qi around and pass it on to our world. Although what you say is correct as well. The more Qi you can control in your body, the more we can pass.

"Only in certain situations would we need to get Qi directly from you. The second is about the link that is established. The link and those connected to our world have always been vampires. Whether that's because your ritual only works with vampires, or if our two species are related somehow, who knows? But not once in our history has anyone contracted with a human." Ovin explained.

"That's because it doesn't work." Sunny spoke straight away. "Our historical records show that a ritual used to summon a familiar with a human doesn't work. Like the familiar said, maybe it's because our ways or the magic circles that we have passed on for generations are set to not work with humans, but those circles in the first place were made by one of the originals."

Magic, a word Quinn had heard a few times from his ancestor. According to Logan, magic existed in the world at one point in history but has been long forgotten. So it was unlikely anyone knew how to create a ritual so a human could connect to the familiar world.

Maybe there was one person, but he was suspected dead, and if Logan didn't have the knowledge, it meant it was something that Richard didn't wish to pass on.

"Wait!" Quinn said, thinking about this. "How did you connect to the world last time? I mean, isn't there a physical difference between going to the familiar world and trying to connect to it?"

"You're correct," Ovin replied. "Maybe if you actually went to the familiar world, that can happen, as to how to get there, the answer is actually with you."

Ovin pointed his paw towards Quinn's chest. The latter looked down and wondered what he meant but then remembered the story that Leo had narrated; The Boneclaw was the one that had created a portal for the others to escape. Could he create a portal for them and a human to go there and meet the fourth king?

"Well, it's decided then. I'm sure you can at least get your familiar to do this, right?" Sunny said, already standing up and oddly looking at Quinn. At the same time, he wondered how she knew what Ovin meant.

"I mean sure…maybe." Quinn was losing confidence by the second, but he should be able to convince the Boneclaw somehow. "Though we still have a problem then. We need to find someone; one, they need to be a human, two, they want to contract with a familiar and is willing to go with us, and last but not least, they need to be strong enough to handle the familiar. Those conditions are nearly…impossible to fulfil."

When thinking about who to select, he realised that if they wanted more chances of a contract, it would have to be one with strong Qi and match the desire of the fourth king. There weren't many strong humans still left in the Cursed faction.

"I can help search those with strong Qi," Leo claimed. "I think if we journey together with the other kings, they can guide us quicker so it won't take too long. I also think we should select more than one person, just in case. That way, we have a higher chance of one having a desire that matches the fourth king's. How long will this take?"

Leo knew they didn't have much time on hand.

"With all of us helping you, then not too long; maybe a couple of hours to get to your destination as long as we don't run into any trouble. However, the place is basically a war zone and a very chaotic one. But I believe that when they see three kings together, it should suppress any fighting, so everything should go alright.

"What I worry about is whether you will have a human strong enough to face him. Do you remember last time, with every second, the energy from your bodies naturally disappeared and went into the familiar world. This means humans might get even weaker as time goes on in that world. After a fight, they would have to rush back to the portal; it's a big risk."

Quinn knew it was a risk, which was why if he couldn't think or find anyone suitable, he would abandon this plan. The familiars would be able to support in the war, but it wasn't a guarantee they would help them win it, and he wasn't willing to sacrifice the others.

At the same time, there was another worry troubling Quinn. That was, if the war continued in the familiar world, that maybe, the Boneclaw and the other two kings would have to head back. Meaning they could no longer use them. Not that Quinn used the Boneclaw much in the first place, but if he relied on the latter and didn't have him in the time of need, things would get troublesome.

'Now, who would be best to suit a familiar, and who would be able to help us?' Quinn thought.

Once they found their contestants, it looked like Quinn would be heading to the familiar world, the place where the Boneclaw and the others lived.

*****

# Chapter 1469 - The Qi Candidates
All the invitees for the event were still staying in the northern part of the stadium. Everyone was dwelling in one place, so it was easier for them to communicate, and it also made it easier for Quinn to walk around with Leo and search for those who had strong signs of Qi.

At the moment, they were striding through a hallway and heading to the training room. What better place to find those who were strong?

Ovin was sprawled on Leo's head. It had been a while since he had been taken out, and he was enjoying his time. At the same time, they thought that maybe they could get some suggestions on who to pick from the cat. Since the conditions for a familiar making a contract weren't exactly crystal clear.

"Just so that we're on the same wavelength here," Quinn repeated. "There are two conditions: One, for the desire of the two to match up, and for the king to be attracted to the strong Qi in the contractor's body.

"The reason why we're thinking of humans is that if the Qi on its own is attractive enough, they would care less about the desire, correct?"

"How many times are you going to ask me?" Ovin yawned. "Yes, that's correct, and no, I don't know what his desire is. If we knew he would have left before the others, but think what your desire was that the Boneclaw was attracted to was. For me, it was the pursuit of strength. I could tell that this one is obsessed with refining his skills. Now, I don't know the reason behind it, and I don't care, but as long as he keeps looking to improve, that's alright with me."

It was a question worth pondering over because Quinn didn't know why the Boneclaw was with him. Or to be more precise, why it had chosen him. Wasn't it meant to be a creature that feasted on Quinn's dark desires? Perhaps that was the reason why he couldn't summon it at the moment. Still, Quinn couldn't help but think back to the strange actions the Boneclaw had done not too long ago.

'What does it mean? I just don't understand. You used to belong to Richard Eno. What is different between him and me, or maybe I need to find what is similar about the two of us."

Regardless the Boneclaw would still listen to Quinn from time to time, and if it thought Quinn was no longer any use to it or hated his apparent desire, then it would make no sense for the Boneclaw to continue protecting Quinn when it had done. Perhaps there was more in it than what the cat was letting on.

Inside the training room, there were those who just never stopped fighting for a second, aiming to improve thier skills. None of the vampire leaders were present. It looked like rather than the two sides getting along, they had decided just to put up with each other, apart from one.

The others in the room were sparring against each other, striving to improve as they had nothing else to do in the meantime, and inspired by the matches they had seen.

As for the only vampire leader in the room, correction, the Royal knight, who was present, it was Fex. He was sitting on the floor with his back against the wall, and sitting beside him was none other than Samantha. The two of them seemed to be talking, and Quinn saw a side of Fex which he had never seen before.

He looked quite shy, turning his head away constantly from Samantha. They hadn't had much time together after the confession, so it was clear their relationship hadn't developed, but at least it looked like things were going in the right direction.

It also took a lot for Quinn to ignore what the two were saying. It seemed Fex hadn't noticed Quinn had entered and could hear every word the two spoke.

"She has potential. The Qi force in her is quite strong already, but she has never been trained in it, nor has she naturally summoned it." Leo commented, seeing Quinn was looking in their direction.

Quinn was thinking; the main problem here was that Samantha was part of the Earthborn group and not the Cursed faction. For now, she was listening to them and Sach, but this didn't guarantee a hundred percent that she would stay on their side once this was all over.

However, seeing her speaking with Fex on good terms and not caring for who he was, had given Quinn some hope.

"I think we can ask her; you said the more people we have, the higher the chances, correct?" Quinn suggested.

They carried on walking around the room as Leo sensed their Qi. They would then tell them all once gathered about the task and see who wished to come and those who didn't. That's when they spotted Sil, with all his brothers.

"Sil is strong and is a human. Don't the blade family members have a lot of Qi as well?" Quinn thought aloud.

"Hmm, Sil seems to be an exception to that. He himself hasn't been through many tough situations, or at least not as many as the other Blades. It looks like he relies on his abilities a bit too much." Leo commented. "From the last visit, we know that that place will start draining Qi as soon as we reach there, and the situation would be even direr for Sil."

There were other candidates, such as Logan and others, but they all seemed to have small amounts of Qi that worried Leo, but there was someone in the room who had more Qi than any others.

"What about Layla?" Leo suggested. "Although she is a vampire subclass, and the rest of us have high amounts of Qi, I believe that there is still a good chance that the King could choose her as well."

Without a doubt, Layla had high amounts of her Qi. Not just her own, but from her mother as well.

Quinn was fine with this suggestion…at least he thought he was. These days, he would be more settled when he could see members of the Cursed faction in front of him rather than away from him. Perhaps due to what happened to Helen.

Finally, after looking around some more, they came across two others who had an acceptable amount of Qi in their bodies. One of them was one of the Unranked, Abdul, the bow and arrow user.

'We don't know the Unranked well at all, but Abdul is close to Sera, and I feel like I could trust him. Although Abdul won't be helping the fight against the Dalki, the fight against Pure is important as well, but I would the familiar choose someone else.'

"Oh, I think he might like that one," Ovin smirked and didn't really elaborate on why.

It was just when Quinn had somewhat made his decision that he wasn't the right fit for the familiar that he had said that. In the end, Quinn had to think if they would be better with the familiar than without, and he decided to go ahead since it was not only their concern but also that of the familiar world.

As for the last person, who also had a surprisingly good amount of Qi potential in their body, was someone Quinn hadn't expected.

"Him." Leo pointed at the person, and he was already a strong one.

As for who Leo was pointing at, it was Owen. As usual, he was talking to his grandfather and Hermes, with the fan covering his face.

In the end, they had gathered everyone with the high Qi and most potential to get a contract with the final king. They had pulled them off to one side, and even Fex, who had long noticed the group, has joined them, and with him, was Samantha.

Layla, Abdul, and Owen. If all went well and their journey to the familiar world worked out. One of these would be getting a strong familiar, which would boost their strength.

# Chapter 1470 - Unexpected Visitor
After gathering all of the participants, Quinn explained why they were here and how they would be transferring to another world to get what was called a familiar.

He also made it clear to them what the risks were and why they were selected. For one, there was always the risk that the familiar might attempt to kill its host at any point in time. However, it didn't seem to faze this group of individuals, and all of them even seemed more excited by the prospect of getting a familiar.

'I guess they all have been through a lot, so that would be expected.'

"As I said, you don't necessarily have to come, and even if you do come, only one of you will be selected; also, Leo, Oscar, and I will be heading there as well," Quinn explained.

It was then that the Unranked Abdul raised his hand.

"I'm okay with all of this, even though it sounds quite handy, but I kind of need to understand the risk to reward. How strong are these familiars, and how strong is this one?"

It was hard for Quinn to pinpoint their strength. They were helpful in several ways and couldn't die, which was a big plus, but as for how strong this one was, he couldn't imagine it being any weaker than the other kings.

"Hmm, I mean, all of you saw the power of the Horse that was out in the field. Well, that is the level of the familiar that we are after."

Flashbacks appeared in their heads of the strong Horse that easily ploughed through the hybrid beasts. And upon thinking that they might have a similar familiar with them, it made them even more excited.

"Was that horse that strong?" Samantha wondered since she was one of the ones who had passed out due to the gas. "I guess I don't really know what a familiar is like."

"I can show you," Fex said as he tapped his earring, and it started to light up, releasing a little bull with bat-like wings and a giant nose ring.

"Master!" Ham immediately started to fly towards Fex and grabbed onto his face. "I thought you forgot about me! You never talk to me these days, and you're getting so strong that I thought you… I thought you forgot about me!"

Fex immediately pulled off Ham and held him by the back of his wings, showing others the snotty-nosed flying Bull. Fex's face was a little red; he thought maybe he could score some points with Samantha showing something cute… however, this Bull looked anything but cute.

"What's his name," Samantha said as she reached out her hand and stroked the top of his head.

"Ham," Fex replied. "I don't bring him out much these days because it's dangerous, and I care about him a lot," He mumbled, not really knowing what he was saying but was just trying to gauge Samantha's reaction, who seemed to like the Bull.

As for the others watching, they all just hoped that they got something that looked a bit more helpful than that, something more like the Horse.

"Well, if you are all in agreement, then we will head off straight away," Quinn said.

The group first went to the canteen where Sunny was waiting. She would also be coming along on this journey. Although they had Ovin who could communicate with the familiars and help them out, Quinn felt more safe having someone he trusted.

On top of that, Sunny had insisted on joining since it was all her idea to begin with. After gathering in the canteen, Samantha couldn't help but stare at the large figure beside the former's side.

"Hey, so I'm not going to come with you on this one, alright?" Mona said, knocking his back a few times. "But Quinn is going to take care of you, so don't do anything crazy."

Those heading out will be Quinn, Oscar, Sunny, Samantha, Abdul, Owen and Layla, while the others will remain behind. Too many people would attract attention, and there was no need for the extra.

While everyone was getting ready, many said their goodbyes. Owen spoke to his Grandfather and Hermes, Fex with Samantha, and even Oscar and Mona had a chat with a book and pencil.

This left two people standing next to each other, who hardly had alone time in a while.

"It's nice, huh?" Layla said. "Everyone has someone, and I think the two of them make a good couple, don't you think?"

It was clear that Layla was talking about Fex and Samantha as Fex had a worrying expression and was telling her to be careful, even showing her a few punches here and there, which she could try.

"It is nice," Quinn replied. "And, I haven't forgotten. I promise I'll find a way to get rid of that -"

"You know." Layla cut Quinn off. "I used to think that Erin and Fex would make a good couple together if they spent more time together, but I guess it just never worked out.

"It's interesting, right? The more time you spend away from someone, no matter how strong those feelings were at one point in time, they start to fade, and then someone new comes into their view. I can't wait forever, Quinn…and I miss her. Erin, I mean. She left without saying anything to me, to anyone, and I wonder where she is?"

Hearing this, Quinn didn't know what to say; he wasn't really good at comforting someone.

"She's strong. Strong enough to make that decision." Quinn replied and closed his eyes.

Since at the moment, everyone was relying on a certain familiar of his. Entering the space and the connection with his familiar again, he could see the Boneclaw's form.

'At least he's appearing in front of me; earlier, he wouldn't even do that.' Quinn thought.

"I have a favour to ask-"Before Quinn could say anything, the Boneclaw started to disappear again. After what Quinn had just said about it, he thought it was playing a joke on him, that was until they could see it being summoned on the outside.

The large figure appeared in the middle, with its long dangly fingers that almost grazed the floor.

"This…this…" Abdul gulped. "What is this monster? This is your familiar?" Abdul had seen the mist come out from Quinn, so he could only assume.

"Yes," Quinn nodded. "He will be taking us to the other world."

"That's certainly frightening," Owen said, although they didn't look scared at all. "I hope there is something that suits my taste there. Something more beautiful and elegant."

The Boneclaw then started to draw a large circle with its finger, leaving a trail behind. As it finally connected, it opened a portal, and the group was ready to head into the familiar world.

——

A short while after Quinn and the others had left, a large spaceship arrived at the stadium. This was one of the ships belonging to the Cursed faction.

It was landing in the broken large area of the stadium that hadn't been repaired. Here Sam was waiting for them, as he had expected them to arrive.

When the ship landed, the ramp descended.

He saw Ashley step out first, with the rest of the vampire soldiers behind him in an orderly fashion. They all looked around carefully at the scene around them and could only imagine what type of fighting had happened here.

"It's good to see you again," Ashley said, saluting Sam.

This was a bit awkward for Sam since he didn't really impose military procedures on his people, but he returned one out of respect.

Just then, he noticed someone else behind Ashley slowly making there was down. She wasn't a vampire soldier and was an acquaintance of his, staring off into space.

"Hayley, it's nice to see you again," Sam said with an awkward smile.

"Yes, it's nice to see you as well. I was wondering where Quinn is? I wanted to talk to him about my father." Hayley asked.

*****

# Chapter 1471 - A Protecter
The group stepped inside the specially created teleporter, and they were on the other side in no time. The feeling was actually better and smoother than when they went through their own created teleporters. Many remembered their first experience as a few people would get sick, but the school trained the students well for that.

After stepping out, everyone started looking at each other. They were making sure each one of them was there and in one piece. Even Abdul was checking if all his fingers and toes were intact.

After the initial inspection, it took them a second or two to appreciate the new world they had arrived at. Unlike the beast planet, each of them could feel something different about the place. A mystic colour was enveloping the sky, a mix of purple and blues; even the trees, plants, and everything around them looked foreign and not even part of their universe, never mind the world.

Then there was the energy they felt, as if something was slowly slipping away from them. Leo recalled this feeling, and he could even see the little balls of energy flying around, or sense would be a better word.

The last to arrive through the teleporter was the Boneclaw, and as he stepped out, the teleporter soon disappeared.

Currently, the group was standing on mostly hard ground, with a few odd patches of purple, pink, or red-colored grass, randomly placed all over.

The Boneclaw bent down slightly and made and drew through the ground creating an x.

Then he looked at everyone else as if he wanted to say something.

Ovin, who was still on top of Leo's head, cleared his throat before speaking.

"Alright, listen up. The Boneclaw has used a lot of energy to open a portal between our two worlds. The thing is, moving in this world, you move in the real world as well. In simple words, if we want to head back to the stadium, we will have to come back to this spot.

"Then the Boneclaw will open another gate for all of us to head back." Ovin gave himself a triumphant nod, having translated everything. It was then that Quinn wondered if the Boneclaw would be coming with them on this journey. Just then, he could see it opening another portal and was leaving.

"Where is it going?" Quinn asked.

"This isn't his territory," Ovin answered. "Most likely, he's going back to check if things are alright back there, and he will need to borrow the energy from the others to open a teleporter to take us all back as well."

It made Quinn wonder if the Boneclaw could have just teleported them to their destination then, but it was probably due to the energy problem.

"You said all the kings have a territory, correct?" Sunny asked. "Then whose territory are we in right now?"

Ovin pointed towards the large figure with his paw, indicating that it was the Horse's territory.

"From here, if we keep up a good pace, it will take us around an hour or so to get there, but maybe they can help us out," Ovin explained.

"Is it not possible for you to create a portal and move us all to our right location?" Layla asked. "I mean, Quinn's familiar got us here, can't you at least do that?"

This comment had clearly frustrated the cat, and it looked like he was going to pounce off from Leo's head any second, but before he could, Leo grabbed his familiar and started to scratch it to calm it down.

"You see, we all have our advantages and disadvantages. The Boneclaw is just very good at using energy, and it's similar to his power in the first place. If you want me to create a fire that will burn you to ashes, sure go ahead. I'll be happy to do that." Ovin smirked.

Before stepping ahead to follow Leo and the cat, Oscar paused for a second as something appeared before him, and the others had seen it before. After a bright light shone, a horse with the green glow appeared, and it looked just as powerful as it did before.

The large figure then suddenly started to walk over to where Samantha was. She was unsure what he was doing but moving his one free hand, it looked like he wanted her to take it. As she took his hand, Oscar then led Samantha up to the Horse and lifted her on top.

"Well, I guess that makes sense since she's the only girl here," Abdul commented, and straight away, he felt two pairs of deathly stares on his back. One was coming from Sunny and the other from Layla.

"I meant, the one delicate girl… aren't you both vampires?!" Abdul cried back.

The next second, the Horse neighed, and when it did, the sound echoed throughout the land. It was strange the others could tell the Horse had made an incredibly loud noise, yet none of them felt like it was piercing or hurting their ears.

They waited a few moments, and eventually, several horses, smaller than the one itself but glowing white with a horn on their head, appeared.

"Unicorns! People will call me crazy if I were to tell anyone what I've seen," Abdul exclaimed.

"What? Vampires, headless men, and a bull with wings aren't crazy already?" Layla said, passing by him and now stroking the Horse.

"This is his territory," Ovin said. "And it looks like he's giving all of us a free ride. This will save us a lot of time. "

The others found it quite impressive; it seemed like they really were kings here; even the horses, when appearing, had given a slight bow, showing their respect.

Everyone got on a horse, most having one for themselves. At the same time, Quinn and Sunny had been left together on another. Leading the way were Leo and Ovin.

They thought that perhaps the large figure with his gigantic Horse would be leading the way since it was its territory, but it decided to ride alongside Samantha.

'Now I know, something's up. He's clearly treated differently compared to everyone else, but why? Does he like me?' Samantha thought, but it didn't seem to be the case based on the interaction it had with Fex. Either way, it wasn't doing her harm.

When the horses started to run, they didn't gallop or run like regular horses; instead, it felt like they were almost gliding. Each time their foot hit the ground, they would be propelled forward at an incredible speed, passing the landmass quickly.

There was something else that all of them were noticing as well. One of them was that all the familiars they came across were moving out of the way from them, allowing them all to pass.

The others were enjoying the sight as they looked at all the familiars in the distance, that was until part of their energy escaped from them, turning into a small glowing ball floating and drifting away.

They felt it. There was no need for an explanation, and they understood very well that the time they had was short.

It was then that the horses suddenly stopped dead in their tracks; not too far in the distance, a large hill could be, standing like a huge wall.

"What's that? Is that the place?" Abdul asked.

"The horses won't move further. This is the border of their land." Ovin said. "From this point onward, we need to be careful. I'm really not sure how they will treat us. They will either shower us with gifts, scurry away or attack us on sight."

Getting off the horses, the group began to move as they headed into enemy territory.

Just as they were about to reach the top of the hill, Owen said, "I have something to ask. You are a cat, the other is a horse, and Quinn's is… well, let's just call him special. I was wondering… what form or shape does this one take?"

The others were also interested in knowing the answer, as they had finally reached the top.

But just as Ovin was about to reply, others paused and stood their mouths wide open in surprise at the sight in front of them.

*****

# Chapter 1472 - Too Strong For This World
Everyone had paused for a second to look at what was in front of them after climbing up the hill. They were stumped at the scene because everything in front of them was destroyed and ravaged. Even now, they could see things still burning.

It was clear that a tremendous fight had taken place right here, if not a war. It wasn't like none of them had seen such a sight before, but compared to the scenic views that had just come across in the previous territory, it wasn't a wrong guess that this place must have also been quite beautiful. But even this couldn't escape from the ravages of war.

The land looked somewhat scorched but not by one's typical red flames as they would see. These flames nonetheless were boring down the ground and slowly disappearing.

Everything that was being destroyed was letting out a strange mystic mist that would add to the sky and more. Another reminder that this world and its actions weren't quite like theirs.

"What happened here? I mean, I know you said that there was a war between the familiars, but where are the familiars?" Layla asked since they didn't see any dead creatures on the ground.

It almost was as if everything had just vanished.

"When familiars die in this world, they just disappear," Ovin explained. "Their energy is then taken by the world and redistributed as you can see."

The others at first were wondering what Ovin was talking about, but soon they could see that once the flames had dwindled, the land was quickly becoming what it once was. The grass slowly grew, the trees reappeared, and even what looked like strange destroyed rocks were now reforming back into the shape they once were.

"This world is fragile, and there needs to be a constant balance. This world is alive the same as us familiars, which is why its energy is so important to us." Ovin explained. "But it will need more energy to restore itself to its previous state than the energy it's getting from the dead, which means that perhaps a purge might take place soon.

"Honestly, war in the familiar world doesn't help anyone. Even if a king were to wage war against another, then after the fight, the land would need to heal itself, taking more energy than required, and they would have to kill their own so they wouldn't destroy the world. It doesn't make any sense what that fat man is doing." Ovin said, surely annoyed.

While talking, one was staring intensely at the other side and even walked forward, placing his sword into the ground.

"I would suggest avoiding this area," Leo replied. "The land seems to be drawing energy from anything nearby at the moment, and it is hungry."

"Won't that take longer then?" Sunny replied. "If we have to find another way, then more energy will drain away from us anyway, and since this land is healing, then they can't be far. or at least those responsible for this can't be far."

"The old woman is right," Ovin claimed, although Sunny clearly didn't like the nickname. She folded her arms after hearing those words and even kicked the ground, sending a piece of it far off into the distance.

Seeing this, Ovin looked at her with the corner of his eye and thought he better calm down with the teasing if he didn't want to become that rock. "If the place was like this, then it means they are close. Perhaps an attack happened, and then they returned to their own territory. The fact that the Horse doesn't know about this yet just means that they fought and left this place recently."

The group moved forward onto the land. They now had to travel by foot, so their speed had greatly reduced. But the second they stepped on the land, they could feel energy escaping from their feat. It was a strange feeling as if someone was pulling on their insides, making them weaker by the second.

The land was even still growing around them, restoring itself. It looked like they were watching plants and trees grow on a timelapse but in person.

They sprouted, bringing new life in seconds.

The only one unaffected by the energy drain was Samantha, as she had stayed on the large Horse while everyone else walked. She didn't even have the choice to say anything; the large figure had already picked her up and placed her on the Horse. Not that she was complaining about not having to use her legs. She just thought she was getting special treatment like some type of princess. It made her worry a little about what the others might think of this, but no one complained. Well, nearly no one.

"You know, I'm starting to think Samantha doesn't need a familiar. She has that big guy protecting her, and he has the Horse anyway. She basically already has one. Don't you think it should be given to one of us?" Abdul said, smiling as he had hit Layla on the shoulder, thinking she would agree with him, but she just stared back at him, remembering what he had said earlier.

The group saw densely forested areas up ahead and in the distance two large mountains. It looked like an endless valley as the tree's continued like a tunnel past the mountains. But before they entered the forest, the Horse suddenly stopped. It plodded on one of its hoofs onto the ground two times, creating rings of green aura that went across the land. It looked like two ripples in water, only there was no water, and they were going through the air.

The green ripples went through everyone and continued until they eventually hit the forest trees and shook slightly.

"They're here!" Ovin shouted as he stretched out its back and jumped off from Leo. "It looks like we won't be getting the warm welcome I was expecting!"

When the ring of aura had hit the trees, they could see something on its trunk start to emerge. It was as if its body was changing, and a large black colour could be seen, but it was moving. Finally, when it lifted up from the ground, they saw two large heads; it looked like they were two giant snakes. Their bodies were as thick as the trees themselves.

They were disguised with camouflage, but the Horse had managed to see through it. The snakes opened their mouths wide, showing their two large, long fangs as they scurried off the trees and onto the floor towards them.

"You dare bare your fangs at me! Do you know who I am!" Ovin clamoured as it jumped up. The snake was about to snap at the small cat, but the latter slammed down on the top of its head before it could move. The snake was whacked to the ground, and in a few seconds, its body started to turn into balls of energy, similar to what the group had seen around themselves.

"Feel free to kill these guys. It's clear that they haven't learned their place, and by fighting against us, they no longer care about the world!" Ovin declared.

It was then that the group could notice a disturbance in the trees up ahead. All of them took a deep breath as they stared ahead because the enemy didn't have just a few snakes, rather a whole army.

Then, Quinn turned around to the others walking in front of them all.

"It's alright. If we can't get out of this, then what hope do we have against the Dalki."

When Quinn had his head turned towards them, the other remaining large snake near the tree charged straight towards him with its mouth wide open. The others hadn't seen the real Quinn fight for a while, and they were about to see what he could do first hand. Suddenly, the snake fell to the floor, collapsing before it even reached him.

They saw nothing, as it turned into particles like the others.

As they stared at Quinn, it felt like they were looking at a god, one who these insignificant creatures can't even touch.

*****

# Chapter 1473 - Out Of The Box
"Show off."

These were the first words that had come out of Ovin's mouth after he had seen what Quinn had done. The others weren't sure what had just happened as the familiar perished before even reaching Quinn.

However, there were a few who had noticed and knew what had happened. Leo, using his ability, was able to sense a short bust of Qi. It wasn't a large amount, but Quinn had shaped it into a sharp arrow, and he had formed it behind his back, similar to how he could control the shadow using the second stage.

Then finally, using the third stage of Qi, it went outward from his body, aiming directly at the familiar's head and killing it in a single blow. A short and powerful blow, an attack invisible to the naked eye.

'This place absorbs all of our Qi, which is why I don't wish to use it too much in a fight.' Leo thought. 'Yet Quinn, he was able to control it so well and easily and wasn't afraid to control the right amount. His Qi control and the amount in his body grow a lot.'

Quinn had felt the drain effect that Leo was thinking about, he knew that the best choice wasn't for them to use Qi while here, but he just wanted to test a few things. How bad it would be if they did use it and his own control over Qi. In the end, there was no telling what enemies they might face, and he could feel something else as well.

Their abilities, including that of his shadow, didn't seem to work perfectly in this place either. It wasn't that they couldn't use their abilities, but almost whatever they did use would escape from their bodies, not allowing it to restore.

'It's quite clear that we don't belong in this world, and it's almost as if the world itself is telling us this as well.' Quinn thought.

It hadn't been long since Quinn had learned the third stage of Qi, but recently he had been thinking about it more and more ever since he had learned of Qi command, as Quinn referred to it. There were many different things that one could do with it, and Quinn had no idea how he would even learn those things. Briefly talking it over with Leo, it seemed he didn't know about it either. The new stages of Qi and more were all a whole new world to him as well.

He had some theories on how they worked but had yet to test out those theories. Either way, Quinn was sure if Leo was unable to figure it out, he wouldn't be able to either.

So instead, he focused on improving what he knew best, and he realised something, his control with the second stage was his best out of the stages of Qi. The best way for him to use Qi was to shape it as he wished. He was so skilled at this because the way to do it was similar to how Quinn used his shadow powers.

The others didn't have time to idolise what Quinn had accomplished because they could tell that an army was heading towards them and would come out of the forest at any second.

"Hey, aren't you two kings as well? Can't you call in your own familiars to fight?" Abdul asked.

"My territory is far from here," Ovin replied. "Although the Horse' is nearest, he is counting on you guys. He doesn't wish to involve his people in this fight and hopes we can solve this ourselves."

Everyone readied themselves for battle, and the first thing that appeared across the forest were more snakes, All of them in different colours and patterns all over. Some heads were different from others, and their tongues were all different shapes and styles.

The sizes of them were vastly different as well. Some were as big as the first pair they had seen, as large as the trees, while others were as small as a grass snake on earth.

Just then, one of them opened its mouth, and a long tongue shot out.

Before it reached the group, Leo came in front and sliced the tongue to not hook anyone. But several snakes hissed, and even more tongues shot towards the group.

Layla had started to do the same with her sword. The familiars didn't seem strong, so there was no need for her to transform, and she thought it was a good chance to improve her sword skills as she watched Leo carefully as well.

As for Owen, he calmly placed a single hand on the ground and started an electric current along the surface. It reached far and wide and caused many of the snakes to perish. Others were frozen for a few seconds, and some were even resilient to his powers as they continued to crawl. His attack was the most effective to get rid of them all in one go because of the range.

"I see you guys will be fine without me. I'll go up ahead and stop more from coming out of the forest!" Quinn shouted as he ran and jumped over the snakes. Once in a while, he would find an open space on the ground and use that to leap again, ignoring most of the smaller snakes until he went off into the forest.

No one was really worried about Quinn, not after what he had done just shown them.

"Why did he just leave us? Is he taking it easy?" Abdul complained as he pulled his bow at the endless amount of snakes.

"No, Quinn cares about us more than anything," Layla replied. "If he left, it means he knows we can handle it."

Abdul wasn't so sure as he could see the number of familiars around them were increasing, and the cat was now back on Leo's head after killing a few snakes.

The fighting continued for a while, and Oscar remained near the horse, refusing to let Samantha fight. She felt awful because more snakes now surrounded them than the others, and she couldn't even fight.

Just then, a sudden large black snake, bigger than the first two they had met when they first entered the forest, came around from the back and got between the two of them. Oscar was already dealing with four giant snakes while Samantha remained on the horse.

Seeing this, Oscar had summoned the bone-like whip and started to hit them, slicing their bodies in half, but these snakes seemed not to be dying no matter how many times they were sliced and cut.

For some reason, Oscar wasn't using his bone-like summoning powers and could only form the weapons in his hands. Eventually, one of the snakes constricted around the box in his arm.

He could see the large snake surrounding the horse, and out of fear of what might happen, he dropped the box allowing the snake to constrict it further. The snake crushed the box within seconds, and out from the box, something popped from the top and landed on the ground.

Oscar jumped up onto the large familiar and ran across its body. Seeing its head up ahead, he threw out its bone-like whip, wrapping it around the familiar's head. As he pulled the whip, the bones on the whip dug into the skin more and more until they went through the giant snake's head, and it burst into particles once again.

Looking at the horse, Oscar wondered if Samantha was okay, but she was nowhere to be seen. But upon looking around, he found Samantha on the surface, walking towards something.

"Thank you for saving me." She said as she walked towards the object on the floor, it was facing the other way, and all she could see was its back. "I know this thing is precious to you. I see you always carry it around, but I always wondered what was inside it…"

That's when she paused for a few seconds; she was close enough to realise it was a human head.

*****

# Chapter 1474 - The Fat King
The fighting had mostly stopped around them. It seemed like the familiars quickly realised they were outmatched, as these newcomers hadn't suffered a single scratch. However, the humans and vampires also experienced how much quicker their energy was draining in the Familiar World.

Honestly, they weren't sure how much longer they would have been able to keep fighting the familiars. Leo noticed that even Abdul, who nobody had ever taught on how to use Qi, was using it subconsciously in his attacks, that's why his arrows had more power in them compared to a normal archer. In this case it wasn't a good thing.

The only one that was using next to no Qi at all was Owen.

'That man is certainly special, to be so powerful and have even more power inside him without even realising it.' Leo thought. 'I wonder just how much power he would have if he were to use Qi as well.'

As the fighting started to stop, the tenth family's Vampire Knight thought of something interesting as he walked over to the leader of the Graylash group. Meanwhile, towards the back of the group, Samantha had stopped in her tracks as she looked at something on the ground.

The reason she had stopped was because she could tell by the outline it was a head. During the war, she had seen people's heads get knocked off, splattered and destroyed. It wasn't a pretty sight, but it was something she had grown used to.

The reason Samantha stopped was because she saw no reason why anyone would be carrying around a head of all things. In the end, she decided to walk forward because there was something that was drawing her to the head, but she couldn't quite tell what it was.

Inching closer and closer, there was someone who could see what she was doing. The large figure wanted to scream and tell her to stop as he held out his hands, but no words could be spoken and for some reason, his powers weren't working either.

He tried to order the familiar to move instead, but by then it was too late, as Samantha had already seen what it was, and immediately she went to pick up the head. Normally she wouldn't have picked up the head, but noticing who it was, she felt compelled to. The young woman fell to her knees as she looked at the face.

"I…I…What have I done…" Samantha couldn't hold back her tears, and even then continued to look at the head that even now in this situation smiled at her. The large figure no longer moved and just stood there in place, helplessly listening to the cries of his daughter.

The others, turning around, were unsure what had happened. Leo and Owen somewhat knew, but the others had no clue. They stayed there for a bit out of respect, not saying anything, until Samantha stood up with the head in her hands.

Some would have thought her to ask the large figure why he was carrying around the head, why he had become like this, but Samantha already knew deep down as she walked towards the figure. All of it was because of the request she had made to a certain person. She held the head carefully like a baby and headed towards the armoured figure, before slowly giving him a hug, tears continuing to run down her face, as she sobbed.

Oscar, placed his hands around his daughter trying to give her some warmth, even though it was impossible in this cold body of his.

"I understand now… why you've been looking after me this whole time… I can't believe it. I really can't… I'm sorry… I'm so sorry… I was too selfish… Instead of respecting your wish… to allow you to finally rest… I've allowed him to turn you into this… just because I wanted you back… I wanted to see you again… I'm so sorry, father…" She continued to cry.

There were days that went past where Samantha was unable to think clearly. She was always worried about the decision she had made, wondering what had become of her father, Whether he was okay and each day she had regretted her actions. Now seeing him, she felt sorrow but at the same time, even though she knew it was selfish, she felt joy being able to hold him like so.

She didn't know if it was the armour, his touch felt cold, his hands that had no armour felt cold, which was only upsetting her even more and reminding her of what had been done.

Those who hadn't known the situation had overheard Samantha's cry and somewhat understood what was going on, but still couldn't believe what might have led to these strange circumstances.

'The Dullahan, the legendary creature, is a human's father?' Sunny thought, observing the situation. 'I wonder how this came to be…and I wonder if Quinn knew anything about this.'

While Sunny was thinking about her King, large noises seemed to be coming from the forest. Everyone turned to look in the direction, and they hadn't noticed, but the noises had been going off quite frequently since they had been fighting.

Now the fighting had stopped, they could hear it even clearer. They watched for a few seconds and wondered if they should head inside. It was the direction that they would be going in after all. A few seconds later, they saw a gigantic dark scaled snake with giant horns on the top of its head, and several eyes down its side, lifting its head.

It looked like it was chasing after something in the sky, and it was. The small figure that could be seen was Quinn. The snake was enormous, it was by far the biggest familiar they had seen since getting here, something that could be called a titan.

It was hard to tell if it was hurt, for familiars didn't seem to get wounds on their body. Their energy would just continue to weaken before they eventually disappeared, but it didn't matter, as the familiar missed Quinn and he landed on the top of its head. Then, with his hand, he slammed it down as hard as he could.

It was almost a repeat of what they had seen Ovin do, only this was a snake that was twenty times the size and looked twenty times as fierce.

"I guess while we were busy here, our King was busy fighting that." Sunny commented.

When the snake hit the ground, the whole place shook for a few seconds, and then particles started to spread out just like it would do when any of the other familiars had been killed.

"We should go see Quinn." Samantha said, wiping away her tears. "Me and you can catch up, after this, okay?"

The group was ready to move to where Quinn was, even before that, he had already returned to the other's position.

"That was a little harder than I thought. For a second, I thought he was the fourth King."

"Hang on, you mean that WASN'T one of the Four Kings?" Abdul was shocked. Seeing how many snakes there were, he was sure that the leader of this place would have to be here. If it wasn't that giant snake, didn't that mean there was an even bigger one nearby?

"I know what you're thinking, but no, that fatso isn't a snake." Ovin commented. "Anyway, good job, young kid, with that it looks like you've got the attention of that guy."

It was then that the entire ground started to shake once more, but it wasn't small like it would be when something struck the ground. Instead, this was constant and was going on for a long time.

"What is happening?" Layla questioned, a bit panicked, as she rushed over to grab onto Quinn.

"I wasn't joking when I called him fat." Ovin clarified.

Off in the distance, they could see that pieces of the mountain were falling, breaking off slowly. Suddenly, a large hand broke through, far bigger than any they had ever seen.

"I think he might have gotten fatter." Ovin said.

*****

# Chapter 1475 - A Giant…?
The mountain was huge. It wasn't small by any means, and due to the distance, it was making it even harder for them to comprehend just how big it was, but without a doubt, it was no smaller than those on earth.

Yet they had seen a colossal hand rupture through the mountain. It was moving at an incredibly slow pace for its size. Still, loads of rocks started to roll down the mountain top as the shaking continued underneath everyone's feet.

"That damn fatty, does he not care about the world!" Ovin shouted. "He sleeps in those damn mountains, breaks out of them, and the whole world suffers because of the energy it takes for restoration. It's like he doesn't even care about the energy that is all around us."

Although a lot of them had negative opinions of Ovin, and always found it strange how a fat cat could call others fat, there was one thing they were all sure about. He cared about this place.

"Maybe that's the reason the familiar never contracted anyone because he only cares about himself?" Sunny speculated.

The others were trying to figure out just what was coming out from the mountains, but with only a large strange dark scaled arm to go by, it was nearly impossible. The arm looked human, yet at the same time, it was unlike one.

"Let's not stand around here and head towards the familiar then," Quinn suggested. "We are going to meet him anyway, and it looks like it's going to take him a while to get out of the mountains."

With Quinn making the first move, the rest followed as well. However, Quinn paused for a second as he stared ahead. He noticed that a box that he would usually see with them was no longer there. Oscar was holding onto his head with the creepy smile by his side. He no longer had it in the box that he usually would carry it in.

This meant that Samantha knew who the large figure was without a doubt. As they were making their way through, now Samantha and Oscar were both riding on top of the horse, and they decided to approach Quinn's side.

"I saw the look you gave and the face you pulled back then Quinn," Samantha said. "Your face really shows all your feelings; you're bad at hiding your thoughts."

This was the first time Quinn had heard something like this, but maybe others were too nice to tell him. Was it always obvious what he was feeling on his face? Now he was starting to become somewhat self-conscious.

"I know you know something; what happened to my father and maybe even about the person who took him away at that time. I won't question you about it now, but it would be best if you tell me all about it when we get back."

Quinn nodded because he also knew it wasn't the right time, but Oscar's actions were strange. From what he could remember, Oscar should have had no memories of what had happened, at least when he asked him that was the case, so why did he remember Samantha and protect her?

Perhaps they would find out the answers to these questions later on. Going through the forest, it looked like there were still many familiars, and not all were snakes, but they were all making way for the group, or maybe they were heading back to the mountain area.

"If that familiar always sleeps in this condition, how is he starting wars from up there?" Abdul asked.

"They pray to the mountain, and he answers them, I guess," Ovin said. "Honestly, I try not to mess with the other's business, but maybe he gets familiars to just sacrifice themselves to him by jumping into the top like a volcano."

It was clear that Ovin didn't like this man, but it still didn't stop Abdul from asking his next question.

"So, I was just wondering, out of all the familiars, which one of you is the strongest? I don't mean with your followers, etcetera… but on an individual basis."

Everyone glanced at Abdul for a moment as they continued to run forward. They couldn't believe that he was asking such a question at a time like this. Of course, they all had the same thought on their mind, but it just felt like asking such a thing was, well, rude.

"Do you think we had a big tournament and fought each other to determine that type of stuff?" Ovin complained. "We aren't as stupid as you humans… although, he could be."

The mountain rocks continued to fall, and finally, a second hand came out. The group was about halfway through when they realised that whatever it was, it was really slow but made up for it in size.

"Ovinick, Dunluck! I see you have personally come here!" A loud voice boomed, making the whole ground tremble.

It was unclear if the voice came from the mountain, under the ground, or was directly transmitted into their heads.

"Genbu! Look what you are doing, how many familiars have you taken out? Are you doing this just because you are jealous?!" Ovin yelled back.

They soon reached the foot of the mountain and now could just see how huge it was. However, the familiar still hadn't come out from the mountain top.

"Jealous of you who abandoned this place? I am the one who cares about this place the most, which is why I always remain here; I even sleep in this world!" Genbu, the familiar king, shouted.

"Step back!" Leo shouted. He could sense a rise in energy coming from the mountain through his vision. So far, he had felt only energy in the arms that he could see, but now he sensed the whole figure gathering energy inside.

With Leo moving away, the others did too, and they ran back through the trees to the mountain on the other side.

Although Leo could feel the energy and was frightened, it still looked like the familiar hadn't broken out yet, even after ten minutes as they arrived at the base of the other mountain.

"What the hell? You got me scared and panicked for no reason!" Abdul's complexion scrunched. He wasn't like the others; it was incredibly tiring for him every time he ran. He didn't have any special attributes like lighting foot technique. He did have the power of the wind that allowed him to somewhat keep up with the others, but it was very tiring for him.

"Ah, screw this, just come out!" Abdul shouted as he drew his bow and fired it towards the mountain. The others didn't see any arrow leave but knew he had launched the attack, and the next second, the whole mountain top crumbled as the familiar broke through it all. He appeared like a devastating massive monster.

The rocks fell from the creature, and that's when it fell on its stomach. The familiar could not stand upright on its back legs, and now with the destroyed mountain, it could no longer keep itself upright as it started to fall.

The others were a little afraid that it might flatten them, but Ovin looked calm, as he knew they were in the right spot not to get hurt. The familiar crashed into the ground, destroying all the trees and forest below him.

And now its head, almost the size of a blip, was staring at the group in front of him.

"This is the familiar!" Abdul said, looking at its eyes. From a little further back, one could see its whole body. It had large back scales on its arms and legs, its small tail sticking out of the back, and its long neck with a head-on top was in their direction. But, the most standout feature of the creature was the purple shell it had on its entire body.

'It's a turtle!' Everyone.

"You have made the wrong choice coming here. Now all of you must leave this world. I will continue to protect and be the guardian of the familiar world as its only king!" Genbu clamoured.

*****

# Chapter 1476 - The King's Bad Sense
The last king and the familiar they had been waiting for was a giant turtle, and it was safe to say it was as big as the mountain they had seen earlier. It was so large and its shell so big that it could even be confused as a small island if it swam across a body of water.

Nonetheless, this didn't change the fact that all of them were staring at the familiar, as it attempted to start a war between all of the kings.

"You really have gotten bigger; soon, there won't be a mountain on this whole land that can hold your body," Ovin commented as it jumped down from Leo's head and stepped forward. It was the first time for some of them to think the cat was quite fearless.

The whole size of the entire fat cat's body was the same size as the turtle's nostrils.

"Wow, this has got to be the strongest familiar; I mean, look at that size!" Abdul expressed his amazement.

"Size isn't everything, you know," Layla replied almost instantly, and her face went a little red, realising how improper that comment might sound.

Besides them, Oscar got off from the Horse and helped Samantha down from it, which she willingly accepted his help now. The Horse then strode forward and stood by Ovin's side. Its nostrils were puffing, and the green smoke from its nose was getting larger and fierce.

"You two. Do you really think you have the right to grumble? If you care about this world, you shouldn't have so freely abandoned it!" Genbu glared.

It was a strange sight to see, they couldn't see the turtle moving its mouth, yet somehow it seemed to be still able to talk to the rest of them and even express its emotions.

"Are you an idiot!" Ovin shouted back. "We contracted to supply energy to our lands, and what are you doing? Just destroying yours, causing the energy to recede from the land."

"Listen, I'm supplying the land with my own energy, which is given to me by the others in this area!" Genbu shouted back. "We don't have a fraction of the amount of energy that your lands do, but the second that my familiars try to enter yours to borrow some, you familiars attack! If you care about this whole world together, then shouldn't you share the energy equally!"

"Neigh…Neigh!…" The Horse expressed.

"Dunluck has a good point; they could have talked about these matters rather than battling it out. Communication is key when they are all sharing the world." Sunny said, explaining what the Horse had said.

Quinn had forgotten that she could understand what the familiars were saying.

"What are we meant to do now?" Quinn asked. "Since they talked about the war, I was half expecting us to have to fight, but it doesn't seem like it's the case right now. However, the situation could turn at any second. If we can avoid a fight, that might be a good thing."

Sunny started to walk towards the kings and looked back at Quinn.

"Why don't you just leave it to me."

When arriving, the others looked at who dared to be brave enough to interrupt them when they were in the middle of an argument. Still, when Sunny started to speak, a soothing feeling came over them all, making the situation incomprehensible.

"We are here to help you solve your situation," Sunny said. "If you also wish to have great energy for your land, then it would be best if you make a contract. We have brought great capitates with us, and all of them have strong energy to contract with you.

"In return, we wish for you to help us fight and borrow your power. It's a fair deal, wouldn't you say?" Sunny had her hand held out, gesturing towards the others behind her.

The turtle moved its large head, peeking over the cat and casting a shadow, looking at others. It then stretched it out and looked directly at Quinn.

"This one is so weak."

The others hearing this were beyond shocked. The grand turtle had just called Quinn, who was perhaps by far the strongest among all of them, weak. The turtle then moved its head along the others; next in line was Samantha. "Interesting."

Next was Layla. "Pathetic."

Then Leo. "This one looks like he lacks discipline."

Abdul. "A strong-looking warrior."

And finally, Owen. "Hmm, not worth my time."

The turtle then moved its head back to its original position and looked at the cat.

"You call these your great candidates? Most of them are useless. Where are the ones whom you have contracted with?"

It was then that Ovin and the Horse indicated who their contracts were with, and they even explained who the Undead king had contracted with as well.

"Oh…" the turtle voiced, not saying much else.

The situation was strange, and Ovin too found it odd because, without a doubt, even those who had travelled with them would have clearly said that the turtle was outright wrong.

"Let me ask you, out of everyone here, who do you think has the weakest energy?" Ovin asked.

The turtle then gestured at Quinn with its head.

"Of course, it's this one. I doubt he can even beat a single familiar; he might actually collapse at any second now."

Now, Ovin thought he had figured it out. There was something that some familiars couldn't do, and he had heard of some familiars in this situation before. Still, he would have never imagined it would be the same with a king.

"Genbu, tell me the truth… you… can't sense energy?" Ovin asked.

The turtle's head began to go back in its shell. The scene would have looked quite cute if it wasn't for its giant size.

"You mean… you can't sense energy at all?! The energy from them, or when a drop of blood comes into our world, or even when the world is damaged… you can't sense it?" Ovin yelled.

In all the years he had been with him, had seen him, Ovin had never thought that this would be the case. Now it was starting to make sense about his rash reactions and, at the same time, why Genbu perhaps had never formed a contract with anyone during his whole lifetime.

For a king, it was embarrassing to have the inability to sense the energy. What will happen if you form a contract with someone who turns out to be weak?

Still, Ovin couldn't help but laugh and roll on the ground on his back.

"A king who can't even sense energy…hahaha, no wonder you never contracted with anyone!"

The turtle was getting enraged, and everyone was afraid that Ovin's action might lead to a fight to break out soon.

"I assure you that all of these candidates here are just as good as the ones who have formed contracts before. Unfortunately, we who have already been contracted are unable to form more contracts, so feel free to choose any out of these," Sunny explained. "Also, if you need help and wish for them to match a desire of yours, that will be good as well."

The three candidates then decided to stand next to each other in a line while the others went away, making it easier for the turtle to see. It looked at each of them.

"This is hopeless!" Genbu declared. "I can't tell which one of you is the strongest, and my only desire… is to help my land. So I will decide through a test!"

Just then, the turtle began to shrink in size. It was getting smaller by the second, and its large body shrank down until it became smaller than a Dalki. And it now stood on the same ground that the others were currently on.

"For the sake of my land, I will test to see who is the strongest out of you all! Each one of you is to attempt to attack my shell, and I will form a contract with the one who I feel is the strongest!"

*****

# Chapter 1477 - A Hard Shell
After their little skirmish with the snakes a while ago, if there was one thing that all of them were grateful for, it was the fact that they wouldn't be rushing headfirst into another fight.

They all knew that there was a chance that they could be going head first into a war before coming here. They were warned about that. No one wanted to lose their life for a war that had little meaning to them, though.

Many of them were already risking their lives for war elsewhere.

Still, everyone knew the longer they remained in this world, the more energy would be sapped away from their bodies, even if they just stood there without moving an inch. So whatever the Turtle had planned, they wanted to get it over and done with.

It seemed like the Turtle, the fourth king whose name was Genbu, had prepared a test for them. With the test, the winner would receive the grand prize of forming a contract with the last king. Although many of them felt there was no need for a test in the first place, it was still better than the other option.

The group was following the Turtle as he asked all of them to get on its back. And since Ovin was fine with getting on the king's back, the rest didn't hesitate after seeing this.

"Everyone, just hold on tight," Genbu said once everyone had safely sat down.

"Hold on, we saw how 'fast' this Turtle could move; who does he think he's kidding?" Abdul commented.

The others agreed, and they also noticed that there was nothing to hold onto. They were just on a hard shell. Genbu's body then started to transform just like before, getting larger and larger by the second.

It was incredible how fast he could change his form, and soon the cramped space on the Turtle's back had gotten so large that it was hard for them even to see the edge. He was soon as big as his form was previously.

Since he had grown so fast, the others felt the force as he grew, being chucked up in the air slightly, and now they understood what he meant by hold on. Many of them, including Abdul, held on to the horse's legs for support as the latter stood as if glued to the Turtle's shell.

While the others had landed back down on the shell, not sustaining damage as they steadied themselves when landing.

"It's not over yet," Ovin said.

Adbul had let go of the horse's leg to wipe his forehead, believing it was all over, but just then, Genbu began to reduce as fast as he had enlarged earlier. Abdul quickly grabbed onto the horse' leg and closed his eyes.

After a few moments, the Turtle completed the process. Upon opening their eyes, the group saw that they were now all in front of the mountain on the other side— opposite of the one that had been destroyed because of Genbu's wakening.

"Come on, you idiot," Layla said, walking past. "I don't know why, but the Turtle thinks you're the most impressive one. We need to leave this place with a contract but don't forget there's a possibility that he might not make one with any of us."

When Genbu was smaller, they noticed that he could move far faster than in his enlarged form. In fact, it looked strange because the Turtle was only slightly slower than the horse. Upon entering the mountain, they found it nearly just as beautiful as it was outside.

A lot of them were expecting it to be dark and gloomy, but they were surprised to see that the inside walls were also coloured in the same mystic pattern as the sky and what was even stranger was, it was as if the walls of the mountain were alive and were slightly shifting upward like a river with a reverse stream.

Then finally, they could see what Genbu had led them to a large space. They saw several of what could only be described as turtle shells at the very end of the space, and they were all arranged at the back. The shells were about the same size as a small house.

"You keep your shells in here; are they some sort of fashion statement?" Ovin asked.

The others couldn't; help but chuckle at the comment. The way they were lined up certainly did make it seem that way.

"No. I shed my shell every once in a while, which is what is left of them. But let me assure you that each one of them is as sturdy and strong as the one I have right now." Genbu explained as he walked up to the shells.

"Shed? Like a snake? I didn't know Turtles shed their shells, and how would that exactly work?" Layla questioned.

The others now had a strange image in their head as they imagined a Turtle taking off his shell, but due to Genbu having the ability to resize himself, it did somewhat make some sense to them.

"You, the weakest, come over here," Genbu called.

The others looked at each other, wondering who Genbu was referring to. In the end, Quinn was the one who walked forward as others noticed that Genbu kept looking towards his direction, and he had referred to the former as weak a couple of times now.

"I have brought the weakest one of all of you to start my test. I would like to assess your strength, your powers, your energy, and your technique. I want you to use all of your power and strike the shell." Genbu explained.

"Each one of you will strike a different shell in this room, and they all have the same level of sturdiness. This way, you can't complain that perhaps another person weakened it beforehand. I shall form a contract with the one who can deal the most significant damage to one of these shells.

"Of course, you still have to impress me. If each of you is useless, then I shall form no contract, and just to prove to you how strong the shell is, I have called one of you to test its strength." Genbu said, giving Quinn a nod.

It seemed like he wanted Quinn to hit the shell as hard as possible to demonstrate its hardness, and the others seeing this were a little nervous.

'What should I do?' Quinn thought. 'Maybe I should just hit the shell normally. How about I use any Qi or my blood powers and just hit the shell at fifty percent? It should be able to take that much, right? These are one of the four king's shells. They should be sturdy, and it won't look like I'm holding back.'

Preparing himself, Quinn stood in front of the shell. He didn't get in any fighting stance or perform any actions he would perform to maximise impact, like in the hammer strike. Not that it would be effective anyway as it dealt internal damage rather than external.

Whatever he did now, he wanted to make sure that the others looked more impressive than him.

"HU!" Quinn shouted out loudly, giving the idea that he was using his full strength. His fist slammed into the outside of the hard black case, and everyone heard a loud bang.

The shell was left perfectly intact. There were no cracks or marks on the shell at all; Quinn had achieved what he was hoping for.

"See, the shell is one of my strengths, and it is what has allowed me to become king in these parts. Although I have to say, you were more impressive than I thought, and I can understand why the Undead king chose you."

As he walked back and rejoined the group, the other could tell he hadn't used his full strength or other techniques, and now it was down to them to impress the king.

Samantha lined up on the first shell, Abdul the next one, then Layla, and lastly, there was Owen. These four would punch the shell one after the other, and the Turtle Genbu stood back, observing all four of them.

"Begin!" Genbu shouted.

*****

# Chapter 1478 - Unlocked Talent
For a while, Quinn inspected the shell, and he could see it was in perfect condition.

He walked back to the others after punching the black turtle shell and could see Sunny giving him a wink. It was obvious to her what Quinn had done, and she thought it was the right decision.

It was best for the Turtle not to know of Quinn's strength. Otherwise, perhaps the Turtle would try to find someone with similar strength as Quinn, complaining about how the undead king had managed to find someone so powerful.

Then they really would have been at a loss. She was just thankful that Quinn hadn't attempted to show off in that situation. Still, those who needed to take part in the test now were a little nervous.

"I would suggest that each of you hit that shell as hard as you can; otherwise, you will have a hard time breaking it," Quinn commented. He had felt it with his own hands, and the truth was, he would have liked to test if he could actually break it or not.

These days when Quinn would come across a new type of beast or enemy, he had made it a habit to think of ways to defeat them. So, when Quinn had seen the turtle shell, he had focused on visualising how he would deal with it.

If its shell was sturdy, then there were many other points that he could attack and hurt the Turtle, but it was about damaging the shell in this test, not fighting the Turtle.

'The Dalki skin also gets tougher as they get stronger, and that was one of the main problems when facing off against five-spike Dalki. If Graham has gotten stronger…no, if the whole of the Dalki have gotten stronger, then we will be facing enemies with similar sturdiness. This will be a good test for them all.'

The one who lined up against the first shell was Samantha, and before taking her punch, she wondered how best to approach the situation. Genbu stated that they could use whatever they wished to damage the shell, but they could only hit the shell once. The other condition, which was a little strange, was that it had to be a hit, like Quinn had done, with a fist or a kick, which was why she struggled a little to make a decision.

"How do you think it will go, Tenth Knight?" Sunny asked.

"Although Samantha has good potential in Qi, and even though this is the reason she has been able to stay in this world without any hardship, she has had no training, so it will be more about how well she uses her ability."

Finally taking a deep breath Samantha, readied herself.

'Before, I thought I needed to get stronger for revenge on One Horn for doing that to my father. I thought after seeing him, my determination might falter a little…but that isn't the case at all. I need to get more powerful, so the next time I don't lose him again.'

The ground from below her feet started to move around Samantha's fist, making it somewhat pointed. Seeing as it was a shell, she thought she needed to focus most of her power on one point. Next, activating her soul weapon, the tip of the outside looked to be covered in a strange metallic colour.

"AHHH!" Samantha shrieked as she threw her fist forward as hard as she could. The image in front of her was of One horn himself, and it was at that moment she felt something rising in her.

"I guess I was a little bit wrong. Maybe it's this world, but it seems she has somewhat improved." Leo commented.

Because he could see that the internal Qi energy had somewhat activated on its own, giving her power of the first stage of Qi, it would interact with her body, allowing her to deliver the strongest punch possible.

It crashed into the shell, and the sparks emitted from it surprised Genbu a little. This was something that hadn't ensued when Quinn hit the shell.

At the shell, Samantha could feel a force almost repelling her. She continued to push forward as she felt a strange power rising inside of her until the metallic point had snapped off from the base of the earth and fallen to the ground.

It caused the rest of her fist with the earth to hit the shell and then crumble to the ground. Although the earth tip with her soul weapon hadn't broken by the base, she had failed her task.

She felt disappointed but, at the same time, looked at her arm, wondering what the energy that had risen in her body was. She had used so much of it, and now she began to feel incredibly weak because they were in the familiar's world.

Seeing this, Leo was about to move forward, but of course, the headless man had done so first, holding her up and taking her back.

"Oh, you weren't wrong when you said you brought some interesting ones," Genbu commented. "But it looks like I was right. Even if I can't sense energy, I will trust my intuition. I did say she had talent, and the others are weak; I am now expecting a lot from the other one."

Some looked towards Quinn, expecting him to be annoyed by these comments, but he just shrugged them off. He wasn't going to get upset just because some familiar called him weak; besides, he knew his strength and was in a good mood seeing how much Samantha had improved.

"Now I am looking forward to the next one!" Genbu turned to the man who had a bow on his back, and he was the one that Genbu believed to have the most talent.

"Alright, I'll crack this shell. Of course, I will!" Abdul said. He had a plan; although he couldn't shoot one of his sharp arrows at the Turtle's back, he decided upon something else.

He held the bow in his hand and formed a sharp arrow with his wind ability.

With this, as soon as he first touched the shell, he would fire an arrow as well, and using the beast weapon's power, it would give him more force into his punch.

'My sharp arrows can pierce almost anything, and it won't fail me now!' This is what Abdul thought.

It didn't take long for him to attempt his attack, as he threw his fist forward with the bow being held in one hand. The others then saw the string being pulled back, and it was doing so on its own without any help from his other hand, which the others found impressive.

It again slammed into the shell, his hand laid there on top, and a smile was still on Abdul's face. The shell certainly hadn't cracked completely; it was still intact, but Adbdul still had confidence.

He was expecting to see a hole after removing his hand, but nothing was there. At the same time, the strange purple sparks that had flashed when Samantha had attacked, didn't appear either.

"Huh? What the…how is his shell so strong?" Abdul said, flabbergasted. He couldn't even hide his surprise that the punch hadn't punctured it. His wind ability was so refined that it should have sliced through anything.

Even if it didn't make a hole as he expected, he did hope to see a scratch. He noticed that the shell was in perfect condition upon bringing his eyes closer.

Abdul just walked with slumped feet back to the others. It was clear that he had failed.

"Well…I guess my intuition is not that perfect." Genbu cleared his throat, a bit embarrassed by this result. "Still, there are two more to go, and although the woman did well, she had failed to impress me.

"The other two will have to do better than her if you wish for me to form a contract with you." The Turtle grumbled.

It looked like it was all down to Layla and Owen in the end. One of them needed to succeed.

# Chapter 1479 - The Strongest Participants
Of those they had brought along, two had failed Genbu's test, and Sunny, who had suggested this plan, was a little worried. They had brought along these individuals believing the fourth king to be a picky type of individual, but their assumption was wrong. Now he was testing them based on strength, but they hadn't selected these participants based on their raw power, just based on their Qi.

"Can I ask, if you can't sense energy, then why is it so important that the participant needs to be strong? You care about energy for your land, and I can promise you that any of them can assure a huge amount of energy." Sunny said, putting on her usual voice.

The turtle and other familiars smiled whenever they would hear her speak, and Quinn assumed this had something to do with her ability. Even though the family could communicate with familiars, she still spoke the same way as they all did so everyone could still understand her.

"I have no way to confirm what you say is true, and if I end up listening to one of the other kings, I will become a laughing stock," Genbu replied. "All of those in my territory rely on me. If my area lacks energy, I will have no choice but to stay with the host.

"I understand that the energy the one can provide and his or her strength doesn't mean they will match. However, even if I was to find someone with good energy like the first girl, and she cannot break my Shell, it means she is more likely to die. If she dies for being weak, then the contract would break, and I will have to look for a new person.

"I need someone strong and one that can provide energy to my land for a long time."

Sunny hated to admit it, but what the turtle said made sense.

"That's why I could never pick someone as weak as that young man over there."

Sunny tilted her head to look at Quinn, who still had a smile on his face. She wondered if the taunts were adding up and were beginning to get to him somehow because it was hard to tell with his facial expression. For a second, though, she believed she could see Quinn's eyebrow twitch.

The next one in question was Layla, and although the others didn't say it, they actually had a lot of hope for Layla. Out of all those participating, she had the highest amount of Qi.

"I can go all out, right?" Layla asked as she looked around.

The others nodded, and hearing these words, Genbu thought that perhaps he might have made a mistake in her evaluation and was about to see quite a spectacle.

"Please, I would love to see someone destroy one of my shells," Genbu smirked.

She then started to focus as she consumed the negative energy from her surroundings. The dark smog that only she could see, but it wasn't enough. She needed to skip to the fourth transformation to use her full strength, but there wasn't enough negative emotion around her.

'Cia, Erin, mother…Quinn.' Layla thought.

As she brought up her negative feelings, the energy from within started to fill her body, growing slowly. The strength in her body was rising. Her fangs began to grow but not as significant as they would do in her other forms, and her horns extended slightly but not too big just enough, so they were sticking out of her hair.

Her transformation into her fourth form was complete.

"Oh, well, I guess my evaluation really was wrong. I never knew that you could transform! It looks like you were hiding things from me all along." Genbu happily said.

The others were pleased that Genbu was getting excited because they needed him to complete a contract.

Abdul, who had already had his turn, was looking at Layla, wondering what was going on; even here, he could feel the energy coming off her body.

"She wasn't invited to the event, the event where the strongest were called. She…she can't possibly destroy that Shell, can she?"

"That event was based on who the Board thought was the strongest," Quinn replied. "There are plenty of people in the Cursed faction who have strong power but have never appeared in front of a camera or made a name for themselves, and Layla is one of them."

The first part for Layla was complete, but looking at the Shell, she felt like she needed to do more than just hit it.

"Am I able to move the shell with my ability?" Layla asked.

"Whatever you wish, as long as it is a single hit using your hand," Genbu replied.

Hearing this, Layla stepped back away from the Shell, moving more towards the centre of the room. The others had to step back, making space for her. When she was ready, she held one hand out, her palm opened while the other turned into a fist.

The Shell started to lift off the ground and was now floating slightly above the ground in the air. The Qi was building up in her body with the first stage, powering the muscles in her arm and strengthening her hand.

She then went on to use the second stage, coating the exterior of her fist as well. In this situation, the third stage of Qi wasn't really much help, so she just focused on the second stage.

"AHHH!" Layla cried, and the Shell started to rush forward in her direction. It moved faster than the others thought it would. Layla had also been focusing on improving her ability powers while practising Qi.

Before, she had reached her limit as a human and her subclass, but she noticed something else. After going to the next form, she could surpass her limit. Not only did her normal strength increase, but her ability also improved.

The Shell was coming right at her and throwing her fist out at the right time. It landed right on the Shell.

The Shell stayed still in the air for a few seconds, and the purple sparks that had appeared the first time when Samantha had hit the Shell appeared this time as well.

The sparks were far more fierce and were even running up and down the entirety of Layla's arm. They seemed to be somewhat repelled, as the second Qi coating she had produced on her arm allowed the sparks to be knocked away.

The power from the punch even shook the mountain a little, the surface trembled, and after a few seconds, the Shell finally fell on the floor. Layla, herself, felt like collapsing, but instead, she quickly changed out of her form and fell to her knees. She had been holding her breath the whole time.

For the first time, rather than have the participants inspect the Shell, Genbu himself moved towards it to examine. He looked and observed for a long time before concluding.

"You did far better than I thought. I think I can see a few scuff marks on the surface, but that's it. The Shell is perfectly intact, and even if you were to hit it ten times with the same punch, there would be no difference. I'm afraid you too are not good enough." Genbu declared.

This was not what the others expected; even Abdul was left with his mouth wide open. If she couldn't please the turtle, then who among them could? He only imagined that someone like Sera or Sil was strong enough to destroy the Shell and impress Genbu.

Now it was time for the last person, and they all turned towards Owen.

"Well, don't you all stare at me like that," Owen said. "I have no trick up my sleeve, and I couldn't even break the glass in the arena back then. I guess we can only trust in luck right now. It would have been better if you had brought that other leader with you." Owen chuckled.

As usual, the tension felt by the others didn't seem to phase him. The others were racking their heads because it didn't give them confidence about what to do, and just then, someone stepped forward with a solution.

"Could you please give us a little time before the next test? I won't need too long." It was Leo who spoke.

"Oh…I could give you some time, but I will be watching your moves so that you don't try to trick me in some way." The turtle said as he watched Leo walk over towards Owen.

"If you will allow me," Leo slightly bowed to Owen. "I wish to teach you Qi, in order to increase your strength."
