# Chapter 1770: Who is Athos?

Inside the celestial space, more Celestials were starting to gather around one particular ball of white energy. In the end, special space around the white ball was increased to accommodate everyone inside, and now there were about fifteen Celestials, all talking and discussing amongst themselves.

The floating ball known as Xox didn't like what was happening. There would have been a sheen of sweat running down his ball if it was possible.

"All the nearby celestials have caught onto what is happening. It's only a matter of time before this spreads and the others find out... But, unfortunately, I haven't seen any others from Earth come here yet."

"I don't think they have even caught onto what's happening, and they never even visit this place often in the first place!"

They were using the white ball of energy to follow the two individuals fighting each other not too long ago. The celestials found it interesting for a few reasons. Some of them didn't really seem concerned, while others just wanted to see the outcome, but the majority were like Xox.

They had a hunch that this would turn into something bigger, depending on their next move.

Right now, they were witnessing the Celestial and Godslayer travelling from planet to planet, getting rid of the towers on those planets.

"Why is Athos allowing this to happen? They are destroying everything he has built up, those towers took a long time, and if I remember correctly, it helps him complete his condition." One of the Celestials said.

"You think Athos is scared? Are you just visiting this section or something? If you think that, then you don't know who Athos is." Another replied.

Looking around, a few celestials had just heard of the news about Earth and wanted to see what was going on, so they weren't caught up with those in this part of space. After all, the universe was large, and not everyone knew everyone

"Allow me to explain!" A floating ball said as it flew up high above the white energy where everyone was looking.

"I classify myself as somewhat of a scholar regarding these types of things."

"I'm sure most of you know there are celestials that are born as one due to a belief that they have, and then there are those that are worshipped to the point where they become celestial."

"Athos is somewhat of a mixed situation when it comes to this."

"He wasn't born a celestial, but his father was. So Athos was the child of someone great, and one day, Athos himself killed his father and took over his position."

"The reason why it worked out that his son could become a Celestial after this is unknown, for it was a very long time ago."

"So don't be fooled into thinking that Athos is a weak god. He had strength before getting into his position."

"At the same time, he has done well to continue satisfying his condition and has been growing and expanding."

"Although you have seen the strength of these two, I don't think most of us here have seen Athos making a move."

The celestials were listening to the floating ball intensely, and it did change the opinion of a lot of them. Because some of them had experience and run-ins with Celestials that weren't born, they often had gone through a lot to get into their position, and it sounded the same for Athos.

Another thing was that no one at the scene knew Quinn's history either or what he had been through. They had no clue that Quinn also wasn't a born celestial.

Just then, through the white ball of energy, they could see again that the two of them had destroyed another tower, taking its Nest Crystals to power up Quinn.

"How many towers have they destroyed by now? Although you say all of this, it is clear that Athos isn't doing anything. If he isn't a coward, I am sure there's some reason." A celestial explained.

"Oh? Feel free to act yourself if you wish." A deep voice called out from behind, attracting everyone's attention.

Upon turning around, the Celestials came across one of the largest balls of energy they had ever seen, and this celestial had six arms.

"Athos!" Xox shouted and quickly went down from the sky and closer to the ground floor hiding between the other celestials.

"It's good to see you here. You haven't been here in a while, have you." Athos walked over and could see what the others were looking at.

"I see that there is some type of show going on with my situation," Athos said.

"If you guys are really concerned, feel free to attempt to slow them down. As for why am I doing this, it helps with my condition."

"It's interesting to see how the Amra race reacts to everything that's been happening."

"I want to see how much hope they have in these towers, and what better way to show them a new goal when their god defeats the person who is the cause of all of this."

"When the towers are rebuilt, I will revamp them better than ever, and more people will dream about entering the sacred place. Multiple towers will be able to be built on planets."

"Lately, the Amra people have been dreaming less about entering the towers and enjoying their pleasant lives, and I am not an evil person."

“I will not do what my father did and turn people into slaves so that they dream of a better life. Instead, will I use these two as an enemy and a stepping stone?”

The others didn't say anything. Even the rowdy and confident ones were silent after hearing Athos's words.

For a long time, no one said anything, but they didn't want to leave either, as they wanted to watch what was going on and how Athos would react. It was then that the duo on the Amra Planet didn't take long to take out yet another tower, and now, in total, they had gotten rid of six.

Quinn held the Nest crystal in his hand, and the power was seeping inside him. Seeing the smile on his face, for some reason, had made Athos react a bit.

*** *** ***

Quinn had just finished absorbing yet another crystal, and he had a smile on his face.

"I thought Athos would have arrived a lot earlier by now, but for some reason, he hasn't done anything. Still, six Nest Crystals have given my shadow the kind of boost that it needs."

[135,420 MC points]

"My shadow has regained the limits of what it was in the fight against Graham and perhaps is even stronger."

"I can finally start to try new ways to use it, and if I get more MC points, maybe I will be able to do even better."

Turning around, he saw Sil standing in the strange space, and just like before, the tower started to crumble. It was quite impressive that Sil never seemed to tire and was keeping up with Quinn easily.

Flying out of the tower, they landed on the ground. It was mostly meadow land on this planet, and the distance between the houses and the Tower was quite long.

It was one of their unique planets, and it looked like someone had already instructed the Amra race to clear off the area and get away to a safe distance because other than the guards in the tower, there weren't many or nearly any people around.

They had all left, maybe gone into underground bunkers or left the city to get away from the aftermath of the two's attack on the Tower.

Finally, the two landed on the ground, ready to decide where to proceed next.

"I hope we find the planet soon. Can't you even remember what the planet looked like or something?" Sil asked.

Then, an immense amount of pressure suppressed them both, and turning their heads, they saw a literal giant landing on the surface, and by his side, there were two others as well.

"Who's that giant?" Sil asked.

"Athos... he's finally here." Quinn replied seriously, his smile slowly disappearing.

***

# Chapter 1771: A Celestial spark.

Large meadows covered the current planet they were on, and fields of tall grass were spread across nearly the entire globe. Rivers and streams were few and far between, but there was still plenty of water for life.

Around where the Tower once was, there were a few houses, but they were far between. The houses were built crudely out of wood, as each planet seemed to have a different level of advancement.

For one, they didn't have ships that would allow them to travel to each planet, so they didn't even know that there were other planets with the same race. The good thing was that the guards had cleared the place of people. They have been sent away from the area of the Tower.

Quinn could tell this, and he was relieved of this fact. Not to mention that finally, the one and only Athos had arrived. However, he wasn't alone. Standing by his side were the two females that had a golden shine to their skin.

The Tower had crumbled and turned into nothing but particles that dispersed into the air, and soon it was as if it never even existed.

"I thought we would be back at the tower the next time we met?" Athos asked, folding his arms.

"You have done a lot of unexpected things for a while now. Did you think it would go unheard? Or did you really do all this just to catch my attention?"

Moving one of his arms, he opened it up, and a white portal appeared. Then, quickly popping out of it were three small figures, at least compared to the others. These three were none other than Quinn's accomplices, the three Amra who had climbed the Tower on the first planet with him.

"We're finally out of that place! We're finally out! Finally!" Nock shouted as soon as he landed.

Dober quickly cleared his throat as he used his head to direct the other into what was going on. Turning around, they could see Quinn standing with a stranger that looked similar to him, and around thirty metres apart were Athos and two others.

They were also quite far away from everything and were standing in the middle of a field whose grass reached their knees, around 100 metres away.

"This is our chance! I don't know what happened. but we should run!" Nock suggested.

"Run? Do you think that we were just let out randomly? The person who put us in this situation is standing right there. There is no reason to run." Geo replied to his old friend.

"I continue to prove to you I am not a bad person, I have released these three friends of yours, but if you do not change your mind, they might have to witness your death," Athos spoke with an expressionless face.

"I asked you to get rid of my little problem, and although you didn't get rid of him, you did bring him to me.""

It was a change of pace from the usual people that Quinn would deal with. Now he had one less thing to worry about and one less thing to be used against him if they were to go toe to toe.

"I know we talked before, but I want to talk to you again. The only thing I request is a way to head back to earth, for you to send us there if possible." Quinn asked.

"Yes, I didn't get rid of the Godslayer, at least not how you asked, but I can promise you."

"If you can send us both back to earth or at least close to it, he and I will be out of your hair."

"He will promise to never return to you again or come back to this part of the solar system. The end result is exactly what you want: peace."

Athos looked to be thinking for a bit before he said anything but eventually answered.

"How could you trust a God Slayer's word so easily? How do you know one day he won't turn and go against you or come back here against your promise?"

"I trust him," Quinn answered. "He is a dear friend of mine, and if you trusted me, then you should trust me enough to believe in those I trust as well."

"I'm sorry, but this has gone beyond the point where only I am involved, so I have no alternative," Athos replied.

"I will give you a choice, my fellow celestial. I can send you back, but the God Slayer must stay."

Quinn looked at Sil for only a second before turning and shaking his head.

"I'm sorry, but not a chance."

Sil was strong and had defeated celestials before, maybe he could even defeat Athos, but if Quinn left and Sil was to die, this was something that Quinn would never be able to live with.

"Very well, then we have no choice but to fight!" Then, upon moving all of his six arms, a spear, a short sword, a giant shield, and a mace appeared in his hands.

And in the remaining two, there were bows and arrows, but on a close look, Quinn noticed that there were no arrows and the bowstring that would be pulled was rather thick.

"You guys seem very strong, but you will be no match for us." Athos stated.

"Whoa, this might be a bit tough. There's three of them and like ten arms between those giants." Sil smirked, not phased at all, even though Quinn was a little nervous, but it seemed like there was some strange new confidence in Sil.

*** *** ***

Inside the Celestial space, Athos had told everyone his intentions, and in the end, he had stated that there would most likely be a fight. In fact, he was so confident in his win that he had told the celestials that were watching to spread the word, as they would witness his power.

After leaving, that was exactly what those Celestials did. They had ample time to inform the other Celestials in the space that a battle between two Celestials was about to begin. However, what attracted everyone's attention was the fact that a Godslayer was also involved in this battle.

It was certainly a strange situation, which was why so many were interested in witnessing the fight, and now there were around 1000 different Celestials watching everything that was taking place. In the end, the Celestials who made this space had to enlarge it so everyone could fit in.

It was then that someone who was really curious decided to enter the space. Some strange things were starting to occur, and some had attempted to get in contact with her several times. Finally, she had entered the space, no longer being able to ignore what was happening.

"This place... always makes me feel somewhat glum, which is why I don't wish to enter it too often. Now, let's see what all the commotion was about."

It didn't take long for the Celestial to catch the wind and get to the area that was talked about. She soon could see that the rumours were true. She stared into the white energy deeply as she looked at everyone involved and clenched her hands tightly.

"I have tried so hard to keep things in control... is it just impossible?"

"Earth is where I came from, so I have an attachment to it, but if others find out what is going on, it will be in big trouble."

The celestial was none other than Bliss, one of the strongest Celestials who resided in the Milky Way galaxy. In a way, everything about to happen is my fault. I sent him here, hoping he would understand and learn the dangers of his actions, but it seems somehow he has managed to make things worse and catch the attention of everyone.

"My foresight doesn't really work on other celestials, making it difficult for me to precut anything to do with him, or maybe it's because he is a 'Talen'."

"Either way, if this gets out of hand and the unexpected occurs."

"I may have to speak to him..." Bliss thought.

# Chapter 1772: The most infamous group.

Somewhere in the Milkyway galaxy, a giant ship, shaped like the front part of a handgun, was floating peacefully. It could hold around 6000 people, including a fleet of vessels ready to be used at any time.

It was one of the most advanced, state-of-the-art ships created with the help of Logan Green. However, not once had Logan Green ever stepped foot on this ship because it did not belong to him. Instead, it belonged to the infamous group, the Blade family.

The enormous ship was designed in a similar style to the Bertha ships back in the day. After all, it was what the Cursed family had used a long time ago, and when the Blades had decided to split away from the Cursed group, nearly all members had been part of the Cursed faction.

The Blade children saved from the island and raised on the Cursed faction ship had made it resemble the place as much as they could. Only now, it had a modern touch, and there were a few more additional facility areas than before.

At the moment, there were around 2000 people on board the Blade ship. It was nowhere near max capacity, but not all those on the Blade ship were members of the Blade family or had the Blade ability.

For one, many of the kids went on to have families and brought their families on board the ship. Some wished to follow in the previous generation Blades's footsteps and learn the ability, but some just wanted to live a simple life.

Then, there was the orphanage based on the ship. Due to the original Blade kids feeling a bit like Orphans, not growing up with birth parents to look after them, they decided to open up a facility.

At times, the Blades would help out certain planets if there were tricky situations. For instance, even if a strong beast attacked a shelter, the Blades would send out a group of people to help them.

However, with fighting wars, there were always those left without any guardian, which was why they created the facility in the first place. There was everything on board the ship.

Shops, a canteen, a cinema, a school and so on. The ship was designed such that the Blades never have to leave the place, and of course, they could leave as they wished. If their role were significant on the crew, there would be rotations and such, but everything worked like clockwork and worked well.

One huge addition to the ship was the prison on the bottom of the ship. It worked like most prisons, but its main purpose for being built was to capture the Chained that didn't deserve to be called human.

It was the Blades' mission to capture these people and ensure they didn't ruin the lives of others. If there were any children or they were young and had been taught by the Chained, they would attempt to raise them at the orphanage and send them to school.

No one believed that one should be punished for who their parents were, and the Blades knew that best.

Currently, the Blades were having a meeting inside one of the meeting rooms on board the ship. The head of each facility and department on board the ship were gathered here. These were not the strongest fighters but were the most respected among those on the vessel.

There was the head of education, head of medical facilities and more, and standing at the front of them all was a rare dark-haired person who was treated just like any other Blades due to being with them since the beginning. This person was Shiro.

He let out a big sigh as he looked at one of the seats that were currently empty. A digital plaque in front of it stated this seat belonged to the head of squad two, one of the three attack forces that the Blades used.

It was not the only empty seat, as squad one, right next to Shiro, was also vacant.

"I guess we just have to start the meeting without them." Shiro sighed, wishing at least for this one they would turn up because this meeting would be pretty significant.

"Let me first update you on the projects we have been working on so far…"

Shiro went on to first talk about everything going on on the ship. Then, he congratulated a few of them on their achievements, but there were nervous looks on everyone's faces because they knew that Shiro always did this when there was something concerning. He would praise everyone even for a minor thing before dropping a giant bomb on top of their heads.

"And now, unfortunately, we have to get to the unpleasant parts," Shiro began as everyone in the room baited their breath.

"As you all know, we have received a distress message from none other than Logan Green himself."

"Although he has asked us for help in the past on small things here and there, never has he asked for us to contact Sil."

An image of the current Sil appeared on Screen. Everyone in the room knew of Sil. In fact, there wouldn't be a person on the ship that didn't know of Sil because of his achievements in the past and what he was doing was taught to them all.

However, nearly no one in the room had ever seen him, to the point where some even thought he was a myth, a fake who didn't even exist but was talked about to keep them inspired. After all, over the last thousand years, plenty of newborns had his powers, but not a single one was able to produce a soul weapon like his that made up for the Blade family's weakness. He was indeed one of a kind person.

"Unfortunately, we have not received a reply from Sil, nor has any of our monitoring equipment been able to sense him coming back this way."

"I was sitting on this one for a while, hoping for Sil to arrive by now, but he hasn't."

"But one thing is clear: Logan Green needs our help more than ever, and if he asked for Sil, it would be at the level where the whole of humanity's existence is at stake."

At first, some department heads in the room didn't believe what Shiro was saying. In their eyes, the world, even Earth, was now more peaceful than ever.

There were only battles between a few larger forces, but these skirmishes never involved the general populace. Of course, there were cases where Red Vampires had attacked normal humans, but by now, that was just something everyone needed to live.

It was only recently that crazy events started to occur. Once they saw that Shiro wasn't laughing, those who chuckled and smiled quickly shut up. Even if they were at this ship's top of the hierarchy, they wouldn't dare to relax in front of Shiro.

"I left this information to the end for a reason." Sill stated. "Squad One isn't here because there have been sightings of Russ."

"I know we believed that we had already dealt with him, but it turns out he's alive and kicking. As I say this, Squad One is gathering information on him and trying to find his whereabouts."

"He holds a large grudge against us, so he is a big threat as well, which is why I have decided to go help Logan Green in person. If Sil can't go, then at least I must get there on time."

Immediately, everyone looked at each other and started to whisper. Shiro was strong and was perhaps one of the strongest Blades they had. However, he was not at the level of Jake Green, whom they didn't consider a Blade.

If Sil was as great as Shiro made him out to be, they were sending someone who was perhaps 1/1000 of the power that they needed to overcome the problem.

"I'll be honest, but don't you think you should just stay out of it? The Blades have made a good life for themselves, and we will be able to protect ourselves better. We're stronger together." One of the heads of the department said.

"I don't want to offend, but there is a good chance that sending you out there won't make a difference. So in the end, is it even worth it?"

"You make a good point, but don't forget that I won't be alone. There is a reason why I have been able to survive tough battles until now, but you are right..."

"I believe the Green need more power, so I wanted to discuss who we could send out with me while maintaining everything going here."

The room was silent. There appeared to be next to no volunteers, but that was when they heard the door slide open. A rugged voice boomed through the whole, overwhelming the silence instantly.

"I heard everything, and I will be going with you. That should be enough, right?"

A man stepped inside the whole and soon sat on Squad Two Leader's seat, nearly breaking it from the pressure and making it squeak. The others glanced at him but soon looked away, hoping to avoid eye contact.

The only person unaffected by his presence was Shiro himself. With a smile, he replied.

"Of course, you are welcome, Borden."

# Chapter 1773: Sides.

After the incidents in Green City, many people felt anxious about the safety measures. The whole mood was as if Logan Green had let them down.

In the beginning, many people didn't know about the attackers and didn't believe the words of the witnesses when the latter said it was the Red Vampires who had infiltrated and were the main reason behind the chaos.

The main reason behind this, besides their trust in Green City, was that the death toll was only two. Considering it was an attack from one of the most powerful factions, the Red Vampires, this number was too low.

However, there were news outlets and sources from Earth that supported Pure and had spun this story as much as they could and even spiced it up to show Green City as a weakened hollow shell and the vampires as the scourge of humanity.

"Look, there is one thing you can't change, and it's the fact that the vampires attacked Logan Green."

"He works closely with the Vampire Corps because he believes in the vampires more than his own race, and now look what happened."

"The Vampires were the ones who attacked, rather than Pure!" One person had commented online.

"Just because there are a few bad apples doesn't mean the whole tree is poisonous. The Vampire Corps even saved my Uncle's life, and they have fought against the Red Vampires just as hard as any other group."

"But, unfortunately, this latter group happens to be vampires as well, and if they were a group of humans doing this, then you would just say they are a bunch of terrorists!"

"To the one above, that's my point. These vampires feast on our blood and eventually take over us. It's in their nature."

"The whole Vampire Corps thing is fake as well. Just a facade to confuse us, and I bet they're even working with the Red Vampires."

The human race was mainly split among three solar systems. Earth's solar system had the most influential humans, and they were more directly involved in the political struggle between Pure and Logan Green.

The Beast solar system was full of individual-run factions with powerful Travellers, such as the Bree family. Meanwhile, the third solar system, where the vampires originally lived, was now inhabited by the Graylash family, who had agreed to stay neutral so everyone there could live peaceful lives.

Although humans lived across these three different solar systems and elected their leaders differently, Earth was similar to the old ways. There would be an official election and votes from all the planets in Earth's solar system to declare which party should rule.

The current leader was Logan Green. A member of the now-forgotten Cursed faction that had saved the world, Creator of several inventions that made the lives of everyone more effortless, and he seemed like a genuine person who cared for people as well.

Still, due to the fear of an attack, either by demon tier beasts, the Dalki, or the Red Vampires, strength was an important factor when choosing who to lead them.

Logan had the Vampire Corps on his side supporting him. While the Pure had the Dhampirs, Although they were never officially recognised as a group, people knew they were working together. With the Red Vampires currently being the main threat people were starting to favour the presence of the dhampirs.

It was also why all of these groups had attended the Chained Faction Leader's wedding, hoping to gain the favour of another influential faction and get more people on their side. After all, people had to be careful when choosing where to live and who to vote for.

Because of the history and the tension between the people who claimed to be part of one group or another, there was always a chance of a quarrel breaking out. If that did happen, they would also need to choose a side even if they aren't part of the whole conflict.

With all of this, for the first time since Logan had decided to run for the elections, the polls indicated it was highly likely that Pure would come into power.

In the Green tower, Logan was cool-headed even after learning this news. But, truth be told, it did somewhat disappoint him, not in the results but the reaction from the general populace. Logan had stayed on this planet for the people. He had decided to help them because that was what Quinn would have wanted.

But now, many saw him as the villain because he was suppressing the Dhampirs and Pure from attacking the vampires. Nonetheless, he needed to focus on the task in front of him.

"Remember, the main objective, for now, is to save Vincent, not to take out the Red Vampires," Logan said.

"While there, it would be best if we could figure out their system, how they work, their numbers and any important information."

"All this information will allow us to hit the Red Vampires and get rid of them once and for all. Then the third objective would be to obtain the Red Heart, if possible."

This message soon reached Peter, Muka, Mitchell, Minny, Linda, Jessica, Hannah, and Jake Green. But, in truth, Logan wanted to send his best people along with them to get rid of the Red Vampires after what they had done.

However, after reassessing the video, he knew that no one on their side currently had the strength to take on Laxmus, Jake Green could probably go toe to toe with him, but to win a fight was another thing altogether. On top of that, he wouldn't be going himself because he feared the city could suffer another attack.

Whether it be Pure or extremist, he didn't know, but he had to stay at least and protect in case anyone tried to take advantage of the ongoing unrest.

"Jake will be carrying a portable teleporter. Although I was the one who had banned these, this is an emergency situation."

"If the situation gets dire, use the portable teleported to contact me, and I will come with reinforcements."

"Apart from Jake, who will be in disguise, no one knows about this mission since you aren't directly associated with any factions."

"However, you are a part of Quinn's group, which is why you are the best people to do this."

"I don't want to force any of you into this, but with the Red Heart in Laxmus's hands, all of humanity's lives are at stake."

"And a group mainly of non-humans are trying to save it." Peter couldn't help but comment.

"Help is on the way" Logan smiled at the comment Peter had made. "They will meet you at the meeting point I have shared with Jake. I wish you all luck, and if I hear anything about Quinn, I promise to inform you as soon as possible."

*** *** ***

At an unknown location on Earth, a large group of around three hundred were sprinting through a rocky mountain area at an incredible speed. They would either jump sideways or hop over difficult terrain while running straight ahead.

In the front of the group was one covered head to toe in a rose gold armour. In addition, she adorned a pointed helmet inclined backwards with a red feather on its side. This helmet covered most of her head and face, only leaving enough space for her eyes and cherry red lips.

Out the back of the helmet, one could see her waving blonde hair. Not looking back or slowing down, she continued to run ahead of the rest of the group because she was confident that whoever she faced, she could deal with them with no problem at all.

Then, the ends of her hair started to change in colour slightly, turning slightly black.

"It looks like we are close."

*** *** ***

"The dhampirs will be at the Red Base any second now." Agent four said, pushing his glasses back onto his nose.

"Yes... this is interesting to see what will happen. Because I'm sure both parties will be surprised, after all, I doubt "he" will do anything if his most faithful and hardworking servant is in trouble."

"For now... bwe take the sidelines and do nothing as we watch this whole affair unfold, but we might need to act soon if things go... unexpected." Zero smiled.

"I hope the Red Vampires are successful... and then we can move onto the next step." Zero thought.

# Chapter 1774: The Red Split!

Xander was nervously pacing back and forth. It hadn't been long since Layla had left, and Vincent was in his shadow space, but then again, it wasn't really his shadow space. Anyone who had access to the crystal he was using would also be able to use the shadow space, as long as they knew how to operate it, and quite a few people in the Red Vampires knew how to handle it.

"Will Layla have trouble? Should I have gone with her?" Xander thought.

"I know she's strong and shouldn't have any problems getting into the facility."

"Of course, no one would stop her from walking in there, but I feel like once the nest crystal is gone, everyone will notice it, right? How will she escape after that?"

Several thoughts went back and forth through Xander's head since too much time seemed to have passed for such a simple task. So now he was debating whether to leave or not.

Having made his decision, Xander walked towards the exit of the cave, and as he was about to push it open, he could hear the mechanism going off and part of the wall starting to move. Then, when Xander saw the two small horns he had come to adore, he could finally breathe a massive sigh of relief.

"What took so long? Don't tell me there's a bunch of people behind you or something?" Xander asked, peeking his head out to look behind Layla and sighed in relief upon noticing there was no one else.

From underneath the black robe that she was wearing, she pulled out a crystal that looked like it had space directly inside it. This was the space crystal. It was clear that it was a type of nest crystal, and with only one in the whole settlement, Xander realised that what they had been planning for so long had become a reality.

"I needed to talk to them... we have to make them aware of everything going on. We brought them along into this mess. Anyway, bring Vincent out now. Let's see what we can do." Layla said.

Xander did as was told, and in the next instant, a shadow emerged out of Xander's crystal, leaving Vincent as it slowly dispersed. At the same time, the crystal became slightly lighter in colour.

Layla kneeled beside Vincent's body and placed the space crystal on the latter's body around the wound. The crystal stayed in place, but nothing was happening. There was no reaction from the crystal, nor was there a reaction from Vincent.

She closed her eyes and used her ability, enveloping her hand in green flames. This time she placed the crystal and her hand onto the wound, hoping for something to happen. Still, there was no effect. Again, she tried to gather her Qi to drain the energy out of the Nest crystal, but nothing seemed to be working.

"Don't tell me... you jumped the gun and just got the Nest crystal hoping something would happen?!" Xander asked, already slapping his hand on his forehead.

"Look, I thought he had a nest crystal before, and we have one now that it would just do its own thing or something!" Layla replied.

"I panicked. I know we need to save him and what will save him, but I just don't know how this thing works and thought we could figure it out."

Seeing how Layla was panicking, Xander felt like he should have noticed it before, but Layla wasn't acting entirely like herself. And it was clear it wasn't because of Vincent or LAxmus, but the most likely reason was to the face of the person she was trying to save.

"There were a lot of sleepless nights for her back then..."

"Then, how about we go back to the laboratory? But this time, we will go back together," Xander said.

"There should be someone that knows how the crystal works in that lab if they use its energy on the clones, but we have to act now before Laxmus finds out. He hasn't found out already, has he?" He asked as a worrying expression appeared on his face.

Layla shook her head and was already leaving the room, with Xander tailing not far behind her.

"So what exactly did you say to June and Kev?" Xander asked.

"They know what our goal has been since day one. They have managed to enjoy their life here for a long time already."

"You and I should have also left this world a long time ago. Whatever happens to them or us, they will understand." Layla replied.

Not sure whether he liked the answer or not, Xander said nothing because he knew this day would come. He just never thought it would be so soon. Both Xander and Layla were no longer in disguise as they walked through the settlement.

It was easier for them to travel with their Guardian ranks and Red Vampire Leader respectively, especially to the lab they were heading to, and they could see the lab where Layla had been not so long ago.

"So, what will we do if no one knows how this thing works?" Xander asked.

"Well, then I guess we just need to leave this place."

"Of course, Laxmus will chase us, and we might not even make it far, but maybe we can meet someone who can help, or maybe the Dhampirs will end up attacking this place before we get caught."

Layla and Xander only needed to show their appearance to get into the lab, and the guards didn't ask any questions as to why Layla had returned after leaving so soon. They noticed everything in the laboratory seemed to be working as they walked through the facility and its metallic hallways.

"I'm a bit worried," Xander whispered. "Even though you stole the crystal only ten minutes ago, everyone inside here is acting so... normal. Don't they have a mechanism that tells them when the nest crystal is in use and when it stops?"

"Or wouldn't they notice that a large energy source suddenly disappeared? So why isn't there an alarm? And why did they just let us in as if nothing happened and everything was normal."

Although Xander was thinking with his head, Layla was quickly pacing through to where she had stolen the crystal, hoping to find someone or a few people they could ask questions to. Finally, they had reached the main door, which someone had already opened.

It was a large, heavy metal door that required access to open from the staff. Walking into the place, they could see the several giant containers of blood, and finally, they had reached the main lab where the staff would be looking after and operating the Nest crystal.

"Damn it." Upon entering the lab, Xander couldn't help but curse because the last person they wanted to see in the world right now - Laxmus - was standing there with his hands behind his back.

Based on a staff member's body lying ripped apart on the floor and the blood spilt all over the floor, they knew Laxmus was already aware of the situation.

"This is to see," Laxmus said, looking at the two, being already aware of their presence.

"I just received news that someone has stolen the Next Crystal, and now my whole mood is ruined. Also, I have yet to alert the entire base to let the thief think they're safe."

"But you see, these workers here told me that a woman had entered here not too long ago, and it seemed like the crystal went missing around the same time that woman entered."

"So this makes me wonder why the female in question returned to this place. Was it a coincidence?" Laxmus asked as he walked toward the two of them.

Seeing this, Xander took deep breaths in and out due to fear and panic.

"Calm down, we can get out of this situation. He has no proof right now and is just bluffing. We can get out of this if we say the right thing."

From the corner of his eve, he glanced toward Layla and could see she had already pulled out her black sword and was holding it in her hands, while her horns now appeared to be made of lava. She was ready for a fight.

"I forgot, with her here, it's impossible to talk it out." Xander thought.

***

# Chapter 1775: The same power.

Although Xander believed they could get out of this situation by talking, Layla didn't think the same. After all, she had worked closest to Laxmus for a while and knew she was already a prime suspect, not to mention that Laxmus was the type of person to act first.

Seeing the dead research worker in the lab was enough proof of that. Either way, they would have to fight until Layla could prove she didn't take the Nest crystal, which was impossible because she had done.

So she took out the strange black short sword, and its marking began to pulse. It seemed synced with the horns on her head, as they would pulsate in red, on and off. For a second, Layla gritted her teeth and squinted hard but quickly opened her eyes and regained her composure, balancing herself.

"Oh, what is this!" A voice resounded in Layla's head, almost as if someone was shouting in her ear.

At the same time, she also heard heart-wrenching screams of people. Concentrating, she focused hard to suppress the other sounds so she could listen to the sword talking to her.

"We just went through a tough fight not too long ago where you needed to use me, and now you need to use me again. I mean, you should try and fight for yourself for…" The sword stopped when it noticed the opponent in front of it.

"Please tell me it's not true." The sword said. "Tell me you aren't going up against him? Aren't you two on the same side?"

“Never have been. I need you to help me, really help me this time."

"I am determined and promise that everything will not be the same as last time. I know the two of you get your power from the same source, so I want to know if there will be any trouble between you?" Layla asked.

At the same time, Laxmus was thinking along similar lines.

"I see... so you won't step in, will you? So you still allow her to use her power, and you still allow me to use mine?"

"Is this your way of us proving to you which one is more worthy?" Laxmus asked, but there was no reply.

Which usually, Laxmus took as a yes.

"Very well, I don't know why you are doing this, but it seems you wish to disturb what I have created!"

Laxmus didn't hold back as his body immediately started to transform, and unlike when he entered the arena, his whole body was changing this time.

His entire body was growing with muscle making him almost twice the size he was. His skin turned from pale to an almost pure black while white lines of energy pulsated where his veins would be visible.

His ears became as large as an elephant but were pointed sharp like bats. His mouth also became bigger, revealing an enormous set of sharp fangs. Next were his eyes, which were now completely red, and there was no white in them, and finally, a set of wings extended out of his back, looking exactly like that of bats.

It was a horrifying image, similar to what Laxmus looked like when he last transformed. Then, the radiating energy around him made him look like someone who didn't belong to this world, not the vampires, humans or any other known species.

When the transformation was complete, a wave of energy escaped from Laxmus's body, causing the nearby vampires in the room's to get thrown back.

"Get behind me!" Layla ordered Xander.

Lifting her sword, she spun it, and a purple fog came out. When the energy reached them, it swooped around the two of them and continued.

"I'm going to advise you again. Will you reconsider this fight? I will help you as you have been feeding me well, and you seem to be one of the most mentally strongest people who has ever owned me."

"But even I'm not sure if we can win together." The sword claimed.

The wave of energy they had just felt wasn't from an attack or anything like that. It was simply from Laxmus's transformation and using all the celestial energy he had at his disposal. Reaching behind her, Layla had pulled out the nest crystal and threw it straight behind her to Xander.

"Take it, and run away. Find someone who can use it, maybe even go to Logan Green, but get away from here, and don't come back until you have some way of stopping this guy!" Layla order.

Hearing those words, Xander was angry because Layla had already somewhat given up. She was simply saying she couldn't beat him and could only buy some time.

"When... when did it turn out like this? You protecting me instead of me protecting you." Xander thought while running out of the lab. He wouldn't let Layla's sacrifice be in vain. He knew it wouldn't matter if he stayed back because if she couldn't deal with Laxmus, he wouldn't be the latter's match either. This was why he decided through his head instead of his heart.

Exiting the entire building, Xander could see several vampires and squad leaders heading toward the lab. It made him grit his teeth harder as he saw what mess Layla would have to try and get out of.

However, they weren't the main concern. Jumping up, Xander landed on one of the building's rooftops and started to run across the town, avoiding as many people as possible.

"I shouldn't worry too much. Not everyone in the Red Vampires is aligned with Laxmus. There will definitely be someone willing to help Layla as well. Maybe I can do something."

As Xander thought this, his worst fears came to light, as he could see a figure with a hood in front of him in the distance. Then, looking to his left, right, and behind him, he found himself surrounded by three more, a total of four and all wearing hoods covering their face.

"Xander, we will give you a chance as another fellow guardian. Please give yourself in, and don't let this turn ugly." One of the Guardians called out in a male voice.

"You guys know nothing!" Xander shouted back. "Don't you know what type of person Laxmus is? Didn't some of you used to follow Quinn?"

"He would have never used the red crystal to turn everyone into vampires, and that might not even be Laxmus's end goal in the first place. How can you trust someone like him?!"

Xander's whole body had turned into a mist, but it was impossible to cover the vast area that all Guardians were covering. They were standing too far apart. Still, out of the mist, red aura lines came out, like a single blade towards the others.

Some of the guardians avoided this, while one or two of them had used their shadow to stop the attack, with one physically grabbing the red aura and throwing it out to the side, hitting one of the buildings.

"This is going to be a tough fight with four of them. I can't use my shadow because I'm low on it, and Vincent is inside the space."

"The only good thing is that while he's in there, his wound and state don't downgrade because of the slow flow of time."

"Still, fighting against one of them would be hard enough, never mind four, and they know my mist ability well, having fought side by side for years."

When Xander thought things couldn't get worse, it looked like another nodded vampire had arrived in a black robe. So there were now five guardians that he had to face.

"Oh right, and the longer this fight goes on, the more guardians and maybe even more people will get involved."

"Don't any of you care about Layla?!" Xander shouted, hoping to convince some of them.

"She is a leader of the Red Vampires as well. Surely some of you follow her more and not Laxmus. The two are in a stalemate at the moment."

Trying to convince one of the guardians to switch was the only thing Xander could think of, even though he knew it was unlikely. The Guardians always respected Laxmus more, unlike the regular Red Vampires, because he was the one that had given them their shadow powers.

The five kept their distance. Then, simultaneously they raised hands and started swinging away, producing multiple red slashes of aura towards the mist. There were so many attacks that at least one was bound to hit Xander, and he also knew this.

Trying to survive, he remained in the fog, releasing his own bloody aura, striking and breaking them when the two forces collided, but it seems that he'll soon be finished, as he will not be able to stop all of them.

Just then, leaping from the ground, two figures entered the mist, and suddenly, more aura appeared out of it. And it turned out that the new auras were just as powerful as the Guardians attacks. So at that moment, all the Guardians decided to stop their attacks to see what was happening.

The mist from Xander slowly dissipated. Now, standing by his side were a man and a woman. The man had show hair, while the woman had dark brown hair that went up to her shoulders and a hair band holding it.

"We will help you." The female said.

"June... Kev... what are you…" Xander was speechless.

"You have always told us that you're training us for this very day. So here we are. Don't worry, Dad." The male vampire replied.

***

# Chapter 1776: Celestial Black Sword.

Not all of the Guardians had gone after Xander. There wasn't a direct order from any leaders for them to do this. The guardians acted on their own accord, but they knew of the situation due to a specific power that allowed them to communicate together. With each bit of new information received, they were able to tell the others what was happening, where they were and more.

Some Guardians decided to go after the one who had stolen the crystal, while a few had gathered around the lab where it all began. They didn't need to go inside to understand what was happening, as they could feel the energy shockwaves halfway in the settlement.

Due to this, some of the guardians unanimously decided to stay outside and control the commotion going on. But many Red Vampires wanted to enter the lab to know what was happening. After all, nearly all of the red vampires were combat oriented, they were different compared to the last vampire settlement.

If they didn't want to take up arms, they could have chosen a more peaceful life in other areas. But instead, these vampires had joined this faction with a goal, mainly due to the leaders.

"Let us in! We have a right to know what is happening!" A vampire shouted.

"Is our leader okay? There is so much energy inside."

"Most likely, both of our leaders are fighting. It's the only time I have felt so much energy in one place. Something must have seriously gone wrong."

"It's that damned Laxmus! He is always a hot-headed one. We have to enter!"

The Red Vampires were split into opinions and had all gathered in one place. Before, the only thing stopping the two sides from fighting was the two leaders working together. But now, if they weren't, it could easily cause the whole group to collapse.

Still, the guardians could hold nearly all of them back with their shadow alone. Some vampires were already trying to rush in but were pushed back with great force. It had clearly shown them the gap in strength between them was huge, but it was unknown how long the guardians could push them back as more and more people started to gather.

"What is going on inside? It's no doubt that Laxmus and Layla are fighting, and Xander is working with her as well?" Ashley thought.

"I thought you were like me, that you hated the humans for what they had done, and you wanted to either get rid of them or turn them, but have you just been a double agent this whole time."

Ashley had an internal struggle because he remembered his times with Paul before and after he turned into a vampire. They had gone through scuffles and battles before, and truthfully there were many times when he had seen humans do just as cruel things to each other over their beliefs.

It made him think for a second that even if there weren't vampires, humans would have found something else to fight over each other. In fact, before they knew the existence of vampires, many higher ability users had treated the lower ones like scum. The current state of things felt similar.

Ashley shook his head.

"No… it doesn't change anything… Paul is dead, and so is my family…this is the right path."

*** *** ***

Inside the lab, Laxmus had finished his transformation, while Layla's body had stayed mostly the same, even though she was using the sword and her power. She had mastered the True Hanyma form, which combined all three of her forms into one, and now she was permanently in this stage.

Over the years, there had been minor changes, such as her horns getting a little bigger, their colour changing depending on what emotion Layla was feeling, among other things, but she now had only one form and was ready to fight at any time.

Immediately, Laxmus threw out his hand, and a large portal opened just above his shoulder. Out came a gigantic black shadow that imitated his hand movements. It was as if a giant had thrown a punch, only this was almost unavoidable and could block most ofthe attacks.

"We have been planning to go against you for a long time, Laxmus!" Layla shouted as she held the black sword in her hand. Her hands had begun to turn red as if they were on fire, and soon a strange yellow glow covered the entire sword, making it look a lot bigger.

As the shadow hand reached the tip of her sword, she slashed it forward, and it managed to stab right through the shadow, forcing it to disperse. However, Layla didn't stop there as she knew she couldn't afford to. So she began to slash repeatedly, as fast as possible, cutting the giant hand of shadows. Her single blade almost looked like it had turned to three as the yellow Aura had split and there was an after image of power in her attacks. Then, the shadow eventually disappeared, and Laxmus could only see an unharmed Layla.

"I see. You have been practising against that Guardian of yours to understand how my shadow works. That's interesting, but let's see how you deal with this!"

Laxmus's mouth opened wide, and a red energy ball formed right outside of it. It was the size of a basketball but soon started to condense, and red particles gathered around it.

Seeing this, Layla started to desperately spin her sword in a clockwise direction. Her hands were changing colours by the second, covered in all sorts offlames. Then, opening her mouth, she breathed fire onto the sword. It wasn't a small fire by any means, as the windmill of fire was getting larger and larger, and within seconds, it was almost touching the ceiling of the large lab.

"I'm going to need to draw more of your power… he's using that strange energy again that you talked about." Layla said.

"It's celestial energy, and I can give you some, but you have to remember your body, although strong, isn't strong enough to handle it like others."

"You don't have a marking or any celestial energy of your own either. You've only borrowed it from me from time to time." The sword explained.

"I know, but if I don't borrow it now, I'm dead, so what choice do I have?!"

Just then, Laxmus shot out the red beam of energy in his mouth, and it went straight for the large wheel of flame that Layla had created by spinning the sword with her hands.

But something strange happened before the red beam could touch the flame. Layla's view began to turn almost black. And while she was unaware of what was happening, the colour of her veins also began to change.

At the same time, the screams and cries of countless people began to get louder in her head, and it almost felt like she could directly hear them.

"Power these feelings, convert these negative thoughts into your own power!" Layla gave her all.

The beam was pushing Layla back. But she started to spin the sword faster, and more energy began forming, countering Laxmus's powerful blood aura. And in the end, the red aura began to dwindle, and after some time, the red beam attack finally ended. Layla was standing fine, having survived the powerful attack.

"I knew you were special. Otherwise, Immortui would have never let you keep that sword."

"That sword has passed through too many hands trying to find someone suitable for it, and it looks like you were the right person." Laxmus said.

"However, I just see this as another test, another way to prove myself that I am deserving of a position by Immortui's side, and not just as a simple follower!"

"The universe will have to answer to me. Otherwise, I will make it crumble!" Laxmus flapped his wings as he slowly began to fly in the air.

The shadow gathered around his back, creating a larger copy of himself. His fingernails grew longer and sharper in length, and the white light in his body shined brighter.

Meanwhile, Layla swung her sword keeping it by her side and stared at Laxus. The black veins had gone up to her forehead and were continuously growing. When she opened her eyes, one of them had already turned pitch black.

"I have waited for him for so long… for so long… I CAN'T DIE NOW!"

***

# Chapter 1777: Chaos!

By now, nearly everyone in the vampire settlement had some idea of what was going on, and this was why most of them had gathered outside the large Lab where the Guardians were trying to keep things under control.

They had used their shadow a few times to either make sure to settle the rowdy ones or push back the confused and angry crowd from the Lab. But, as the numbers increased, the Guardians also had difficulty controlling the crowd.

It was clear that tensions were rising as the people were getting no answers, and these vampires wanted to know what was happening.

"You damned traitors!" A vampire shouted. "We should have first discussed everything."

"I bet Laxmus found the red heart and has already decided what to do with it. This isn't what Quinn would have wanted!"

"He's right!" A female shouted, and soon a chant started among the crowd in Quinn's name.

"Quinn! Quinn! Quinn!" The crown was getting louder. After all, most of them had joined with their belief Quinn, the last official king of the vampire settlement, wanted to protect the vampires at all costs.

"I just received some information, and according to it, Laxmus attacked Green City, and it looks like he retrieved the red heart after all. So it must be the reason the two are fighting!"

Eventually, news of what Laxmus had done would spread because there were too many witnesses. No matter how tightly sealed Logan tried to keep the information, it would eventually get out, and for the Red Vampires, who were already being ostracised by the whole world, this was terrible news.

And when they heard the vampire's words, the other vampires in front couldn't take it anymore, and a group of three started attacking. Not only were they running towards the lab, their eyes were red, as was the aura within them that had begun to activate.

It was the first time, rather than pushing forward, they had decided to attack, and seeing this, it didn't look like they were the only ones planning to charge in either. They were heading straight towards one of the guardians, and by now, the latter would have used his shadow to push them back or grab them in the air, but he had done neither.

Ashley, who was around five metres away, was observing the situation. He had his own group of vampires to worry about, but the side to the right of him was undoubtedly more rowdy and active than his side.

That's when he noticed a slight movement by the Guardian.

"Don't tell me, he's..." before Ashley could do anything, the other Guardian raised his hands and threw a small dagger at the incoming vampires. It instantly pierced right through the head of the vampire, and he immediately collapsed.

The Guardian then showed his hands, revealing that he had several more daggers ready to throw at any moment. The other two stopped in their tracks, and sweat trickled down their faces. They were too nervous about making another move in case another attack came their way.

Both of them were well aware of the gap between the Guardian and their strength, and now that they had cooled down, they finally understood how big of a mistake it was to go against the former. In fact, they were only eareless because they weren't expecting him to kill them.

"What are you doing?!" Ashley couldn't take it any more as he walked away from his position. "You could have just used your shadow to push them back. You didn't have to kill him!"

The Guardian looked at the other vampire crowd, which had slowly turned silent, and no one seemed ready to charge forward.

"I believe the result of my actions shows for itself." The Guardian replied. "They are no longer as rowdy as before."

"They're just worried," Ashley growled. His fists were clenched and shaking due to the sheer anger and frustration he was feeling at this moment.

"They joined our group thinking that we would change things, and they just want to know what is happening, and now... you just killed someone, one of our own, just like that?"

The Guardian smiled back.

"I am a guardian, and he was just a simple Red Vampire. They need to listen to us. I see that I have done nothing wrong" Ashley frowned at the Guardian, walked up to the dead vampire, and lifted his corpse carefully.

"This vampire, does anyone know him?" He asked the crowd.

Then, a female vampire in the group, who had tears running down her face, raised her trembling hand. She looked like a young adult, maybe in her twenties, but it was hard to tell with vampires in the first place.

"He's... he's my father." The vampire said, her voice choked at the end.

Holding the corpse in his two hands, Ashley walked over to her and carefully handed the body to the young vampire. Then, turning around, Ashley bared his fangs at the smirking Guardian.

"A life is a life! I was told there wouldn't be discrimination based on ranks in this group! You... are just as bad as the ones who killed my family!"

Bearing one's fangs at other vampires was a severe threat, and knowing this, the Guardian retaliated immediately. He instantly threw daggers toward Ashley. Just then, a shadow wall rose, stopping them in place, but then breaking through. Ashley ran towards the other Guardian with his blood aura hardened making a deadly claw-like hand.

"What are you doing? He's trying to attack a fellow Guardian, stop him!" The Guardian shouted, expecting the others to come rushing to his side. But, to his surprise, the red vampires reacted first as they gained some courage and now charged in toward the other Guardians.

At the same time, not everyone in the red vampire group agreed with this, and the conflict began. This incident had truly set off the infighting between the Red Vampires.

Blood aura, weapons clashing, and screams of pain resounded throughout the settlement as the fight between Ashley, and the other guardians had also begun.

"Look what you have caused!" The Guardian said, using his dagger to smash Ashley's claw hand away. His attacks were relentless, but the two seemed evenly matched in power.

"Sometimes small sacrifices must be made for the future." Ashley replied. "You know, I almost forgot after all this time that Laxmus was the one who killed Paul!"

*** *** ***

Not far from the commotion, the family of three, Kev, June and Xander, were faring well. At least well enough to defend themselves. Both June and Kev were no joke when it came to vampires. Their aura could easily be considered at the same level as the Guardians.

However, the guardians had an advantage in their shadow and, at the moment, their numbers. So it was safe to say that the three were mostly on the defensive against the latter.

Just then, three guardians had charged in to attack, while two held back and used their skills such as blood bullets and blood slashes to support their fellow teammates.

Despite all of this, they could not hurt the three due to Xander's mist ability and ability he had learned a long time ago, the one that had belonged to the tenth leader's night. Also, shrouding his two children and himself in the Mist made it hard for them to locate.

While fighting in the Mist, they could attack from different angles, making it appear like they were in certain places they weren't. The three guardians in the Mist were confused as they suddenly saw a large kick coming from their right.

One of them raised a shadow to block the attack, and another Guardian went to repay the kick with the fist. But his punch hit nothing but smoke. It dispersed, faintly revealing an image of a coat one of the three was wearing, but the Mist soon returned.

"I can't believe I have to admit it, but I'm still alive right now because of Kev and June."

"I know we trained them for this day and did everything we could to help them survive if something like this ever happened, but they have surpassed my expectations."

"The only thing is, what do we do? We can't hurt them, but they can't hurt us, and if it's a matter of time..."

Just then, the guardians on the outside attempted to do something. Rather than carefully aiming their attacks to support their teammates, they started to attack the Mist where the others weren't present.

"Your ability is annoying, but it looks like you can't use your shadow for some reason either."

"We will eventually get to you if we eliminate this Mist by making you use more MC cells." One of the Guardians smirked while saying this, and Xander knew he was right.

Can we win? Can we win with the three of us against five of them?

Just when he thought of this, everyone suddenly heard a loud bang. It was deep and low and sounded like it had come from above.

Turning around for a second, they saw that The explosion destroyed the outer region of the underground case, and the minor quake from this created a large hole nearly up to half the height of the ceiling.

"Someone has broken in... Is it the Dhampirs?" Xander thought, only to see a large group of people enter the base.

***

# Chapter 1778: Clash of the Red Leaders.

The screams constantly buzzed in Layla's mind when she used the power of the Celestial Black Sword. She didn't know what and whose screams they were, nor if everyone who used the sword experienced the same thing, or was it because she was a Hannya and was more in tune with others' emotions?

Either way, she did know that it wasn't just the screaming. With each scream, it was almost as if she was experiencing that person's pain, what they had gone through. All those sentiments were rushing to her head, whether physical or emotional.

It was enough to make some people go mad, even if they had experienced this type of thing for a short while, but Layla was strong. She needed to constantly control her emotions to use the sword's powers and her True Hannya form.

After all, the negative emotions were what powered her, which was why she believed that this sword was the perfect partner meant for her. The more pain she handled, the stronger she would get.

"Now I warn you again. I'm giving you all of my Energy here, or at least as much as I think your body can take."

"If I give you any more, you'll go completely mad. So try to finish this fight quickly... otherwise, you might even end up going mad!" The sword said.

Layla couldn't respond because her concentration was focused on the sword while using this power, but she had heard the word loud and clear.

Laxmus was hovering in the air, with his shadow creating a larger version of himself that looked like a demon who had come to destroy the entire world. He was now angrier than ever and started to create a red aura sphere in his mouth and both hands.

The next moment, he fired them all directly toward Layla while flying towards her.

Seeing this, Layla stabbed her sword into the ground, which cut through easily. At the same time, multiple small black balls appeared all around the room. They were floating everywhere, and it seemed impossible to avoid all of them.

While Laxmus was flying, he had touched a few of them, and each time he did, a set of spiritual chains expanded from them, attempting to tie and slow Laxmus down, but he was quite literally a beast.

He continued to fly and would use the beam from his mouth to destroy the links of spiritual chains that were on him.

While lifting her sword, Layla noticed another attack coming toward her. So rather than spin the sword like the last time, she swung her sword and deflected the red aura at an angle.

It worked as the attack bounced and smashed into the wall, destroying it to pieces and the impact of this was enough to shake the entire building. Then, Laxmus fired another red beam, and Layla half expected it to come straight towards her, but instead, it left Laxmu's hand and went to the ground.

"Below!" The sword shouted, able to sense the energy.

Layla immediately stepped back and tried to move around as fast as she could, but the red beam attack just began to get larger and wider as it shot upward. Finally, the dust settled as the red beam dispersed, and now most of the lab's ceiling was obliterated.

As for Layla, thanks to her sword's warning, she was still in one piece but there was a rather deep wound on her arm. But she wasn't concerned about it because, in the next moment, flames appeared and enveloped the wound and now, the injury on her arm was almost non-existent.

"I can't just be on the defence. I have to attack as well!" Layla thought as she lifted herself into the air with her telekinesis powers.

The sword began to glow yellow, and soon after, she began to strike the air as fast as she could. Each time large yellow lines of aura would come out.

Now the shadow around Laxmus started shrouding his fists, and he flew straight toward Layla. With the shadow covering his fists, he punched the yellow aura like it was nothing and instantly broke through it without receiving a single injury.

"The shadow is more condensed when he's using it this way, and then he also has his natural strength... he's a brute!"

On top of that, Laxmus's speed was quick, as he had already reached Layla and crashed straight into her body. He pushed her through the walls of the Lab, breaking through them one at a time. Each time Layla back hit something, the force was so much that she felt like she was being hit by a spaceship.

Eventually, Laxmus changed his direction and pushed her upward towards the sky and out of the settlement. He then gave her a large kick with his foot, sending her far into the air.

Blood flowed from Layla's mouth, and when she opened her eyes, she realized that she was almost touching the ceiling of the underground settlement, and not only that, Laxmus at the same time was charging another of his Red Aura attacks, by combining hands and mouth.

"What's that noise I can hear... the screams of pain... but they're not in my head." Layla thought.

It was then that she noticed from this high up that she could see what was happening and the chaos unfolding in the settlement. It looked like a civil war was currently going on, and it was between her own people.

Whether or not she was a double agent, Layla had trained and lived with these vampires for a long time. One of her goals was to show these brain washed vampires a different point of view, but she could see some of them forgetting everything they had been through and attacking each other.

"This is partly my fault... And I need to deal with this!"

Layla held out her hand, and black balls appeared as she began to absorb the negative emotions from the fighting. At the same time, the black balls that had appeared earlier also started to move.

Layla was using her telekinesis to control the black balls, and each was moving fast towards Laxmus. It was too late by the time the latter noticed all of them around him.

They swarmed towards him, and if any of them touched him, it would create spiritual chains from the negative emotions and begin to bind him up. Laxmus tried to use his strength to break out of them, but there were just too many.

More and more chains started to wrap around Laxmus from head to toe, and eventually, they covered his entire body as if it was a cocoon.

While holding the sword towards her chest, Layla's good eye, which had yet to turn back, was beginning to change slightly.

"I told you to stop taking more energy from me. What are you doing?!" The sword yelled.

The sword started to light up in a bright white colour, and its form started to change. It almost looked like when one would use a soul weapon. The black sword had changed entirely, and now it was in the shape of a bow.

The marking on the bow was the same as the sword and was placed in the middle. It was black, and one could tell that the bow was made from the same material as the sword just from its look because they were the same weapon.

As for an arrow, Layla opened her mouth. Usually, flames would come out, but bright yellow energy began to form this time.

"Mother, thank you for giving me your energy. Yours, mine, and all the energy I have been gathering up this whole time... I am going to use all of it for a good cause!" Layla thought.

She then took out the Qi Arrow from her mouth. At first it was small, but soon began to grow in size. As to why the arrow came out of her body, it was because it wasn't ordinary Qi.

It was one made from her own life Qi. It was pulsating, becoming larger and smaller as if it was alive. Placing it on the bowstring and pulling it tight, Layla didn't hesitate as she let it go.

After the arrow left, it didn't end there, as she used her powers to spin the arrow and speed it up as fast as she could. The chains binding Laxmus were beginning to fade away, so she knew this was most likely her last chance.

However, just when the arrow was about to hit Laxmus, a huge explosion shook the whole settlement. Upon turning her head and staring in the direction of the explosion, Layla had a hunch about the person responsible for it.

"Erin..."

# Chapter 1779: The great attack.

The fighting between the Red Vampires had reached a high point. These vampires had a strong sense of pride in their belief that they were ready to risk their lives for their cause. And this only made the situation worse because they had no qualms about fighting their own kind.

Nearly all of the vampires had skill training every day to achieve their goal, and now they were fighting each other. Red aura was going off in all directions, buildings were getting destroyed in seconds, and people were dying every second from slashes and weapons.

A lot of the fighting had also reached the rooftops of the houses as there was inadequate space outside the lab. One could only describe the whole situation as chaotic as even the attacks from those on the same side hit each other.

Some didn't even know if they were fighting against those who disagreed with them or were trying to beat someone on their own side as they continued to punch, claw and slash anyone who attempted to attack them.

The only one getting quite a bit of support was Ashley, as they knew he needed help to take on the guardians against him. He was huffing and panting. The claw marks on his face and wounds over his body were healing much slower than before.

"Is this what you wanted?!" The Guardian shouted.

"Well done, thank you for causing the uprising that will have destroyed the Red Vampires and, in turn, the whole vampire race. You damned fake!"

Fake was a term used by many of the Red Vampires among each other. And they never used it in a good way. Rather, it was a derogatory term for vampires who weren't originally vampires and were the ones that were turned. However, the Vampires rarely used this word because it was considered very demeaning, and even the vampires aligned with Laxmus's ideal didn't agree with it wholly.

After all, the one who saved the vampires before and had done so much for them, Quinn Talen, was also a Turned.

"Just let us through and let us speak to Laxmus!" Ashley shouted.

At that moment, an energy blast was shot through the lab ceiling. It had just about reached the underground town's ceiling but stopped right before hitting the top.

Even if the fighting had gotten intense, it looked like Laxmus was careful not to destroy the very settlement he had built. Although the underground cave structure was built using carefully chosen material from the different planets to withstand powerful attacks, an attack of Laxmus's calibre could shake the foundations of the underground settlement, which was the last thing he wanted.

The leaders' fight continued, but most of the action on the ground halted when they saw Layla and Laxmus fighting against each other, confirming their suspicions that the two leaders were having some sort of disagreement.

However, as Vampires stared at what was to happen, a resounding message rang throughout their minds. And they heard someone's voice in their heads.

"Everyone, the Dhampirs have arrived. They are attacking the base. They have entered from the east side!"

Every single person at this point had stopped fighting and turned their heads, Immediately, they gripped their weapons and headed to the east side for possibly one of the most brutal battles they would ever have.

Ashley was frozen when everyone moved, including the Guardian Ashley was going toe to toe with.

"Why now of all times..." Ashley felt frustrated as he looked at his wounds, and some vampires, with most of their armour destroyed, who were heading into battle against their archnemesis. In fact, the whole ground was littered with corpses, but the vampires ignored everything and ran to the new battlefield.

"This is the worst time for an attack. We're tired and have been fighting each other. This would have been a hard fight in the first place, but now."

*** *** ***

At the same time, Xander, along with his son and daughter, who were fighting relentlessly with the other guardians, had all received the message as well.

"It looks like there are bigger problems to deal with instead of the nest crystal!" One of the Guardians spoke as he halted his attacks. In the next moment, all the guardians used their Shadow Travel to teleport and headed for the new battlefield, against the Dhampirs!

Seeing no one else around them, Xander decided to cancel his mist powers, and now the three of them could be seen standing on the rooftop. And just then, Kev fell to his knees.

"We survived... man, I was so worried," He was tired. "That was a lot harder than I thought it was going to be, and all we were doing was defending."

"Well, it was against the Guardians," June replied, looking in a bit better condition than Kev. It was hard to tell whether she was just trying to hide her nerves or tiredness, but Xander could only guess that she was also worn out.

"What should we do now? Do we continue our escape, or go back and... help?"

"We can't go back," Xander replied. Although he was unaware of the large fight outside the lab, he felt the power during the scuffle and honestly didn't want to know how it was going.

"We can't help, and no matter what, we must complete our task. Let's focus on getting out of this place."

"Wait!" Kev said, standing up. "You mean we aren't going to help them fight off the Dhampirs? You're a Guardian, dad."

"Your job is to protect the vampires. If you don't help them, many of them will die!"

"Was a Guardian." Xander corrected his son. "What do you expect us to do? Even if we help them fight the dhampirs and somehow win the battle, do you think they will suddenly forgive us for what we have done?"

"The battle against Dhampirs would have tired us even more, making it harder for us to escape."

"So right now, we are just focusing on escaping alive, you understand? And I don't want one of you to say anything else."

Kev kicked a rock as if he was sulking. They were brought up here and had made many friends in the settlement, many of whom they had grown up with. So it was harder for them to leave them to die. It didn't feel right.

However, they had been told from a young age what they needed to do and what might happen to them. Knowing how her brother felt, June placed her hand over his shoulder to comfort him. They had enough strength a Red Vampire would need to survive this.

Staring at their backs, Xander's heart pained as well.

"You think Layla and I didn't make friends during this time? Colleagues who were loyal to us and helped us."

"I want to help them to... But, I'm just choosing the best option, and this situation is the worst for us."

"The one thing we must do is avoid the dhampirs from finding us. They grow stronger based on how many vampires there are near them."

"The urge in their bodies rises, which is why fighting against them in small groups or one-on-one is more suitable."

"There is no way the Red Vampires can make it out of this, especially if the Dhampir Queen and her strongest have come."

Since he had made the decision, Xander took the two, and they started to run through the streets. They headed away from the east side where the Dhampirs had broken through. Although it was the main entrance to the place, it wasn't the only exit. There were several tunnels spread around that gave them enough chance to escape from the Dhampirs.

Xander knew the vampires very well. They will not run away and will choose to fight till the end. And even though his heart wanted to turn and rush to the war, he had to think about everything with his head. That's how he concluded that the best course of action was to escape from this settlement.

The three of them ran as fast as they could, through the empty houses, alleyways and buildings. Finally, a large wall appeared in sight, but still, it at least a mile away before they could reach it.

Kev was running the fastest in front of his sister, glanced back, and said aloud.

"Hey, sis, you didn't look tired before. So I guess you were just trying to act cool, huh?"

Shaking his head, Xander ignored this banter. He could never stop the competitive nature of these two, but then again, it was what had allowed them to get so strong, so quickly.

Suddenly, Xander's smile vanished as he pushed forward, running past June and grabbing Kev by the back of his collar before throwing him back.

At that moment, a large strike of yellow Aura came through the building on the side and cut through the ground. It had missed Xander by an inch and continued heading through the other houses.

"It looks like we have a few people trying to escape. I never thought the proud Red Vampires would do this."

Turning their heads to where the voice was coming from, they could see a female on the roof. She wore light clothing and white armour. It matched her long blonde hair well.

"Flora? Damn, of all the people to come here, Erin is probably the only one that's worse than her!" Xander cursed his luck.

Besides Erin, everyone counted Flora amongst the prominent figureheads of the Dhampirs. She made the most public appearances. Thus, she was a well known figure and was even at the Chained wedding. And this was not just because she was a pretty face but because she had the skills to back it up as well.

Honestly, Xander was wondering if he should just tell June and Kev to run or hand over Vincent's body to one and give the nest Crystal to the other because he didn't believe that the three of them could defeat Flora.

"Kids!" Xander shouted.

"AHHHH"

Interrupted by his words, he could hear a particular cry coming from above, and looking up, suddenly something had crashed and landed directly in front of Xander.

The impact created dust smoke, making it hard to see who or what it was.

"Damn it, what is wrong with that guy? Why wouldn't he let me smash through instead of using his powers? Now, look what's happened." All four at the scene heard a voice coming from the dust.

And as the dust started clearing up, Xander had to blink several times to ensure his eyes weren't playing tricks on him.
