# Chapter 1720: The Amra.

The white space was almost at its breaking point, and so was Quinn's anger.

And, knowing that this was all because of Bliss, Quinn believed that if he unleashed his energy, including part of his celestial energy, then maybe he could break out of this space and get to his friends before she could harm any of them.

While unleashing his energy, with the space breaking down, a bright flash of white light appeared, completely blocking his view, and suddenly everything around him disappeared.

Now finding himself in the air, the first thing Quinn felt was weightlessness and looking down, he saw the ground, but he was too high.

In the next moment, Quinn crashed into the ground and created a huge crater, and the residual red energy around him instantly erupted into a large flame, lighting up the whole area.

But before it could get out of hand. Quinn quickly contained the energy within himself.

"That was a bit of a rough landing." Quinn thought while staring at the night starry sky above him.

This was clearly not Green City, nor did he feel like he was on the Earth. For one, Quinn could see three moons, and one of them was purple for some reason.

The moon gave the whole area around him a purple hue that Quinn had only seen on different planets before.

"That damned woman, she brought me here...but for what?" Quinn thought to himself.

In the end, a sense of foreboding enveloped his mind. There had to be a reason why he didn't want Quinn with the others.

Worrying about his friends, Quinn quickly tried to use his shadow link skill, yet immediately he knew it wasn't working.

"Wait, what is going on? This makes no sense... why can't I link up with Minny? I could do it before. Did something happen to her?" All his thoughts suddenly paused.

His heart started to race, thinking about what could possibly have happened because one of the reasons could be that Minny was dead.

"No, I need to calm down and not overthink. I am dealing with an all-knowing Celestial here, and I can't connect to Laxmus either, so there must be another reason."

Either way, Quinn was left thinking about the whole situation he was in and was trying to figure out how he could leave this place.

For one, it looked like Bliss could teleport him, quite a great distance, which meant more and more likely she was most likely the one who had teleported him when he was in slumber.

"Why doesn't she want me to get so involved in everything?" Quinn thought, "Either way, I'm done listening to her and others."

"I need to just follow what I want to do, as I have been doing since the beginning. So the first step is to find someone who can help me get off this planet."

Upon searching around, there weren't any immediate signs of anything that Quinn could recognise.

For one, he couldn't see anything off in the distance that indicated any signs of civilization.

On top of that, the gravity on the planet was almost 20 times the Earth's gravity. Although it didn't affect Quinn much, he still felt a slight pressure on himself.

"I can't find anything. What if that woman put me on a planet with no life? Then how would I get back to Earth with no spaceship?" Quinn thought.

"Maybe there is a way for me to use my shadow and the wings and fly through space or something? I should be okay, right? If I'm a celestial now, do I still need oxygen?"

There were a lot of thoughts going through Quinn's head as he continued to find next to nothing.

In fact, there was no sign of beasts either. But after a long time, he suddenly came across a large lake of water.

"Water! That means there should be a sign of life here, right?" Quinn thought.

He quickly ran to the lake to see if he could spot anything, and immediately he noticed the sea life swimming around in the water.

Using his inspect skills, he could see they were beasts, but the beasts were of odd shape and looked like the ones he had seen before.

The sea beasts were covered in a strange rock-like substance; it was hard to believe they could swim as the rocks on their bodies looked quite heavy.

On top of that, the small fish in the lake were actually at the King Tier level, which surprised him.

Quinn couldn't imagine a fish of such a small size being at the king tier, although maybe it meant just the energy it produced was at the king tier. Either way, it wasn't something he was used to.

While looking around the Lake, Quinn eventually saw what looked like a human figure off in the distance. It was on the other side, and it looked like they were fishing, of all things.

"Finally, I found someone." Quinn thought.

Immediately, Quinn started to run across the water, allowing for a part of his shadow to hit the water so he wouldn't sink. This literally allowed him to run across the water.

It wasn't long before he reached the other side and was now standing next to the large figure, and he soon noticed something else about the person as well.

"You!! You!! You ran on the lake!!! What are you?!"

The large figure shouted as it stood up. At the same time, when noticing what Quinn looked like, it decided to let out a shriek as well.

"AHHH, what are you... you look nothing like an Amra! But at the same time, you do!"

Honestly, Quinn himself was taken aback as he looked at the person in front of him. Because there was one clear thing, this was not a human. The large figure was as large as the Dalki but was completely different from them.

This person had a grey-like texture on his skin while having large boulder-like muscles all over, but they also contained two distinctive features: the fact that it had four arms and a large rock-like mohawk on the top of his head.

"A Demon tier beast? And the one that can speak!" Quinn thought, now getting ready to act as he prepared himself for a battle.

A shadow covered his arms, and the gauntlets appeared on his hands once again.

"Wait... wait!" the large figure cried out once again, "Why are you attacking me... I don't want to fight! I just came here to fish. I'm not a beast!"

"Although I do think that you might be a beast because you look like some of the other beasts we have seen as well."

Seeing that the figure wasn't hostile, and Quinn wasn't getting any evil intent from the person, he decided to use his inspect skill before letting his guard down.

[?????]

Quinn's inspect skill failed this time. If it were a demon tier beast, the System would have at least let him know, which meant this person was telling the truth.

"I'm sorry, I don't know where I am right now, so I wondered if you could help me. Where are we... and what are you?" Quinn asked.

Just then, the fishing rod that had been placed on the ground started to move. The large figure grabbed the rod and pulled it with all four of its arms the next second.

Then, out from the lake, he pulled out a gigantic fish with rock-like scales on its body.

It was almost the size of a large house.

This time, using his inspect skill Quinn could tell that this was a beast.

[Demi-god tier beast]

Seeing the level of the beast in front of them and worried that they might be in trouble.

Quinn readied himself for a fight once again, but before he could act, the large figure had already jumped up.

It puffed out its chest, and then, clenching his four fists, he punched them out all at once, hitting the giant rock-like fish with so much force that the beast died instantly.

Before the fish fell back into the water, the person grabbed it by its tail and threw it onto the land. Soon after, landing right where he was before.

"Sorry about that; I have been trying to catch something for a long time now." The man smiled as he added, "To answer your question, you are on planet Amranion, and I am an Amra."

# Chapter 1721: Four arm friend.

Hearing these words from the strange-looking man, Quinn had a few thoughts going through his head, but one thing was quite odd with his system. Why had the inspect skill failed when using it against this person?

This was the first time this had happened. Could it possibly be that the system had no such information on them, unlike it did with the Dalki and the different beasts?

If that was the case, then it could mean that the person in front of him, the giant man with four arms and a rock-like structure base for a body, was an Alien.

A true and real alien, unlike the Dalki, who were artificial. Of course, beasts were also alien, but other than humanoid beasts, they didn't show much intelligence.

[Inspect]

Using the inspect skill again, this time, the information that had appeared was the same as the person in front of him had told him.

[Race: Arma]

"How can this be? This is another race with speaking intelligence, but why did Bliss send me here? Wait, how far exactly did Bliss send me here?"

"Humans, even in this time, have yet to discover other civilisations. How will I get back to earth?" Quinn started to think and, honestly, felt a bit uneasy.

"All is not lost yet; there is a good chance these people have technology that could allow them to fly, or maybe I can get in contact with Logan somehow, and he can just give me instructions on how to build something." Quinn thought.

Judging by the fact that the mysterious stranger was also surprised to see what Quinn looked like, he could guess they had never seen a human before.

"My name is Quinn." Quinn eventually said, realising it had been a while since he had spoken. "I'm a human from Planet Earth. Have you ever heard of such a place?"

"Earth?" The large man voiced, placing all four hands on his chin at once.

"I can't say that I have ever heard of a place before, but just because I haven't doesn't mean that no one will have."

"There is a good chance that someone in the city might be able to help you out."

The strange man was tying up his fish with some string, which wasn't giving Quinn hope about their technological advances, but at least he knew there was a city, so there was still hope.

"I'm sorry for scaring you earlier, my friend, but would you mind telling me where the city is or which direction it is in? It would be a big help."

The stone man put the fish onto his back after creating wooden contraception, and the large head cast a shadow over him. Then, smiling at Quinn, he nodded.

"The name is Geo, and I'm heading back there myself anyway. Why don't you tag along? And besides, it's better this way."

"If you were to enter. people would ask all sorts of questions. For now, I can just say you're an intelligent beast that I have decided to keep as a pet." Geo explained.

Although Quinn didn't like the round of being someone else Pet, he could tell that Geo was quite friendly and wasn't trying to hurt Quinn at all.

It reminded him of all the videos he watched as a kid that showed how hostile alien races would be towards humans, but that didn't seem to be the case this time.

"That's fine, I'm in a little bit of a rush though,how about we run to the city and get there as fast as we can? Will that be alright with you?" Quinn asked.

"Sure, I wanted to see what your race could do anyway. It is amazing to see that you can walk on water already. Humans are really interesting things." Geo replied.

The two were getting ready. Quinn wanted to see just how fast Geo could run, after all, he couldn't just run ahead of the latter since he had no clue where they were heading.

Also, Quinn wasn't as fast as he usually would be due to the gravity that his body had yet to adjust to.

Geo bent his legs and jumped up. Quinn was surprised to see him advancing through the air with a single jump.

He hardly made contact with the ground. Once was enough to send him a great distance, almost 50 metres in one direction, before he had to jump once again.

Of course, Quinn could keep up, but he had to constantly use his legs to push off as if he was running off the ground.

"Wow, this is great; your race is also incredibly fast. I thought with your small bodies, you would be increasingly slow." Geo said.

Quinn wanted to correct Geo, tell him that not all humans were like this, and Quinn wasn't even a human in the first place, but he was worried that information like this would lead to trouble.

For example, what would they think if they found out that many humans were weak or naturally slow? Moreover, he didn't want another Dalki to appear.

"Is this what Bliss wanted to show me? Another race? And what it meant to get involved in the celestials and the others?"

"Geo, you dealt with the Demi-god tier beast pretty easily, you must be a strong warrior or something. where you come from, right?" Quinn asked.

"Strong warrior." Geo's face turned slightly red.

"I am not skilled. I just know enough to help my family and my siblings get by. This is food for them and those in my neighbourhood. If I was truly skilled, then I would have become a Tower Warrior"

There looked to be a bit of distress on Geo's face when saying these words. Although Quinn was interested in learning what exactly Geo was talking about in terms of Tower Warrior, one thing was clear: they were stronger beings than Geo by his side.

Thinking about this, he couldn't help but wonder just how strong Geo was compared to him.

"We can slow down now; we are almost there," Geo said as he came to a sudden halt, and Quinn could see a strange structure off in the distance.

It was ginormous in size and was almost as big as a well established human city. The only word that Quinn could use to describe it was a tower. A large tower made of rocks pierced the skies, having a circumference as wide as a city

And at the same time, outside of the Tower, there was a wall, and beyond that. Quinn could only imagine a living area inside.

It was hard to say if the place was technologically advanced or not based on the outer structures.

The walls on the outside were uneven and crudely made of rock. Guards stood near the entrance, and the whole place looked like something that would have been made by human civilization around 3000 years ago if this was Earth.

However, at the same time, there was the Tower. The Tower alone looked beyond advanced, perhaps something that a genius like Logan would have created.

What Quinn didn't find though, was any flying spaceships of any kind, which was still a worry, but Quinn wouldn't give up hope.

"Just follow my lead for now, and it would be best if you don't talk while we are going through the entrance. Once we are in the city, it will be okay." Geo explained.

"The Guards are from the Tower, and they are always suspicious of people trying to take down the Tower."

"However, the people in the city don't believe that."

Something weird was going on, but more so than that, as Quinn got closer to the city and the huge Tower, he could feel something else, which was quite familiar to him: the celestial energy.

"What... is in that Tower? or, more importantly, what is at the top of that Tower?" Quinn couldn't help but ask after sensing the energy.

"That is where Athos lies, our God who watches over us," Geo replied with reverence in his eyes.

# Chapter 1722: Team.

"So this is the place? It's pretty big and impressive, and there are even robots everywhere!" Minny jumped with joy while looking at all the technology around them, especially in the newly built arena.

The future had somewhat been disappointing for her. What was the point of waking up a thousand years later if everything was the same? But Green city was a completely different experience.

"So who are we meant to meet here? All I can see are these scary-looking guys." Jessica complained.

Currently, the group was under the arena. They had arrived at the meeting place before the audience came in a couple of hours. However, they weren't alone. The contestants taking part in the challenge were also in the same room.

Due to them being special guests, they could enter the waiting area with all the other participating contestants.

"He just said to wait here, and someone would come and take us, so let's just wait here quietly," Mitchell stated, walking towards one of the stalls, and decided to order some refreshments for the others.

One could just say the word menu, and a holographic screen would appear in front of them. Then he can order the meal he wants, and a drone or Al robot will come and deliver it to them.

Eventually, one of the contestants with a scar wide across his mouth decided to speak up to them.

"You guys know that this is a solo event, right? There is no group work here."

It was clear that the man had commented due to the clothes they all were wearing and the strange masks covering their faces.

"We are just friends." Muka eventually said, standing in front of them, still wearing the sunglasses that covered her eyes.

"There are other groups of friends who have entered this place, so I don't think there is a problem with us being here, and besides, we haven't even decided to enter the competition, so why don't you mind your own business?"

"You haven't entered the competition?" The scarred man raised an eyebrow, and the others who could hear also found their words a bit strange.

"So you haven't entered the competition, and you're hiding your faces. This isn't a good look, you know. Just take off your masks if you have nothing to hide." The man started to walk over towards them, but he soon saw that each of the other members was standing behind Muka, ready to support her at any second.

Not that she needed it, which caused the man to shrivel up a bit and back away.

It looked like he was trying to cause some commotion and have some people follow him, but it didn't exactly work out that way.

"There really are troublesome people everywhere. I guess while we are here, we might as well try and gauge the other contestants." Hannah suggested.

"There is no harm in getting a head start."

The group agreed and split up in the room. Minny, Jessica and Lucia stayed in the waiting spot that Logan had told them to stay at while the others looked for anyone related to the Red Vampires, or perhaps anyone who would at least have some information about them.

Naturally, the contestants had split up into groups. Those from Pure who knew each other stuck close.

The high A rank travellers didn't band together, and they stayed apart since they weren't so heavily affiliated with the others factions.

Then, there were some vampires too. Eventually, after getting back, everyone shared the information they had gathered so far.

"So, the suspicious ones so far are, or the ones to look out for so far, are two Triple AAA rank contestants," Muka explained, first looking in the direction of the large man with knuckle type beast weapons named Greg.

"From the information gathered so far, Greg is the favourite to win this event. There has to be a reason why people are so confident in him and why he has such strength."

"But, Icas, the man whose body is wrapped from head to toe apart from a single eye, is also another one."

"Other than that, there are also some vampires. The red vampires, according to Hannah, often are in groups, and that would be true, but what has caught my attention more than anything are the two vampires, who seem, to have come on their own and aren't part of the other factions."

"A vampire to come here on their own? They must have a lot of confidence in their strength. So I say we keep an eye out on them as well."

The two vampires in question were leaning against the wall, covered in dark clothing and obscuring their faces from the others.

"Well, at least we know who to watch out for in the event, and we can just have a general look anyway," Lucia commented.

It was then that a traveller walked up to their group, and as a surprise, it looked to be the same scared man who had criticised them before. His face was a little red as he seemed somewhat embarrassed.

"You guys are a group, right? Well, this is a bit embarrassing, but I guess you were ahead of the others before they started." The man said, his words not making sense.

"Should I get rid of this idiot?" Peter was annoyed, already stepping forward and ready to punch him.

"No, wait," Muka stopped him, "Didn't you hear him say something strange?"

Then turning towards the man in front of them, she asked, "So, what do you want now?"

"Well, I was wondering if I could join your group. Everyone else has already kind of made their own groups." The man explained.

"And, no one will let me join their group. I don't come from this city and have always been a solo traveller, but I don't want to be knocked out before the contest even starts."

"Wow, he really changed his tune. Where's all the attitude from before, huh?" Jessica said out loud.

Clicking her fingers, Muka believed she had figured something out. It was often she would take the complicated cases of the vampire settlement on herself, and she always had a curious mind which seemed to come in use, and now was one of such times.

"There are too many people here, and it looks like almost everyone here is participating in the event. It's most likely that there will be a preliminary round to eliminate everyone who's just here for fun."

"People are making alliances to get through the probable elimination round without a hiccup."

"That's right, so please, can I..." Before the man could even finish his sentence, he found a hand covering his face with a powerful force that he couldn't even resist.

"Did you not hear what we said? We are not even taking part in this event!" Peter scowled, "So get lost before I make sure you can't even get to the elimination!"

"Now that's not nice, is it." A voice suddenly interrupted from behind.

Upon seeing whose voice it was, the hall suddenly quietened down, and the participants couldn't help but talk in murmur and whispers.

"Is he taking part in this event as well? If that's the case, I guess the winner is already decided."

"But, this isn't fair. I am sure they planned something not to let him participate; after all, he can rig the competition to win it."

The reason for everyone's worry was because Jake Green had entered the room.

"Relax, you guys, even if I were taking part, I wouldn't be taking the prize. It would just show how much better I am than all of you." Jake smiled.

"Anyway, you must be the guests my father told me to look after."

Seeing the group, Jake started to look the members up and down. He had heard a bit about them from his father but didn't really know about their identities.

"My father is putting a lot of hope in these guys... maybe it wouldn't be so bad to see what they got."

Lifting his hands, Jake smiled.

"Alright, everyone, we will have a preliminary elimination round, right here, right now, in this room. Let's begin!"

***

# Chapter 1723: 10 percent.

The event was planned to last two days at most, but with how many people signed up and over a 1000 contestants, it became clear that something needed to be done. At first, the contestants thought that they would be pre-requirement.

This way, not anyone off the street could join, and in truth, Logan did think of that, but due to what the event had become, a way to search for the Red Vampires, Logan believed that he needed to allow anyone to join, and decided to change up things.

With Jake Green's arrival and announcement, the groups were huddled up even more than before and distanced themselves away from others.

At the same time, it now became clear who had been unable to find a group as well.

Even those that greatly disliked those like Greg had people surrounding him, all perhaps trying to use him for his known strength.

Looking around the room, Jake just smiled.

"How are you always right about these things, father? You predicted everything that they would do. Oh well, let's just see how they will get on with this."

"The rules are as follows!" Jake announced, and behind him, a large screen displayed the familiar Black Al robots they had seen before.

"Take one of these out, and that is your ticket to today's event."

Out from the ground, in random locations spread out, the Black robots started to rise, and immediately, they started to be on the move, flying and running all over the place.

"There are only around 100 robots in this room. Does that mean that they're only going to pass around 10 percent of the people here?" Jessica asked.

"I assume that's the goal" Muka replied as she walked forward to a certain position in the room.

It was almost as if she was searching for something, and eventually threw her trusty coin in the air. It landed on the floor and rolled to a particular location.

Raising her hand, she moved her fingers, gesturing to the others to come towards her, which they did.

"This is a safe spot; as long as we stay here, all the lasers, abilities, and everything will go right over our heads and miss us; we won't have to do anything." Muka explained.

The group stood there for a while, and it seemed what she was saying was true, how that was possible; they didn't really try to ask questions or the logic behind Muka's strange powers.

"But this really is clever. If they knew that the others were going to team up, now it's pretty pointless."

"Although they could get a robot quicker, how do you split one robot between the ten of you? This has just made the whole event another free for all," Muka explained.

Continuing to stay in Muka's spot, they had a good view of everyone participating and fighting.

They could see that the two triple AAA rank travellers had already destroyed two of the robots. The robots were clearly the same ones Peter had fought, meaning they were resilient.

Even if others had hit them with their abilities and weapons, they wouldn't break on the spot. Still, Greg had managed to smash one to pieces with his fists.

Seeing this, Mitchell and Minny looked toward Peter, wondering if he would be a little jealous.

"I hit harder than him. I promise you that. It must be his gloves, or he uses Qi in a special way." Peter commented.

They noticed that even though Icas and Greg had already destroyed a robot, Icas had decided to stop fighting but not Greg.

He continued going for other robots, still attempting to destroy more of them, and in fact, he also would hit a few of the other contestants if they got in his way.

"Wow, that guy really is an arse. No wonder no one likes him that much," Jessica said, somewhat glad they weren't taking part in the event.

Just then, a certain individual came landing right in front of them, with a destroyed robot in their hands.

"That's ticket," Jake said.

"Hey, I know I was my meant to be looking after you guys, and my dad said you didn't have to enter, but I thought at least one of you would have wanted to take part."

"I was interested in seeing what you got. I mean, doesn't going up against any of these guys or proving you're better than them excite you?"

"What does it matter? We need to keep our identity hidden in the first place, and we have nothing to gain from the prize anyway." Mitchell replied.

"Fair enough," Jake replied, shrugging his shoulders a little disappointed, but he did understand where they were coming from, so they continued to watch the others taking part, and kept a very close eye on the two vampires from before.

They both hadn't acted so but were finally making a move. They got off from the back wall and started to walk peacefully, moving slightly to avoid stray attacks and more.

A group of people were chasing one of the robots, and it looked to be heading straight towards one of the robe figures.

Flapping his robe, so it wouldn't get in his way, the vampire looked to ready himself, getting in position as he pulled his hand back, then red aura gathered around his fist.

The aura started to take shape as it was beginning to look somewhat like a drill.

The blood aura was spinning and spinning with power, and at the right time, he threw the blood drill forward, smashing it right on top of the robot's head.

The drill penetrated the top, and parts flew everywhere until the vampire's arm was halfway up the robot's body. It had been completely destroyed.

"It looks like he has quite the strong blood aura," Hannah commented. "There is a good chance he could be with the Red Vampires."

Looking at the other vampire though, they saw something that surprised them even more because suddenly, a wall of shadow was used to block other participants from seeing what was happening.

It blocked the way between the robot and the vampire, and when the shadow went away, the robot was defeated.

No one had seen what the vampire had done, but the fact that there was someone who could use the shadow was ringing alarm bells from them all.

The other contestants that saw this backed away and weren't going to attempt to get close to perhaps what was a guardian.

"It's not, dad," Minny said, shaking slightly. "I can feel it's not dad... the shadow... it doesn't feel the same as dads."

Seeing this and seeing what had occurred. Muka decided to say something. She walked over and began whispering into Peter's ear.

"I think this will be the best course of action." Muka said, the last sentence out loud, nodding towards Peter.

The event looked like it was coming to an end, as there were only a few robots left. However, participants didn't feel safe, and that was mainly due to one person, Greg.

The triple AAA rank traveller, now no longer able to easily get hold of robots even though he had already taken out three, was now fighting against contestants.

"You guys shouldn't have wasted my time even joining in the first place!" Greg shouted as he threw his fist, hitting another traveller with a shield, smashing right through it and sending them skidding across the ground.

"Did you notice, although, with all that shouting and bravado he has behind him, he hasn't been going after anyone who seems to be half a decent fighter." Lucia stated.

Lucia gripped the amulet around her chest, there was quite a bit of blood that had split in the room, and it was providing her amulet with energy for the first time since she had obtained it.

"That man is such a bully!" Minny shouted.

It was loud enough for many in the room to hear, and it looked like it had caught the attention of the large Greg himself.

"Oh, I'm a bully, huh." Greg smiled, now walking towards their group, which had avoided everything so far.

"I guess I was a bit too nice leaving you guys in the middle who had yet to do anything."

Greg started to run over to their position. Jake looked like he was ready to move, but before he did, Muka stopped him.

"Don't worry," Muka said.

Currents were beginning to follow Greg's fist, as it looked like he was activating some type of ability.

"I'll wipe out your whole group in a single hit!"

The fist was thrown, and it was stopped, being held by a single person that was standing there.

"I can see you guys didn't believe me so much back then, but I don't lie..." The person who had grabbed the fist was none other than Peter. He readied his own hand, gathering his Qi around it.

There was no need for him to use Celestial Energy for this one. Letting go of Greg's fist with one hand, Peter stepped in towards his chest and threw out his Qi infused fist, landing right on the other's chest.

Greg was now nothing but a blur as he flew through the air and crashed into the wall, leaving an imprint of himself and blood dripping out from his mouth, while a large ident could also be seen in his chest.

"I told you, I was stronger than that guy." Peter proved.

***

# Chapter 1724: Surprise entry.

A loud buzzer was sounded, indicating that the preliminary round for the event was over.

Usually this would be where those that had success in going into the next round would be jumping for joy, but that wasn't the case as all eyes of the contestants were looking at two people in particular.

One of them, Peter, who still had his fist held out, and the other, Greg, who could not move from the wall, as if he was a permanent piece of the wall.

"Did I see that right? That was Greg, the triple AAA rank Traveller, the favourite to win!Who..who was able to take out someone like that!"

Looking over at Peter, others tried to see if they could notice him, but none of them could.

It was no one well known, and usually, in cases like these, even if it were someone unknown, they would soon be telling their name to all, but instead, Peter just walked back to the others.

"Hey, I think I might have grown stronger, I guess I won't have to rely on that other form as much." Peter said, a little pleased with himself and looking at his knuckles.

Eventually, several staff members came out, including more robots, and the one that would be hosting the event was Vicky Blade.

"Alright, everyone, who has not managed to defeat a robot, please head to the exits located on your right and left."

"All those that have passed, if you could remain in the current room, please." Vicky shouted out.

"You guys can just stay here for a little bit," Jake explained. "We have a special viewing area for you, and besides, I'm guessing they're going to decide what to do with you."

As to who you were referring to, it was Peter.

"What do you mean?" Muka asked.

"I mean, he didn't defeat a robot, but he defeated the favourite who had defeated three. We're just wondering if others will complain if we let him in or not."

"I assume that was your intention when hitting him, right?" Jake asked.

Peter shrugged his shoulders.

"No, I just listened to Muka. Honestly. I didn't even want to listen to her until he started charging towards us."

Jake just shook his head, thinking that the situation was just getting more complicated, but at that moment, Greg had managed to be pulled out from the wall.

"We won't have to worry about that, trust me," Muka said, and they soon could see what she was talking about.

It wasn't a coincidence that the event had ended when Greg had been hit because behind his body was a crushed robot, the final one.

"It looks like you got your ticket after all," Muka said. "Just remember to do the rest."

The group started to move because they could see Vicky was calling them over.

She then informed them to follow one of the AI robots, which proceeded to take the rest of the group out of the room, and as promised, they were in their very own special area.

They were directly in there with the crowd but were watching from their own private glass booth.

The stadium had been packed with people, and it looked like they were all busy talking and cheering with excitement just seconds ago, which was a bit Strange.

"I thought, the event hasn't started yet. What's going on?" Jessica asked.

To which Mitchell pointed at the large screen above their heads, where they could see on the screen, Peter. The scene where he had punched Greg being repeated in slow motion.

"Ladies and gentlemen, please be ready to give a round of applause to your contestants!" The announcer claimed.

The whole stadium felt like it was shaking, and in the centre of the stadium, on the ground, the floor could be seen opening up.

Pushing up from the ground, the whole floor was a platform, and on that platform was everyone who had fought just moments ago.

Viky had gathered them to stand in a line and had given them a few instructions, such as to wave to the people as they saw them.

Although most of the 85 or so contestants had done so, those like Peter continued to have their arms folded!

The whole event was broadcasted the second the preliminary round had started. It was a nice surprise for the audience to watch those at home and on other planets.

Since most of it was just those showing off their powers, it was quite exciting, but there were certain things that had been seen that were more popular topics.

One of them being the use of the shadow ability.

"Hey, I know that we should feel safe being in Green city and all, but I was just wondering, seeing that shadow, doesn't it make you feel and remind you of that Crazy Bloodlord?"

Many people had the same thought since it was something that happened recently.

They didn't think that the Red Vampires would come out so crazily like so, but if it was the crazy blood lord, the one that seemed to not be scared of anyone, then they thought it was a good chance.

However, rather than being scared that he could be here, the people were more excited that they would see him in action.

"I have a question for you then. Who do you think would win if the Crazy Bloodlord went up against Quinn Talen?" One of those in the crowd asked.

"Are you crazy? You're talking about the great hero. Of course, he would win."

"Are you forgetting, the Crazy Bloodlord, took on the entirety of the Chained, and at the same time, he was able to summon that Dragon Dalki thing. We haven't seen the Crazy Bloodlord's full strength either."

It certainly was an interesting topic, but most believed that Quinn Talen would win without a doubt.

Most people were from Green City, and they believed a lot of the rumours about his great strength.

After the cheers started to die down, Vicky began to introduce the contestants one by one.

She would ask them their name, their current occupation, and what they hoped to achieve in this event.

After each person stated their name, there were quite respectful cheers and claps from most people in the crowd and only a few boos here and there.

At the same time, a couple of people also decided not to comment about where they were from, such as the vampire who had shown off its shadow powers.

As for when the other vampire was asked, this one didn't choose to stay silent.

"Now, everyone, we have quite the interesting one here," Vicky said.

"When asking to put down their name, they decided to go with the great name Quinn Talen."

Hearing this, immediately, boos started to erupt from the stadium. "Get out of here, you fake!" Many shouted.

"What's your reason for putting down that name? Is it someone you respect, or did your family choose that name due to the Hero, or perhaps you are one of the many imposters.

The crowd gave a chance for the vampire to speak because they were interested in what he had to say.

"I am here to let everyone know that I have returned. You will all soon see." The man said. Still making sure the orb covered his face.

The noise continued and in the end, it looked like Vicky had to move on to get the crowd to stop, but the noise turned to cheers as she stopped at a specific person who had managed to defeat the one and only Greg.

"Everyone is interested to know, who are you?" Vicky asked.

Before speaking, Peter looked out into the crowd and met eyes with Muka for a second. He remembered back to her words.

"Remember you're doing this for Quinn." Peter thought.

"It will be better if I showed you," Peter stated, and his body started to change.

Peter's transformation ability was shifting his body, his hair was growing his height was changing, and eventually, everyone could see who he was.

"It's... the Crazy Bloodlord; he actually entered the event!"

# Chapter 1725: The imposter Quinn.

The confident air, the long hair, and the absurd strength were enough to beat the event's favourite with a single hit. It now all made sense that the one behind it all was the infamous Crazy Bloodlord.

His image had been burned into many minds that day, and now they were seeing him again, and so soon at that, at another widely publicised event. The people couldn't stop trying to guess just what was Crazy Bloodlord's goal.

"What is this guy planning? How is he coming out of nowhere and turning up like this."

"I don't know, but it's kinda cool, right? I mean, no one knows about this vampire, and if he's here, he must be interested in the reward related to Hero Quinn."

"What if he attacks everyone in the stadium or summons that dragon on us? Relax, didn't you watch all those reports carefully."

"That guy didn't harm a single reporter, and even then, it looked like he was trying to talk to the Chained We all know what the Chained were like, and their reputation was well-deserved."

"That vampire was just being a romantic, trying to save that Jessica girl from her wedding. So I think him being here is nothing to worry about, and I hope we get to see him a bit more."

The reaction was primarily positive, as there were loud cheers for the Crazy Bloodlord. After all, they just wanted to see a show, and during the Chained event, they could not directly see how strong he was.

Now, this was their chance. Peter stood silently with his arms crossed, not reacting to the crowd's response because he didn't like this idea as much as Muka had suggested.

However, he understood they were taking Vorden's advice to spread a name as a significant consideration for this plan.

A new name of the Crazy Bloodlord was something that people would support and come together for, and he would become a hope for the people once again. What Peter didn't like was the fact that he was a fake.

"Quinn, all of this should be you; you never got to reap the rewards for the sacrifices you make."

"You never got to feel this satisfaction from the general public for everything you have done for them."

After the introductions were over, each contestant was instructed to wait in a certain area.

They all had their own rooms around the edge of the stadium, just under where the seats currently were.

Finally, it was time for the event to start.

"Let's see which contestants will be able to get through the first five waves!" Vicky shouted, and the others roared in response.

The Al would randomly call out the participants' names, after which they were to take centre stage.

Vicky had moved out of the way, rising on a platform, where the base soon disappeared.

At the same time, she would try her best to make sure the crowd wouldn't get hurt.

Even though there was also a forcefield to protect them from inside the fighting area, she was there to keep things under control.

The event had begun, and a single black Al robot rose from the ground. This was the first wave. The participants had to do their best to take out the single robot.

Considering how they had already done this to get a ticket, many believed that the first wave wouldn't be difficult for the participants on the stage.

However, for some reason, when watching them fight one on one, the participant seemed to be struggling.

"There is a difference in the room and out here," Muka stated, carefully watching everything.

"Also, the robots are fighting back here; they're not just running around."

It was true, but the participant was able to beat a single robot in the end. Immediately after, round 2 began with the same participant, and this time, two robots appeared on the field, and the participant had to now go against them.

The participant was fighting well and was fighting in a way Peter had never seen before because he was using different crystals to control the flow of the battle.

Crystals that would explode, create smoke screens, and sometimes even release different powers.

With all these different uses, the participant made it to the third round before getting knocked out by the robots.

Once the participant was defeated, there was a round of applause from the crowd as the next person stepped on the stage to take on the robots.

As time passed, more and more participants appeared on the stage. Unfortunately, most of them failed in the third round, with a single person from Pure managing to make it to the fourth round.

Some of them had even used the fourth stage of Qi, turning their skin red and increasing their speed, but in the end, the robots were just too strong and skilled.

Nevertheless, the AI robots that defended Green city were impressive, and it gave the citizens confidence seeing that none of the participants could pass the fifth wave until a well-known face stepped on the stage.

Jake Green.

Using a display of different powers and flashy techniques, he performed well and quickly became the first to finish all five waves.

"That's the world's strongest human, right there!" Someone in the crowd cheered.

"Keep kicking butt out there and protecting our city!" Another person cheered.

While other participants were having their turn, a message had come through, both to those in the booth and to Peter, who had been waiting so far.

"Try not to act surprised, but it's me, Logan. I have been watching the event so far." Logan explained to Peter.

"The room you are in is one way, meaning you can see what's happening in the stadium, but they can't see you."

"Peter, I know you can take on all my robots, but I want you to take it easy and try to take it as long as possible. It will be your turn next."

*** *** ***

At the same time, another message was being sent out to the group, and after hearing what Logan had to say, they agreed and came up with a plan.

"Some of us should stay here. I think only a few should go down as to who we should go see first... maybe the one that calls themselves Quinn Talen is the best one to go for." Muka explained.

Since Muka usually thought through her plans, they were content to go along.

Those who had decided to leave the booth were Lucia, Mitchell, and Hannah, while Minny, Muka and Jessica stayed in the booth, ready to let them know when Peter's turn was over.

Peter had stepped onto the stage by now, and the audience was expecting some big things from him, but of course, he knew what his task was, and he was going to stick to it.

The first Robot appeared, and Peter threw out a punch without using his Qi. He planned to go toe to toe with the Robot for a while.

However, when Peter's fist smashed into the Robot's head, the latter immediately smashed it to pieces.

"Am I this strong..." Peter was quite taken aback as he looked at his fist. But he didn't have much time to think as the second wave of robots appeared in front of him.

*** *** ***

Inside one of the booths, a participant was spectating the fight very carefully.

He certainly found Peter interesting, with how his strength had grown, and judging by his own actions, it was as if Peter didn't understand his own power and progression.

In the middle of watching the match, the back door to the booth opened up.

"Oh, it looks like the Green family isn't as honourable as I first thought." The robbed figure said, turning around.

He could see Mitchell and the two girls by their side, ready for a fight and confrontation. Even Lucia already had lighting wrapping around her spear.

"Why did you call yourself Quinn Talen? We know you are not the real one!" Mitchell asked, angry that someone would imitate his master.

"I think you should all calm down. I did it to attract attention, and it looks like it worked."

The robbed figure removed his hood and took off his mask as he spoke.

As soon as they saw his face, they were shocked. Lucia even almost dropped her spear. Because the person in front of them really was Quinn Talen and exactly identical to the statues.

# Chapter 1726: Four or Two.

It was somewhat as Quinn had imagined it would be. The city that Quinn was currently in felt like he had leapt back through time.

There were crudely made stone-like structures for buildings, although a lot bigger than human houses.

Then, there were blacksmiths, and market places outside in the streets, while also having a community-like feel all around the area.

The Amra race were very friendly to each other, as they all waved and said hi to Geo.

It was amazing as they could do tasks with two hands while also greeting each other with the others.

On top of that, there was something else Quinn noticed: the Amra females.

They had human-like structures, and they were muscular like giant women.

The women looked more human as they had two hands rather than four like their male counterparts.

However, they had four large breasts in two separate rows of each other.

Their clothing covered up most of their breasts, but Quinn could tell they had nothing underneath to support them, which was causing him to be quite distracted.

"You're quite the little pervert, I see. I guess you humans are true warriors like us as well." Geo said.

"No, it's not that... I mean... it is, but it's just there so big... and so... our women don't look like this." Quinn replied.

He thought that since he changed and became a Celestial, he wouldn't feel embarrassed, but it looked like he could.

At first, Quinn was getting quite a bit of attention. There were many looking at him, but it was mostly the females. He didn't have his charm skill active, but apparently, his good looks could even transpire races.

"You have a handsome face, so the women seem to like you, but I'm afraid if they ever were to lay you, all of your bones would be crushed in seconds."

"It's a good thing you are small. As expected, no one is paying you any bother or attention" Geo explained.

"They can't imagine you would be a threat to them."

Although some people may have found it offensive, Quinn quickly realised that it was just how Geo was, he was direct with his thoughts and was speaking his mind.

Right now, the two of them were heading to Geo's home, his neighbourhood that was located in a part of the city, but Quinn couldn't help looking at the large tower, wondering what was inside.

"Geo, Geo, Geo!" The sound of several high pitched voices was heard, and turning his head, Quinn could see what he could only guess where Amra kids running up to Geo.

There were around fifteen of them, all giving Geo a big hug, and some even punching his legs and back.

It was strange because, with each impact, Quinn could hear how heavy the blows were, but he imagined that the kids were just playing.

"On top of their great strength, it looks like they also have solid bodies. This is quite the impressive race." Quinn thought.

After playing and greeting the kids back, Geo turned around to Quinn.

"Sorry about this. I just need to make a quick stop. Once I get my little neighbourhood all sorted, we can head a couple of streets down."

"There's A knowledgeable ex-Tower worker who might know about your kind."

Seeing that Geo was talking to Quinn, all of the kids started to peek and looked at Quinn. Soon, they rushed over with stars in their eyes.

"What is it? What did you bring back with you? Is this to eat as well!!" One of the kids asked.

Although they were kids, the Amra kids were the size of a fully regular adult human, so it was quite the frightening image seeing around ten of them storm toward Quinn.

"Careful... he is something I picked up while hunting. He is intelligent and can talk, but be careful otherwise you might break him."Geo explained.

Because of this, the kids started to poke Quinn instead, feeling his soft and fluffy exterior that was completely different to theirs, and soon they began to ask questions.

Seeing that Quinn seemed to be okay, Geo went ahead and started to call all the adults out.

They were amazed by the big catch he had received, and it looked like all the others in the neighbourhood were now helping cook the giant fish. Eventually, the kids started to play a game of soccer.

They had grown bored of Quinn but invited him to play, although they were a little worried that he might not be able to kick the ball.

When the ball was brought out, Quinn could now understand why they were concerned.

Dropping the ball, the ground around it shook for a second. It had to at least weigh 300 kg and was made of solid rock.

"Okay, but how do we do fair teams? I mean, whoever has Quinn will be at a disadvantage." Gina said.

"We will just have to do numbers!" Another boy called Solace replied.

A random number was given to all those that would be playing in the game, and then the two captains would have to pick random numbers, deciding who would be on their team.

This way, the one ending up with Quinn couldn't really complain; it was just their luck.

"Ah man, this sucks!" Solace replied as he looked at Quinn in disappointment.

"Okay, skinny, do you mind just staying in goal for the game. At least for the first half and then I'll get someone to swap with you later."

"I know it sucks being in goal, but Gina's won the last two games, and because we're the best players, we can't really be on the same team."

There honestly was no need for them to explain. Quinn was happy to be in goal. This was just a kid's game in the first place

He was just wasting time until Geo had finished cooking, and he was wondering if he could get some answers from the kids.

Kids often were more honest than adults, and they could maybe tell him more about the tower and the one that resides in it.

The game started, and the Amra kids were kicking the heavy ball like it was a regular soccer ball.

Just from the sports they played, one would tell how powerful they were, and this version of the sport was more brutal.

While having the ball, it looked like the arms were free to use their brute strength to push the others out of the way with their arms, so strength was a big part of the sport.

Eventually, Solace had gotten into the strike zone. He kicked the ball hard and fast, and it looked to have broken the sound barrier as a little dust cloud was made.

The goalkeeper, on the other side, readied all of his hands and put them out, stopping the ball from crossing the line.

"Damn it, I just realised something," Solace said.

"Our goalkeeper only has two arms. He's at a serious disadvantage. Maybe putting him in goal wasn't a good idea after all."

It was too late, as the goalkeeper threw the ball, and it landed right by Gina's feet.

She ran ahead and spun forwards, knocking over two defenders, pushing them out of the way.

She had her eyes set on the goal, and when ready, she readied her leg, giving it her all, basting the ball.

The ball went just as fast as when Solace hit it.

"Gina, what are you doing? If that ball hits him, it might kill him!" Solace shouted.

His original intention of putting Quinn in goal was for the other side to take an easy, but it didn't seem like Gina would be doing that.

Everyone looked in horror as the heavy ball went straight at Quinn, but Quinn just held out his hand and stopped the ball with his palm open in place, not even skidding across the ground a single inch.

"I'm still not quite used to the gravity, but I can still see the ball very clearly, and I'm not a normal human or vampire." Quinn smiled.

"This is good training, but you're going to have to kick the ball harder and faster than that to make it worth my while."

***

# Chapter 1727: God's Tower.

The soccer match continued, and eventually, the kids on the Solace team stopped trying to get the ball from the other side. It might sound a bit confusing but they were literally letting their opponent through, allowing the other team to take shots at goal because what they were seeing wasn't something they had ever seen before. Right before their eyes, they witnessed the skills of a legendary goalkeeper.

Using his speed, eyesight, prediction, reflexes and strength, Quinn was able to stop every single incoming shot, and he did so with ease. In the end, the kids looked to have given up on the team Vs team match, and even those on the Solace team were just shooting balls toward Quinn, to watch him block the ball.

It was truly a sight to behold for the kids because they themselves knew how near-impossible it was to block all goals.

"This is amazing, not even the adults can block every single one of our hits, and this person is so small; how is this possible?" One of the Amra said.

"Who is Quinn? Is he a famous soccer player or something? Wait, he's a beast, right? What is he?" Solace thought.

After playing for a while and still not being able to score any goal against Quinn, the kids were tired and decided to take a break for a while. Honestly, Quinn welcomed it as he shook his arms that were becoming slightly sore from the repeated hits.

The kids were taking their shots with more and more strength every time. Although, Quinn did get used to one thing: gravity. He could pretty much move as fast as he could do before, or at least comparable to when he was on Earth. During the break, the kids couldn't stop asking Quinn certain questions.

"How could you stop our balls so easily, especially since you look so weak?" Gina asked.

"Yeah, even the adults are afraid to block mine and Gina's shots, but you took them on no problem at all. Only Geo has ever done that." Solace asked.

"Ah, that, well, where I'm from, we have a similar game, and I have good reflexes," Quinn replied.

"Speaking of Geo, earlier, you said he was the only-one that would be able to stop your shots; he must be quite strong compared to the others then, right?" Quinn asked.

While saying this, Quinn looked at Geo and could see how the others around him respected him a lot. The other adults were showering him with gifts. It was clear he was special, at least in this neighbourhood.

"Of course, Geo is strong," Gina said.

"He's strong enough to go to the Tower and become a tower soldier, but instead of living a good life in the Tower, he decided to stay with us and look after everyone. Geo's the best."

"Yeah!" The other kids agreed. It looked like Quinn's opinion of Geo was right. He really was a naturally good person.

"Do you guys mind telling me more about this tower, and we can play again after that?" Quinn asked.

The kids were happy to answer Quinn's questions, and he had learnt a lot from them. First, the Tower was where their God resided, the one that was the ruler of the land and the city. At the same time, it was where only certain Amra were allowed to live.

According to the children, all Amra wished to live in the Tower, and at any point in time, they could try to climb the Tower, but climbing the Tower wasn't easy, even if it was something anyone could attempt to do many lost their lives in trying to climb it.

Each floor was filled with dangerous tasks and trials, making it hard for a person to move up. If a person could pass the first ten floors out of the hundred, they would be allowed to live on the tenth floor.

Not just them but their family would be able to live there. Life in the Tower was easy and is a lot more luxurious than outside. It is a common goal for the children to enter the Tower and reach the tenth floor at least.

Those who have reached the tenth floor sometimes come out and are known as the Tower guards. They also kept order and controlled the city. It was their job.

According to them, there were higher positions than that in the Tower as well, reaching levels 25, 50, 80 and 90. Reaching these floors presented one with a better quality of life. The floor themselves would have no trials on the specific floor and were the living area for those ranks.

Then, there was the 100th floor, where their God resided. For as long as the Amra can remember, they have only had one leader, and no one has been able to reach the 100th floor and live. This had always been the same for them, and no one had ever replaced their God.

"Even on a planet off in the distance like this one, they have a hierarchy. I guess things don't change no matter where you are..."Quinn thought.

"Then, why did Geo not choose to become a Tower guard and live in the tower, If life is so much better there?" Quinn asked.

"We're not sure," Gina replied.

"All we know is he took the test with another person from this neighbourhood. It was Geo's best friend, Nock. In the end, Nock became part of the tower guard while Geo returned to us."

"Maybe it would be best to ask Geo himself. Perhaps he knows something about the tower that the others don't since he has entered it before."

"What I am concerned about is the amount of celestial energy I can feel. It's a lot, just too much. Which makes me wonder what condition he has that he's been fulfilling." Quinn thought.

The match had started again. And Quinn continued to be the amazing goalkeeper he was, but it was short-lived, as the food was finally ready. Geo called everyone over, and they all started to dig in, including all the hungry little kids.

From what he had learnt, the Amra people had to hunt their own food and feast on the beasts that lived here. Which was something that humans weren't able to do—something about the energy in their body.

In fact, shortly after the humans removed a crystal from the beast, the body would deteriorate quickly unless a forger did something to preserve it quickly.

Quinn didn't feel quite hungry, so instead, he decided to use this time to climb up and try to get a full scope of the city and sense if any of these guards had celestial energy. Meanwhile, the others continued to eat the good food.

"So, did you guys have fun with Quinn? You didn't play too rough with him, I hope." Geo asked.

"What rough? Quinn was amazing; we have never seen someone so strong before!" One of them answered.

"Oh." An older woman raised an eyebrow. "I guess you can bother someone else to be the goalkeeper for both Gina and Solace then."

"Haha, I doubt that." Geo laughed.

"Both Gina and Solace are soccer prodigies. I can only take a few shots from them before my arms start to give up. Their ball becomes a weapon from their kicks."

Both Gina and Solace looked at each other at that moment.

"How long were we playing for?"

"About an hour." Another adult replied.

Thinking about it, the two knew that Geo wasn't joking. He really did have to stop being in goal for their shots after around half an hour. Geo was also the only person at whom they could kick the ball with full strength, but with Quinn, they hadn't held back either.

It seemed like none of the other kids had realised this, but the two of them did, and as they looked at Quinn on top of the roof, shivers started to run down their rocky backs as they thought about just how strong this stranger was.

"Hmm... that Tower... l wonder..." Quinn thought.

***

# Chapter 1728: All Answers!

"Thanks for playing with the kids. They seemed very satisfied after you played along with them. I hope they didn't go overboard with their pranks. These kids can be a bit too much sometimes."

Geo said as the two of them walked out of the small neighbourhood-like village and headed into the city to another location, where Quinn might have the answer to his questions.

"It's okay, I managed to learn a lot from them, and they seemed like good kids," Quinn replied.

"I learned a bit about the Tower too, and I can't deny that I am quite curious about it. They told me all the great things about the Tower and how their life would have been different if they were there."

"They even said you got up to the tenth level, if you don't mind, would you tell me why you didn't become a Tower guard?"

Since Geo was helping him, Quinn thought if there was any way to help Geo within his ability, he would gladly help him. After all, that's just how Quinn was.

"The Tower, huh," Geo softly spoke as if deep in thought and eventually began to answer.

"The Tower is a dream for many of the Amra raceIn fact, I don't know a single person whose dream isn't to one day enter the Tower."

"However, not everyone has the strength to enter, and many of those that couldn't make it past the first floor know that. Because of the Tower, I believe our race can't evolve past what it currently is."

"Everyone acts extremely selfish. All with the goal of improving their life, they have forgotten about the others around them, and it was the same for my best friend, Nock."

"The two of us were orphaned after our parents died trying to enter the Tower."

"However, our neighbourhood took us in and looked after us. They fed us, and helped us stand on our feet."

"Since then, the two of us had been training, fighting beasts on the outside and doing all sorts of work, all to become a part of the Tower and accomplish what our parents failed to do and make their dream a reality."

"The Tower was one of the most difficult things that the two of us did, and I think if we didn't have each other's back on each floor, perhaps we would have never made it to the Tenth floor."

"However, we did it, but you see, there are certain rules for those in the Tower."

"One is the most well-known rule that states that the people who successfully reach the tenth floor can invite their family to the Tower, to live with them."

"You know, I was fighting for those who raised me and brought me up, but after reaching the Tenth floor, I was devastated when I found out that the Tower didn't consider the neighbourhood as my family."

"So in the end, I made my choice. Some may think I'm crazy, but I know that there are those that eventually leave the Tower."

"You see, those that enter the Tower, including the guards, are always striving for more. They wish to get better and stronger, to climb the floors and reach a higher position."

"I find that there is always something above you, and if you are always comparing yourself to those above, you can never be happy with what you got."

"So I have chosen a simpler life that may not be for everyone, but seeing everyone in my neighbourhood, the smile on their faces, is enough for me."

It was a touching tale, but judging by the fact that Quinn had heard of no one going by the name Nock in the neighbourhood they were in and from what the kids were saying before. It seemed like Geo's friend didn't think the same way and had chosen Tower life.

It was a shame, but honestly, with the way Quinn was, he didn't think he could live the same way as Geo, to be satisfied with what he had. In fact, everything he had done was always for a better future, a better tomorrow for him, his friends and his family.

In a way, both Geo and Quinn were similar, but they were also stark opposites of each other at the same time. So while both of their goals were somewhat alike, their approach was different.

Eventually, it looked like Geo had brought Quinn to a shopping district, and down an alleyway, there was a sign for a weapons shop. Upon entering the shop, Quinn noticed that most of the items looked similar to the weapons that humans would use.

Although a few things looked more suited for this planet, like the certain weapons, which needed their four hands to hold them properly. Most of the items were dusty as they hung on the wall, but they weren't all weapons. There looked to be other gadgets as well.

"I got excited there for a second, but then I saw it's you. Did you break the knuckle protectors I gave you?"

"You know I can't just keep repairing them for free for you, you're going to have to pay me free for you, you're going to have to pay me somehow?"

The voice had come from an old man behind the counter. He had deep wrinkles on his face, but his body looked just as large, fit and functioning as the other Amra. It was also hard to judge the man's age if it wasn't for the wrinkles.

Finally, the old man looked up from his counter and laid his eyes on Quinn. Then, adjusting his strange monocle spectacle, he started to twist and turn it, allowing him to get a closer look at Quinn.

"Are you... An alien?" The old man asked.

"Um, yes, I am not from here, and it's actually why Geo introduced me to you, sir."

"I was wondering, do you know of a planet called Earth, and if so, is there a way for me to get there somehow?" Quinn asked.

The excitement in the man's eyes lit up, and he jumped over the counter using two of his arms, landing on the ground.

"You are from a different place? Another planet? Your planet must not have as many troubles as ours based on your mass and size"

"To be able to create such weak things after all this time." The old man was rambling. "Please, what is your technology like? Tell me about your home."

Seeing this, Geo couldn't help but laugh.

"Quinn, this is Dober. He also used to be a part of the tower, but he gave up climbing a long time ago and instead set his sights on what was outside and around the world. There aren't many creators or blacksmiths like him on the city level. At least not good ones like Dober here. I'm hoping that he can help you in your journey."

It looked like Geo was getting ready to leave as he lifted the ragged curtain that blocked the doorway.

"Where are you going, Geo? I haven't thanked you yet," Quinn asked.

"My people need me, I caught lunch, but I must go out and catch more beasts for dinner now. Dober is a good man, and if he can't help you, then no one can."

"Besides, he likes to ramble when he is excited, and I'm sure he has many questions for you. Who knows, you might even still be talking to him by the time I get back." Geo smiled.

"You know where I will be if you need me again." Then glancing at Dober, he added, "Look after him!!!"

With that, Geo was gone before Quinn really could do anything for him. Still, Dober seemed more than interested in Quinn and, as Geo said, was asking him questions nonstop. Nearly all of them were about the technology that humans had.

The thing was, Quinn wasn't really the right person to explain this stuff. He knew a few things from Vincent and Logan but not enough to detail how they worked to help out Dober.

Finally, after Dober was content with the answers, Quinn could ask for his request.

"Ah yes, so you are looking for a ship that will be able to fly into space or a communication device of some kind?" Dober repeated.

"Well, I'll be honest, there are a few problems with that. First, if we can create a spaceship, I doubt anyone knows where Earth is."

"However, the first problem will be the spaceship itself. Yes, we have created ships, but they are located inside the tower for important personnel."

"I have most of the parts from collecting scrap over the years, but some of the main components to make it work are stored in the tower."

"Since I'm an ex-member of the tower, I could go tomorrow and head to the tenth floor to ask if anyone has those parts, but I don't have the funds to pay for them. Still, it will be the first step."

"Go to the tower? Is there any chance that I can come with you?" Quinn asked.

Dober's eyes went wide when he heard the question.

"Since you have never been in the tower before, you are not allowed up to the tenth floor, you would have to start from the first floor, and I'm afraid that would be the death of you, young one."

# Chapter 1729: An Old Friend.

Before heading outside of the city to go for another hunt or a fishing trip, Geo wanted to stop by the neighbourhood to gather some of his more specialised weapons. He felt that this hunt would go well after how the whole day was going so great today.

"That Quinn sure is a great guy. If he's going to be here for a while, maybe I should invite him out for a hunt sometime. It would be nice to have a new companion." Geo said, smiling to himself.

However, upon returning to the village, he noticed the Tower Guards gathered there, and seeing this, his heart skipped a beat.

"What are they doing here?" He thought.

There was a squad of guards of about ten Tower Guards, with one squad leader. The guards wore beast armour on their bodies, which were all similarly styled in a bold dark blue colour, and also wore specially made helmets that would mainly cover the top of their head, but the rest of their faces were visible.

The guards had looked to have gathered everyone on the street, including the kids, rounding them up for some reason.

"What is going on here," Geo asked, a little annoyed.

The guards weren't the friendliest of people. Sure, there would be good ones now and then, but they seemed to think of themselves as better than others because they knew that others couldn't stand up to them.

It was then that the squad leader turned around.

"Don't worry. We were just given a special task to do, and I thought I would stop by to meet you all again." The leader stated, with a large smile on his face.

Geo paused for a second but soon realised who it was.

"Nock, you finally came to visit us after all this time," Geo said as he walked forward to greet his old friend.

Suddenly, the other guards standing silently moved to block the way between the two.

"You are not allowed to approach the squad leader!" The guard voiced and threw out his fist.

As it came towards Geo, he avoided two of the punches and pushed them out of the way, throwing the guard slightly off balance.

"Calm down, everyone. This is an old friend, and he means no harm." Nock explained. "Without him, I might not have even been in the position I am today."

Hearing these words brought back memories of when the two of them had cleared up to the tenth floor together, but it had been quite a few years since that happened, and since then, it was the first time that Nock had returned.

"So, is there anything we can help you with, Nock? What brings the guards here in the first place." Geo asked.

"Well, the guards have been asked to search the city to see if there is anyone suspicious. We haven't really been given much information other than that."

"As I said, I decided to come here because I wanted to see everyone again, especially you." Nock whispered the last bit.

"It looks like you have been keeping up in shape, and your reactions haven't slowed. How about a little spar for old times' sake. I never could beat you, but I have been training a lot since entering the tower." Nock asked.

Geo looked a little hesitant. The look on the others' faces didn't exactly feel like Nock had gathered them in a welcoming way. He could see the fear in these people as they eyed Nock and the other Tower Guards.

"The Nock that I knew and the one living in the tower for a while might not be the same." Geo thought, which was why he chose to be careful with his words.

"We all know it is a crime to fight against a Tower Guard. So we don't want to invite 'trouble' here." Geo smiled.

"It will be okay. Those guys don't come unless one of us calls for them in the first place anyway. I promise I'm the one that asked for this sparring match."

"Do you think I would then report you if you hurt me? I just want to fight again, for old times sake."

It looked like Nock was hemg pushy, and Geo did think about it a bit more. The two of them did use to spar all the time with no proffemus or questions asked. Perhaps he was just being too cautious for no reason.

"Alright, but remember what you said." Geo smiled.

The area where the kids would usually play football was similar to an arena. At the same time, people from the neighbourhood, including those from a few streets away, had decided to come and watch. The other Tower guard members stood by the sidelines, stopping others from entering and getting too close to the two in the arena.

It was quite exciting for a lot of them. Because it was very rare to witness a Tower Guard fight. There weren't many that would be stupid enough to go against Tower Guards or have the strength to spar with them. Thus, most of the Guards sparred or fought in the Tower.

The match started, and Nock ran from his position, pushing ahead firmly straight towards Geo. He steeled both his arms on his right side and threw them out as hard as he could.

Seeing this, Geo carefully raised his arms, blocking his side and ribs. Still Nock didn't stop there as he decided to barrage his enemy, throwing out the other two arms, yet Geo still was able to block them.

Geo continued to block. The swings came left and right, and loud bangs would echo throughout the arena after each hit.

"You might have been able to block my attacks forever in the past, but my strength has improved!" Nock claimed, laughing as he continued to attack and changed his attack pattern.

Instead of swinging both his arms, he now was firing them out one after another and had gotten through, hitting Geo's pecs and rigid body.

"Your punches are stronger, but I thought you said you had improved; you're still just relying on the same strength!" Geo said.

At the right time, using two of his arms, Geo had grabbed two of them. The other two arms had hit Geo right in the chest, but he didn't care because he had readied up an attack of his own. Raising his fists in the air, he slammed them down towards the two he had held on to.

Not letting go, Geo had used quite a bit of force, and in doing so, a few fracture marks like that on a rock could be seen appearing on Nock's skin. Trying to shake it off and using the rage inside him, Nock charged forward again while grunting.

"How?! How can you still be this far ahead of me!" Nock threw out a double punch with two of his fists on one side again but fell short of Geo.

This was done on purpose as he allowed the momentum of his attack to spin his body, and now with his other arms, he was planning to hit a spinning back fist.

While mid-spin, before Nick could hit Geo, he felt a heavy foot on him push him back. It pushed him just enough so both of his fists had hit nothing but the air.

"What are you doing, Nock?" Geo asked. That hit, you used a lot of strength in that, a spinning back fist; if that hit me on the head, it would be more than just a shallow wound."

Nock looked around at the others that were looking at him. When looking at them, he could see smiles and hear a few laughs from those in the crowd. "Geo, you were the one that started it. Look at my arms! You nearly broke them," Nock shouted back.

"I let go, so I didn't break them. Look, I don't want to argue, and I don't want us to hurt each other. We're not kids anymore. This spar is over." Geo said as he turned his back and walked towards the villagers.

"Geo's the best, Geo's amazing! He took on a tower Guard!" The kids said in excitement. Hearing these words, Nock gritted his teeth.

"Tower guards, a Tower captain has been attacked," Nock shouted. "Under Section 4 Rule 23, capture and punish the criminal!"
