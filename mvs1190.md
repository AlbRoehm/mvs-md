# Chapter 1194 Another war

Every time the giant Cursed ship would be hit by the beast lasers, different parts of the ship would rumble slightly. However, Logan was doing a great job blocking the attacks.

Although the Cursed faction had plenty of crystals on board for situations such as this one, they never wanted nor expected to get into a battle where it would be down to who had more crystals on board. Without knowing the enemy that was a bad road to go down.

At the moment, using his ability and his eyesight, Logan was concentrating immensely to use the absolute minimum amount of crystals possible. Each time an attack was about to hit a certain part, he would be sure just to activate the shield in that area.

"Why is a non-Dalki ship attacking us?!" Megan screamed looking for an answer but Sam had no clue what was going on, and from the looks of it neither did most of the others in the command centre.

"No, they’re here, now!" Sil said, almost pulling out of his hair.

"Snap out of it kid, you knew this day would come!" Raten shouted.

"It’s the Blade family!" Vorden eventually explained to the others. "I’ve seen that ship before, back on the island it belongs to Hilston!"

A day that a lot of them had expected to come at some point, they all knew the reasons for why they had come. It was, either to exact revenge against Quinn and Arthur, or to get Sil back. The only thing was, Quinn wasn’t here to help them this time.

"The Blades, why now of all times?!" Sam banged his fist on the table. "Is he really that selfish? The whole world is in a crisis and they are still thinking about their own agenda. Is Hilston really that arrogant that he thinks there is no one in the world that can stop him even after being defeated!"

What was more worrying were the little battleships that were heading their way. After Quinn’s last visit to their island, most of their personnel should have been dealt with, so just who were the ones currently piloting those ships?

’As long as he isn’t dealt with, we won’t be able to send support to the other groups. I have to inform them immediately about what’s going on with the Curse ship right now.’ Quickly, Sam recorded a voice message that was sent out to both Owen, and Sach.

"Urgent report, the Cursed faction ship is currently facing its own trouble. Hilston Blade is attacking us. I repeat, Hilston Blade is attacking us!" Sam shouted down the receiver.

It was enough for the others to fully understand how dangerous the situation the Cursed faction was facing and after Sach and Owen had received the message, they worried that maybe the Cursed faction would soon be the one needing the help.

When sending the message out, there was one more person Sam hesitated to ask for help, and that was Quinn.

’If I ask him to come here, and help us. Would he abandon all of those on the Cursed planets to fight against Hilston. If I do that, then there is a good chance that many lives will be lost. The other question is whether we can even deal with Hilston on our own...but I’m not the Cursed leader. Is it selfish of me to make this decision on my own?’ Sam hesitated at the moment.

By now, everyone had already left the room, apart from Logan who was controlling the main ship. Because they knew they had a tough battle ahead of them.

——

Inside the ship, Bonny and Void were busy conducting their interviews with those in the Cursed. Specifically ones that had recently been out on missions. As they wanted to know what their experience was when dealing with those from other factions.

The red alert had been signalled but the reporters were unaware of what the emergency call exactly was, but news spread fast and soon the worries on everyone’s faces could be seen.

’A full out war, and they’re attacking all three groups at once. I guess since the Cursed ship is constantly in orbit and doesn’t have a home planet it settles on, it could technically decide to help any of the groups. Although the most likely choice is to help out their own people.’ Bonny thought.

At the moment, she wished she was at one of the other planets, and at the same time didn’t. Perhaps it was a sign telling her that she should avoid such a confrontation if she wanted to live.

Instead, all she could do was continue interviewing people and ask them what they thought of the situation, although they were unsurprisingly far less willing to waste any time right now.

"Void, go live." Bonny told her associate.

"We won’t be able to edit anything out in that case." Void cautioned her, yet Bonny didn’t care and pressed the button to go live herself. As a professional her cameraman shut up and continued to roll.

"I’m sure by now everyone has received the news about the Dalki attacks. I’m Reporter Bonny, currently recording live from the Cursed faction ship, where worries of their families and loved ones are high, I’m sure just like all of you watching too."

The live broadcast wouldn’t be viewed by those doing battle, they were unable to, but this was more aimed at the families who were worried about their loved ones currently doing their part to protect them.

Bonny and Void filmed the soldiers that were soon going to go into battle. They didn’t bother them as they were preparing, asking Nathan for a few words for the viewers. Everyone was surprised to hear that he and his group were going off to help those in the Earthborn group.

The comments were positive, all supporting them and wishing them good luck in the battle.

As they walked through the main hall of the Cursed ship, suddenly a loud explosion came from their side. The heat could be felt on Bonny and Void’s faces. When turning around, they could see the front half of a small ship had managed to pierce the large faction ship, it’s front nose damaged and slightly bent.

Nearly instantly as well, small little spiders surfaced around the damaged part of the ship, and the little robots were proceeding to repair it as quickly as possible, in order to equalise the pressure inside the place.

It looked like Logan was on top of things, using his soul weapon.

’How did the ship get past my defences and attacks, it was moving a lot faster than the others. Was that an ability?’ Logan thought.

However, the hatch to the ship had opened, and out came a frail human who had dark bags on his eyes, and hardly any clothing or beast gear. A crowd from the Cursed had gathered around, trying to figure out what was going on.

"It’s a human." They said surprised.

"I know we were being attacked but I thought it might have been a Dalki with all that was going on. Do you think that they could be V?" Another said.

[Alert, this is a message from the Cursed faction Vice leader. We are currently being attacked by a group of people from the Blade family. They are intruders, with powerful abilities and are a threat!]

Hearing this, those from the Cursed stepped back and drew their weapons. However, it was hard for a lot of them to attack someone, when they hadn’t been attacked yet, but that soon changed, as the person lifted his hand, to reveal the floating daggers on each side.

Then tapping all of them, they started to shoot off like a bullet, straight at all of the members around them.

’The Cursed faction are being attacked by the Blades!.’ Bonny thought trying to make sense of it all, and the tone coming from Sam didn’t make it sound exactly safe either. ’I’m starting to think that maybe trouble comes wherever we are.’

"Freedom...I will earn my freedom!" The man cried out like a maniac, as he ran towards one of the Cursed members that had fallen from his initial attack. Lifting the Cursed member’s sword, he intended to use his powers to increase the velocity of any item. He soon tapped the back of the sword and saw it spinning off again towards the reporter and the others.

Before it could reach, a shadow raised up in front of them, and when it fell to the ground, the sword had been grabbed by someone. The next second, he started to infuse the sword with Qi, and quickly threw it back, stabbing the invader directly in the chest, causing him to fall to the floor.

"Don’t show the intruders any mercy!" Nate shouted. "You’ve seen it, they’re here to kill us all!"

Behind him, were fifty well trained members of the Cursed faction all adapted to Qi training.

"Void, are you getting all of this? We need to keep filming. The situation is getting hectic!" Bonny shouted, as the two of them ran for cover, trying to find a safer place to film from. Zooming in with his camera, that’s when Void could see a strange deceive that had been dropped by the ship. However he soon recognised it, and a few seconds later, it had created a portal, activating on the spot.

Seconds later, and multiple strong ability users could be seen storming into the Cursed ship, all eager to regain their freedom.

*****

# Chapter 1195 The family reunited

It took an immense amount of concentration for Logan to prevent the Cursed faction ship from being blasted out of existence while also keeping the small ships from boarding onto their ship. Nevertheless, one of them had managed to slip through his defenses, by suddenly accelerating at a speed he had failed to foresee amidst his multitasking.

Although they had weapons and small ships of their own, Sam had ordered all of them to stay inside. Their group simply was not suited for space combat, so their best chance at survival was for them to stay inside, especially to deal with any invaders like they had to now.

"I need help protecting the vital area of the ship!" Logan used the intercom to make the announcement for everyone to hear. "I can protect us, but without help I don’t know for how long."

Logan had to rely on the others to do their part. He had to hope that the inside wasn’t too hectic from the one invader ship that had breached them. He was already using his soul weapon, to repair the ship as best as he could, simultaneously taking control of the turrets on the outside, to fire at any other ships that might surprise him.

Soon though Logan could see a huge problem. Using his powers, his soul weapon he needed beast crystals but everyone was busy doing their own thing. On top of that, for some reason, no one was refueling the beast crystals to power the weapons on board.

’Did something happen inside? The battle hasn’t been going out for that long, it should be impossible for us to have already run out of crystals! I’ll have to switch to just protecting our front to hold them off for a little longer, but someone needs to investigate ASAP.’

Just as Logan thought this, five more ships managed to bypass his defenses going straight to the back of the Cursed ship, spinning, avoiding the lazers. One of them had been hit on the wing but had crashed on top of the Cursed ship itself. The other four were heading towards the thrusters of their ship. They flew close to the outside layer, making it hard for the lasers to reach them.

Feeling safe, the pilot of the front ship didn’t even register the large sword until it had already sliced his vehicle in half. The one behind it barely managed to evade the energy blast that had been fired off next.

"WOOHOO! I’ll have to thank Longblade and Avion after we survive this! Didn’t think I’d get to use this thing so soon, and this one’s a lot better than the one I used in the tunnels last time!" Fex exclaimed, as his Mech ran towards the other ships with the sword in his hand.

After Logan’s distress call, the vampire had rightfully believed that it would be his time to shine.

——

In the main hall where the first ship had breached the Cursed faction ship, the fighting had turned intense. Although the first enemy had been defeated, out of the portable portal around twenty more had come out, all in similar condition to the first man.

Believing that he and his trained men should be able to handle them, Nate had ordered for the regular members of the Cursed faction to get out and do their best to get to safety, something the non-combatants had gladly complied with. Nate was one of the more trustworthy leaders of the faction on the ship, whose strength was universally recognised since he had taught so many of them.

’We outnumber them nearly three-to-one and it looks like they hardly have any energy to run! This should be doable!’ Nate thought as he stepped forward and blasted a Qi powered fist into one of the invaders at the front.

Alas, the next moment he was seen sliding across the floor, albeit hardly hurt. If anything he was confused how his attack could have so little effect.

’What’s going on? The combination of my vampire strength and Qi powers are barely enough to move him?!’

Looking at the man in front of him more closely he could see that his stomach had been hardened. It looked nearly identical to the skill that Nate had learned in the past.

’That ability of hardening, it looks like it’s stronger than when I used it, but I don’t even recognise this person. How could an unknown be this strong?’

Although the Cursed faction did indeed have more people on their side, it didn’t take long for them to come to the realisation that looks could be deceiving. Despite their shabby outer appearance the invaders all proved why they had once been considered to be the strongest ability users in the world and why the Blades had bothered to kidnap them.

The hardened one, now aware that he could take Nate’s hit without a problem, charged forward once again. When he saw a black sword come swinging at him, he just grinned. Concentrating his hardening ability towards his stomach he felt himself safe, at least until the blade connected and sliced through his body as if it was butter.

A grunt was heard and a large female with horns sticking out from her hair could be seen.

"Layla, what the.... How?! No, when did you get so strong?!" Nate questioned seeing her in her second form, still baffled with how much ease the girl had taken care of the enemy. He had closely paid attention to her during her training before the fight with Helen and he was sure he wasn’t that powerfult at the time. What exactly had happened in the relatively short time he hadn’t seen her?

"Thanks for the praise, but it’s actually just this sword that’s a bit special. I’ll tell you more once we’ve dealt with them."

A small group of Chained were protecting the teleporter, making it impossible for the Cursed faction members to get close. Seeing this, Layla was planning to get rid of them as quickly as possible, but the teleporter activated once again.

"No, is that, it can’t be!" Bonny exclaimed with her eyes lighting up large. The two of them had managed to hide in one of the hallways behind a broken door. It was stuck partially out, so they could continue to film while remaining relatively safe.

Still, the identity of the person came as such a shock that Void nearly dropped his camera.

The large bellied man slammed his two fist together, and flames started to run up and down his arms. "I will be free!" The man proclaimed and those near him repeated it, as if a chant.

Just like all the others he wasn’t any ordinary person, yet the man was special even among the other Chained. After all, he used to be one of the Big Four, Burnie Sunshield. He had gone missing, everyone had long since presumed him dead.

"Layla! It looks like me and you are going to have to take that balloon down!" Nate shouted, slamming his fist together and activating the hardening skill over his hands. Qi wasn’t the only thing he had trained while the others had been away.

———

Elsewhere on the ship, one of the Chained who had walked through the portal had done so while using her invisibility ability. Just as instructed, once she found what she perceived as a safe place away from the eyes of others, she placed down another portable teleporter.

The place she chose, ended up being one of the canteens that were currently empty. More specifically, she had placed it in the kitchen area. Upon its activation four people stepped out of it. A mostly blonde haired man with some grey by the sides of his head in a full set of beast armour, a blonde haired woman, and a pair of blonde twins.

—————

Vorden, Sil, Raten, Shiro, Peter and Borden were currently in the room with the Blade kids. None of them intended to go out, the kids being their clear top priority. Unfortunately there was no good place for them to hide on the ship, so the only thing they could do was attempt to border up and stay in one of the classrooms.

"Did you guys manage to copy abilities off each other yet?" Vorden asked as the children continued to touch each other’s hands sharing their ability. Some of them had brave faces on, while others worried.

As for Sil, right now Shiro was still busy trying to boost his friend’s confidence. His body was no longer visibly shaking, yet this was mainly for the sake of his siblings. He understood that if he continued to act like he had before, then it would make them worry even more and Sil couldn’t do that to them.

"Guys, do you remember how you all felt in that damn temple? Because I remember that suffocating feeling every single day! If we don’t fight now, they will force us to return to that miserable life. I don’t know about you, but I want none of that crap!" Raten shouted, getting his blades ready and not a moment too soon.

The doors to the room were aggressively flung open, removing them from their hinges and swinging outward, but little Borden was able to jump up and grab them making sure they didn’t harm the students.

"Brother Sil, you left us a nice surprise last time. I hope you can come back to us without putting up much of a struggle. We don’t want to hurt you, after all." Vicky said with a sadistic smile on her face, while her twin brother Pai just harrumphed.

"How dare you bully our little brother?" Vorden asked aggressively. "Tell her, what do we do with those that try to hurt Sil?"

"We pull their limbs apart!" Raten shouted.

The twins were taken aback by this, nobody had told them anything about the Cursed faction having humanoid beasts. Not only that, since when could those talk and since one was Sil related to them?

"Peter, Borden, take the kids someplace else, otherwise they might get hurt. We will deal with those two." Vorden ordered. "Sil, save your strength until you see him. Trust the others, they are strong enough to help you!"

Peter and Borden clenched their fists and threw out a punch at the classroom wall, breaking through it. Looking back, Sil was wondering if the two of them would be okay, but he had other problems to worry about.

—————

Back in the canteen the portal flickered once more, and a large man in diamond armour stepped out.

# Chapter 1196 Not just one

In the main hall of the ship, those that had learned Qi alongside Nate were busy fighting against the Chained that had come through the portal. They were all thankful for having learned the skill, because without it, they would have been seriously hurt and out of the fight by now.

The strong ability users were able to hurt them, but through the power of Qi, they had managed to reinforce their bodies, lessening the blows that they would receive, in turn using attacks of their own. Of course, on top of that, they also had their own abilities as well.

The problem was, the two groups had been at quite the stalemate, but that was about to change with Burnie Sunshield appearing. He had been hailed as one of the strongest fire users in existence. In almost an instant everyone there had recognised who he was.

——

"For those who don’t recognise him, the one who has just come out should be Burnie Sunshield, he was one of the Big Four that had gone missing during the Civil War. The Sunshield family had been annihilated and no one knew by whom." Bonny reported. "It looks like today we finally got an answer to that. Although they had never been part of it, the Blade family had power rivaling any of the former Big Four, and the Cursed faction are doing everything they can to survive."

The whole world probably was confused by the situation happening at the moment. Only select families knew about the Blade family’s existence, but it was not something the general populace had been aware of. After what Bonny had witnessed last time she had known a few details and it was her job to report accurately on everything that was going on.

That’s when Bonny heard a large bang, coming from another direction of the ship. It sounded far off in the distance.

’Have they managed to infiltrate other places as well?’ Looking around, she could see that there was no sign of the boy they called Sil. It didn’t take much to figure out that the link the Blade family and the Cursed faction shared was due to this person.

"How many drones do you have?" Bonny asked her associate.

"I have four altogether, not counting the camera I’m holding." Void answered.

"Let’s spread them out around the Cursed ship, see if we can find out anything else that is going on. Since we’re already here it’s our solemn duty to show the Cursed faction’s valiant struggles!" Bonny ordered and soon, the drones started to fly up higher, avoiding getting hit as they went around the ship.

——

Burnie’s arms were covered in flames that were constantly spinning like small tornadoes and it didn’t take long for him to figure out which ones would be the best to take out first. Jumping off his short, large legs, a few sparks of flames were left behind and now coming down upon both of them, Burnie was aiming to finish them off with one hit.

Swinging her sword out, Layla was ready to slash right through the flames and bring down Burnie. At the same time, Nate gathered his strength, and threw out his hardened blood fist. However that wasn’t the only thing he had done, before the flames could reach him, the shadow extended from his fist and wrapped around the flames, dwindling them.

’This ability....’ Burnie remembered that he had seen it once before. Still, from his elbows, the fire grew larger and strengthened his fist moving it forward with great speed and both of them slammed into the two from the Cursed faction.

Layla’s blade had managed to get rid of the flames directly touching the sword, but she still felt them go past her hair and face slightly, burning the surface of her skin.

’What are his hands made of if my blade can’t cut through?’ Layla was surprised, but could see that Burnie had something similar to brass knuckles on his hand. If her blade wasn’t able to cut through it, it meant he had to have similar strength to her.

Even though the black blade had been able to negate the flames, the strength behind the punch had still sent her back quite a bit, tumbling on the floor. As she rolled on the ground, she was quick to get back up.

’Third form!’ The bottom half of her body changed to a serpent, and soon she spat the green fire on her burns by her face and sides. Slithering on the ground, she could get to Burnie quicker. Because Nate had managed to match Burnie’s strength, he was still in the same position as before.

"Haha, I never thought in my dreams I would get to the point where I could match the strength of one of the Big Four, but here I am!" Nate shouted to hype himself up, both hands held out. He had used all his Qi in his body and his shadow ability to lessen the speed of the flames and the flame man’s punch, while the blood hardening protected the outside of his hands.

Both of his legs had sunken deep into the ground, to the point where the flooring panels had been lifted out. The only problem was, he no longer had his shadow to use. Blocking those flames had exhausted nearly all of his MC cells.

Fortunately, he wasn’t fighting alone. Layla appeared behind Sunshield, sure that her flame attacks would be useless against him, she decided to swing the blade towards Burnie’s back.

"Your weapon seems to be able to block my flames, but it can’t block them all!" Burnie grunted, and slammed his foot on the ground. Heat was steaming from his nostrils and in an instant. Fire shot out from his back like a rocket. From the outside he looked like a flaming hedgehog.

The only thing Layla could do was place the sword near her to block most of the flames and cover her body with Qi, but still she was sent back and rolled onto the ground once more, reverting back to her first form.

’We can’t beat him, he’s too strong. I’ll have to take on that form again!’’ Seeing as her friend was struggling, that seemed like the only choice. Layla tried to think back to the fight against Agent 2 and all the hurtful things he had said... but her mind was going blank.

’What’s wrong, why...why can’t I visualise it like I used to?’

"You with the strange red hands." Burnie said, as he grabbed Nate’s fist with his free hand and pulled it apart. Soon, he grabbed the other fist as well. Now the vampire could feel it, that the temperature was rising in both of his hands.

"Arghh!" Nate started to scream, even with the blood hardening, and his Qi, the power was too much for him to handle. It was clear that Burnie hadn’t been one of the Big Four just for show. The fire ability user overpowered the vampire with just his ability alone, but was almost toying with him.

’What is this crap, I can’t just watch as someone dies in front of me, just because I can’t get over my freaking mommy issues!’ Layla was screaming in her head. She could see the negative feeling all around in the room, but still as if a mental block was put on her, she was afraid of absorbing them and turning into that thing again.

Seeing Nate suffer like this, she decided that there was one thing she had to try. She had already tested it on weapons before, but had never attempted to use her powers on a living being.

’I don’t know if this will affect me in any way, but I can’t just let Nate die!’ Layla put on a determined expression as she held out both of her hands toward Nate, and concentrated. It was at that moment that Nate started to feel something aside from the rising temperature. The power in his body was starting to swell. It felt similar to his power, yet slightly different.

’Is this Qi? Just how much power is this?’ Turning his head slightly, he could see from the corner of his eye that Layla was on the floor stretching her hand out. This had to be her doing somehow.

Layla had an abnormally large amount of Qi. Not only her own, but her mother had given her powers that had been cultivated over the years. However, Layla’s body couldn’t handle the enormous strength of power without going to the fourth form.

Still, there was something else she had subconsciously learned to do. Through her telekinesis powers she had been able to infuse items with Qi. She had done so when fighting against Agent 11, powering the broken sword with Qi, to stab through his foot.

Right now, she was doing the same, using her telekinesis powers she was transferring her Qi to Nate. Unlike her, he had a strong trained body in martial arts and was a natural vampire rather than a subclass. Nevertheless, she was worried about the aftereffects this would have on both of them.

Agent 2 had been proof that too much could lead to disastrous effects, but she couldn’t hold back too much either.

Pouring the Qi in his hands, and using the blood hardening he had learned, the pain started to lessen.

"Oi, you pompous piece of flaming crap, you’ve always been the least favourite of the four for me. You always were too hot headed!" Nate shouted as he quickly broke free from Burnie’s grip and grabbed the hands himself. The power was a little too much for Nate to handle and his hands felt like they were going to explode if he allowed it to accumulate anymore.

"If all you can do is hold on to me, then this is useless!" Burnie shouted back as he was ready to push forward once more, until shadows rose up and covered both the hands of Burnie once more. However, these shadow’s didn’t belong to Nate.

"Unlike you and your old bullshit system our Cursed faction doesn’t rely on the strength of just one person!" Dennis shouted, from behind and slammed the black sword he had picked up, through Burnie’s neck. Quickly jumping out of the way, Dennis was expecting a flame attack, but while doing so he threw out a blood swipe and another blood swipe from another direction had come out, hitting the back of the sword pushing it even further inside.

Dennis, had arrived not on his own, but with Megan as back up as well as with Sam. Dennis and Sam both had a strange blue glows on them, courtesy of Layla’s supportive powers.

"How...I was one of the strongest ability users out there...I thought there was only one person who could beat me...how could I have lost just to four nobodies...." Burnie questioned reality, as his breath was dwindling.

"A lot has changed since you have been away. I guess there’s just a lot of strong people now." Nate answered.

Burnie had been defeated, but the fighting was continuing in the ship. Layla had exhausted all of her powers once again, unable to move from the ground, she nevertheless had a smile on her face, for not letting Nate die. Still, it seemed like this time her abnormal Qi had even affected Nate, since he had almost collapsed to the floor instantly as well.

"Megan, Sam we have to get them out of here, and get rid of the rest!" Dennis shouted.

Sam, seeing how much trouble everyone was in, and knowing what the Blades were like, had predicted this. Their shadow powers were strong but it took a toll on them. If someone else as powerful as Burnie would appear, there was no guarantee they could beat them now.

There was no time for rest, but the world due to Bonny and Void had just witnessed something unbelievable happen. Something beyond their understanding, and it looked like there was more to come, as the drone had entered a training room, where two humanoid beasts were facing off against the Blade family twins.

*****

# Chapter 1197 Three Sils

The livestream had shown everything. The reveal of one of the Big Four working with the mysterious Blade family, and as quick as they learned of his existence, they quickly all witnessed his demise as well.

During the time the video was playing, Bonny did her best to inform everyone of who the Blade family really were. A secret family that had ruled the Big Four behind the scenes, the strongest ability users in existence.

After witnessing everything so far, comments were coming in faster than ever under the video.

"Do you really believe that there was this Blade family behind the Big Four?"

"They had the missing Burnie, so it has to be true. Maybe they have Mona as well. Besides, if it wasn’t true this video would have been taken down."

"Well, who is there to take it down, you have to remember that there is a war going on at the moment."

"Was Burnie always that weak? Maybe he wasn’t all that. Did you see how the Cursed members banded to beat him. Maybe that’s how he was easily captured."

"My family has fought against the Sunshield, trust me their power is not exaggerated. If Burnie could have, he would have been able to destroy the whole ship with his flames, but why didn’t they do that?"

There were a couple of things that had led to Burnie Sunshield’s demise. One of them was the fact that he was unaware of their shadow ability and the strange black sword. Both of these things had been able to suppress the power of the flames that would have otherwise killed the others in an instant.

On top of that, any large scale attacks there was a worry that the ship would be destroyed, but their goal wasn’t to destroy the ship, it was to find a certain someone.

"Those other ability users. I recognise some of them. Isn’t that Danny Wang, the famous wind user who went missing."

"Yeah, now that I take a closer look I recognise a few of the others as well, they all went missing at some point in time."

The reason why Sam had decided to come to the main hall to help out the others was because he had predicted this. When seeing the ships flying this way, he had been wondering just who could have been piloting them, and the only conclusion he could arrive at were the Chained.

With them on board, he knew the fight was going to be tough. Now wasn’t the time for him to sit back and stay in the command centre. Leaving Logan in control and charge of everything, Sam had decided to go out and help. With his own shadow ability and vampire strength he should be able to do something.

Maybe the remaining ones weren’t as strong as Burnie, but he knew that whoever the Blade family had kept around would have to have a powerful or useful ability. These were people whose strength would only be second to the Big Four.

"Quickly, move them to a medical bay or one of the training rooms!" Sam ordered the Cursed members nearby. While he swung a blood swipe from his hand, trying to ward off another ability user.

Around him, that’s when Sam noticed multiple dead bodies from the Cursed faction. Including those that had learned the Qi powers. With Nate and Layla busy keeping Burnie in check, the stalemate had been broken. Also, looking at the attacker’s eyes, he could see it. The hunger, as if they were obsessed with breaking out.

’Damn it, Peter, where are you! I ...I...need to call Quinn." Sam finally decided as he pulled out his mask... unfortunately, his call didn’t go through and he could only leave a message. It seemed that whoever Quinn was fighting appeared to take all of the Cursed faction leader’s concentration.

’It looks like we’re on our own.’

————

Peter, with Borden on his shoulder, Sil and Shiro were leading the kids out of the training room and through the halls. They didn’t know where to go, but they were looking for the place where there would be the least amount of trouble.

’The others, I can hear them fighting, we need to join them quickly.’ Peter thought, but also he couldn’t just leave the kids. After all, it was Blade’s goal along with Sil and the big bad wolf had yet to show up.

"What are you doing?!" Adeel asked as he stopped and so did the other kids who were following behind the others. "Why are we running away? We can hear the fighting going on, we need to help!"

"You guys are who they’re after." Shiro tried to explain.

"And do you think running is going to help?" Adeel replied. "Hilston won’t just go after us, he will try to kill everyone in this place. If they are fighting right now, then it should mean that he’s using the Chained. If that’s the case then, it also means we’re the ones most suited to fight them!"

"We grew up learning how to use their abilities. Some of us can copy more than one ability and we’ve trained to fight against them. The stronger they are the stronger we are!"

Due to the Blade kids’ young age, the instincts of Peter and the others had been kicking in, believing that they had to be protected, kept away from the battlefield, but these weren’t any normal kids. On top of that they were right. Running away was just stalling for time, when they could be helping fight off the invaders.

"You’re right, screw this. Let’s go!" Peter shouted, turning the other way, and now was heading towards the sound of where the fighting was coming from. Sil wanted to say something but couldn’t so instead he had decided to follow along with the others’ and head towards the main hall.

Borden soon was seen jumping down and grabbing something from Peter’s pocket on the way down. A green syringe stabbing himself with it, his body soon started to revert to the normal size it once was.

"Come on, let’s do this!" Borden shouted.

[Everyone wait!]

A voice sounded through their communicators.

[I heard about what you are planning to, but you shouldn’t just charge in blindly without a plan. If you want to face them, you should do it somewhere where you can have an advantage. You should head to the main hall, because it’s the safest place. The sensors on the ship indicate that there were more sources that had entered through another teleporter in the canteen area, and they have split up.]

[I can’t see who each one was, but two of them have stayed together as they had been heading to the classrooms not too long ago.]

Hearing this, it was easy enough to guess that it was Pai and Vicky. The two Blades they had just seen.

"So the strong ones came in later... which means he might be here as well." Sil mumbled.

[If you follow my instructions I can safely guide you to the hall. I was only able to check now, since the attacks on the ship have stopped, but I still need to remain here to repair the ship as it gets damaged. If the attacks have stopped I can only guess that one of those signals has to be Hilston.]

Even if this was the case. The other people who had entered after would soon join them. If it really was Hilston Blade, then that could mean death for the whole team.

"Wait." Peter said with a big smile on his face. "The main thing we need to do is lure away the ones that are after Sil right. Then I have a plan. Shiro, you take the kids to the main hall. Adeel, I want you to beat the crap out of them all, and leave the others to us."

The next second, Borden felt a mud mask being placed on his face, and his whole image was starting to change. Not much needed to change since Borden looked relatively similar to Sil in the first place. After that, Peter started to transform so he too looked like Sil, making the Cursed faction have three Sils all together.

Shiro, had left soon after, escorting the kids based on Logan’s instructions, while the other three needed to decide which signal they would head towards.

"Are you sure this is a good idea?" Sil asked worriedly. "My mother and father are both ridiculously strong as well, and if any of you two were to meet Hilston you might not make it out alive. I think all three of us should head to one signal and team up on them."

"Do you feel like you stand a chance against Hilston in a fight?" Peter asked. The real Sil remained silent, but the one who was actually Borden was nodding away.

"You see, we’re not scared of Hilston. With the way you are now, Sil, I don’t think you could beat him. Just promise me that if you see one of the others, use them as a warm up, and come save our arses later!" Peter said, running off.

The three of them split up, each heading towards the different signals around the ship. One of them had headed to the canteen and could now see an old blonde haired man with white hair walking there.

Another headed to the entertainment area, where the games would often be and could see a beautiful middle aged woman. Lastly, heading towards one of the other training rooms, there was a man in a full set of diamond armour.

"Oh my, I never expected for you to come to me on your own? What a reunion this seems to be." Hilston said with a smile on his face.

Clenching his fist, and lifting his head, a smile could be seen.

"Come on you crazy old bastard, I’m going to knock your head back a couple of times!"

# Chapter 1198 A ray of hope

Out in the main hall things were getting tough for the Cursed faction. While they had initially been valiantly attacking the intruders, convinced that their high numbers would be enough to defeat them, the tides had turned and the Chained continued to push them back for more reasons than one.

’More and more of them are coming through that damn teleporter!’ Sam observed, drinking some of the blood from his flask. He had overused his blood skills trying to help his subordinates, but to limited effect.

Those around him had switched their fighting styles to a more defensive one, mostly trying their best to survive this battle. Truth be told, if it wasn’t for the Cursed faction leaders being there fighting alongside them, many might have fled, the enemies they were facing were just too strong.

’They must be the ones in the ships who had been attacking us earlier. Hopefully Logan might be able to help us soon, otherwise it doesn’t bode well for us. Nearly half of the people that Nate had trained have died, while we have only managed to get rid of six of them, including Burnie.’

Thinking about this, Sam was biting his lip. They needed a new strategy, fast. There were still many Travellers aboard the ship, but all of them were weaker than the ones still holding the Chained back. Getting them involved would only increase the bodycount, something he wanted to avoid, if at all possible.

In the middle of his thoughts, an ability user had reached Sam, after having subdued the faction member in between the two. He opened his mouth wide and let out a loud scream that pushed Sam’s whole body backwards.

As a vampire Sam had strength on his side, but his ears were far more sensitive than a human’s, causing him to cover them up with his hands. Not only did it hurt him, but it appeared to have a paralyzing effect on him.

With a spear in his hand, the ability user was ready to thrust it forward, until something whizzed past the two of them. The next second the ability user received a punch in his stomach. The Chained tensed but the blow hardly hurt, looking forward he was unable to see the assailant, but the next second, another scream was let out directly next to his ear.

His ear drum burst open, blood flowing down his ear, he fell to the floor, which allowed him to see that the one who had done him in was but a mere child. Then another one ran up to him, creating a giant fist and swung it down hitting the man’s whole head and upper body, knocking him out.

"That’s one down, a couple dozen more to go! Come on, we need to help and deal with the rest!" Adeel shouted.

Other Blade kids charged on to the scene. They were working in groups of three, allowing them to display a surprising amount of teamwork.

Adeel was the one who had saved Sam. He had used a speed type ability to quickly arrive at the Chained and hit his stomach. The damage might have been limited, but Adeel just needed to touch him to copy the sound user’s ability.

Next another Blade kid who also had the speed ability touched Adeel hand passing on the power, and jumped up to the side of the chained’s ear, using the same power on himself. Lastly, one of the Blade’s kids with a growth ability created a giant fist whacking the Chained in the head.

"I guess it was actually a good idea we came here after all." Shiro said, lifting Sam up by the arm. The Cursed faction viceleader couldn’t quite believe his eyes, but a bunch of young kids were managing to do what a group of trained men had failed.

"You’re surprised, right? Well hanging around Sil and Peter for a while I realised something. Even before Raten and Vorden had returned, these kids spent all their time training to fight. Practicing with Raten just made them that much better. It seemed like they had a good base to start with as well." Shiro explained.

Now the tide was once again in their favour. For a second Sam believed they could do it, and he didn’t intend to slack off either. It would be a shame, if they let the kids be the reason for why the Cursed faction would survive such an attack.

However, soon three of the Blade kids found themselves in a tricky situation. The trio had charged towards a man with black tattoos covering his eyes, but when they approached him he had been unafraid. The group of kids had remained cautious of him but when they got close, he suddenly dashed forward and instead of them touching him, he touched the heads of two of them, their bodies immediately sinking to the ground. Their own weight crushing them on the spot.

"What is this? I can hardly move and it feels like an elephant has sat down on me.’

Trying to lift up their hands, they barely could fight it with all their strength before they were pushed down again.

"Oh, so it’s not heavy enough for you. You seem to have the same ability as the Blades but a touch is exactly how my ability activates. They told us not to kill you, but if I die here what’s the point!" The man spoke as he increased the gravity their body was under even further.

Both kids let out a gasp of air, as they felt like their lungs were crushing and collapsing within themselves.

"Let them go!" Sam demanded, and threw two large lines of red aura directly at the tattooed man.

When the Blood swipe was half way, they seemed to hit something and shattered there and then. Another ability user was seen standing by the side, with his hands on the ground. He was the one who had blocked the attack.

’These people, they’re not thinking straight! They’re mad enough to even kill kids for their freedom!’ Sam thought, but no matter how hard he tried to charge forward, people would continue to get in his way. There was no hope for these two children.

"I can not let such an act happen, right in front of me!" An old voice yelled. A flash of blue hit the tattooed man. It lifted him up into the air, and the attack continued to push him onto a wall. His whole body shaking, foam coming out of his mouth, until the attack had stopped and he was allowed to fall to the floor.

Now standing in the middle of the two kids, his old wrinkled hands could be seen, with blue lightning twirling around his fingers.

Bonny and Void were no longer in the hall, but Void, able to control what was being displayed on the livestream, had switched to the main hall camera, which continued to record everything.

"Hey, does anyone know where I could’ve seen that old man before?"

"That grandpa has a lightning ability, how many people do you know who have it?"

"That’s Grim Graylash, the ex leader of the Graylash family."

The comments under the live stream continued to flood in.

The old man soon fired his lightning towards two other users who were close to hitting some of the Blade kids.

"Doing such deeds is not worth our freedom. I would rather fight against our captors again, rather than resort to harming innocent kids!" The old man Grim yelled.

Smiling at the situation, Sam never thought that perhaps, there would be those in the Chained that still had the will to fight back.

———

In the canteen, a middle aged man whose hair was starting to gray could be seen. He was wearing gold armour with large oval shoulders. Had a great sword in his hand, making him look like a knight of old that had fought in many battles in the past.

"Sil, you should understand why we’re doing this. You know why we have to listen to him! There is no human on Earth that is stronger than him. You know how things will end if I fight you, Son, so just come with me willingly."

Clenching his fist, Sil’s whole hand was shaking.

"You’re not the one..." Sil mumbled. "You’re not the one I wanted. That means someone else is fighting against him. I have to... I have to help!"

Not wasting any time, like a flash, Sil moved so fast that his father was unable to see him, the next second and he could feel a strong fist hit him from behind in the back and had lifted him in the air.

It wasn’t just one, but the punches continued to rain down hitting the armour one by one. The armour was strong but it wasn’t invincible. Using the power of six high level abilities at once, and the strength ability, Sil’s hands were out damaging the armour. Blood was coming out from his father’s mouth.

’The damn kid, he...isn’t like he was before. What did he do to get so strong in the meantime?!’

He moved his hand slightly towards the sword but before he could, Sil was seen above him, and using both hands he slammed down hitting his father to the floor. The next second another kick came hitting him again.

His father could simply do nothing to stop the constant attacks happening his way at him.

"I don’t have time, they need me!" Sil shouted, as he started to imitate the hammer punch of Quinn’s. Stomping one foot on the ground, pulling back and snapping his arm out, hitting his father right in the stomach and sending him flying through the doors ripping them out as he went past.

Not a single hit, Sil hadn’t even been damaged in the slightest, but he didn’t notice because he only had one thing on his mind.

’I have to go find Hilston, before it’s too late!’

Not being able to move, lifting his head slightly, the middle aged blonde haired man didn’t know where he was, but he knew what had happened.

’Sil, I wish you luck, because you’re going to need it. Perhaps you can break free from this life that we weren’t able to. I’m tired of this act.’

——

While everyone was still busy fighting inside the Cursed ship, a beeping sound could be heard coming from the command centre. At first Logan thought that their bad luck streak was continuing, but when he saw the reason behind it, a slight smile came back on his face, a ray of hope.

As long as they could hold out for a little while longer, there might be a way out of this without anyone else dying.

# Chapter 1199 Doom

’This is one of my favourite rooms to be in, it’s a shame that it’s going to be trashed any second now.’ ’Sil’ thought inside the entertainment room. It was filled with VR machines, AR games, Block Block, a bar and more.

Standing opposite him was a beautiful middle aged woman in golden armour. From the looks of it, it must have been custom designed, as it was form fitting, allowing for ease of movement.

"Sil, when did you get so aggressive?" She questioned him, convinced that the one before her was her son. "You should know that your little act of rebellion is utterly useless. When has Hilston ever not gotten his way? Just come back to us, my dear son."

Being friends with Sil and related to Vorden, one might think that he would be upset at hitting his so-called mother, but Borden knew the truth as well. Hearing her say such things was making him grind the back of his teeth.

"Son? How can you say such a thing so easily when you know it’s not true?!" ’Sil’ shouted in protest. "When have any of you ever treated us as family?! Hilston isn’t even around at the moment, yet you are still keeping up this dumb act?"

A bulging vein could be seen sticking out from the side of the woman’s forehead. One could tell she was angry even though the smile on her face remained. The truth was, she wasn’t Sil’s mother, nor was she Vorden’s, Borden’s, Raten’s or any of the other Blade kids, as all of them only had one true father and that was Hilston himself. An act that he had forced upon them all.

"You make me sick!" Borden shouted, ready to charge forward, but before he could take even a single step he was hit by a large bolt of lightning. Borden had been able to feel the tingles before the attack had hit him, so he had firmly planted his feet on the floor. Bracing himself, gritting his teeth he had allowed the bolt to hit.

It continued to shock him, and the Blade mother was now starting to worry.

’He’s not going down, did he copy a hardening ability?’ The Blade mother wondered as she sent out more and more bolts. The Mud Mask disguise started to fall off, peeling from his face, and eventually changing the rest of his body with it, revealing Borden’s real appearance. The scales running down his arms and on his head.

The attacks were hurting him, but simultaneously they were releasing a hidden energy inside of his body. Afterall, the more a Dalki got hurt, the more power they were able to summon. He quickly fought through the pain and dashed to the side, picking up the strange Block Block machine that was the same size as a boxing back, and hurled it at where his ’mother’ was standing.

Stopping her lighting, the woman quickly created a giant fist of earth the size of an elephant and swatted it away.

"You’re not my son!" She shouted, the smile on her face had disappeared. Feeling like she had been played for a fool, she was ready to get serious. Following Hilston’s order she had held back, not wanting to accidentally kill the boy he was after, but given Borden’s current appearance it was impossible to recognise him as a fellow Blade kid.

"Neither is Sil!" Borden shouted, punching through the giant fist causing it to split into multiple smaller rocks. Using this to cover himself he dashed in and threw out another, hitting her chest, sending the woman flying away through the air. However, at the same time she had opened both of her palms, firing out a jet of water which slammed into the three spiked Dalki boy. His body crashed through several of the VR machines and Block Block games until he had hit the bar area breaking all the glasses and stools.

’Damn it, I hope they aren’t going to make me pay for all this.’

The woman’s abilities were strong, but it seemed like that was really all the Blade mother had going for her. If that was the case then the fight would be easier than Borden had imagined. Perhaps he had thought this too soon. He could see the Blade mother getting up from the ground.

A Dalki’s punch was no joke, breaking multiple bones even under the armor. A small bit of blood could be seen coming from her mouth, but the next second the golden armour started to glow brightly.

By the time the light dimmed, she looked to be uninjured, even the armour itself was back in pristine condition.

The active skill had healed all of her wounds instantly.

’That’s not fair! Why doesn’t beast gear work for me?!’ Borden was complaining, but that was when his Dalki senses told him that something was up. He could feel a terrifying presence had arrived.

———

At the same time, Pai and Vicky Blade were fighting against two humanoid beasts. One of the abilities that nearly all of the Blades had decided to take before invading the Cursed faction ship was the lightning ability. Unfortunately for the twins, it proved to be almost completely ineffective against the mud like Demi-god tier beast’s body, and Raten continued to absorb the attacks for both of them.

Not only that, but in terms of power, strength and skill, it was hard for the twins to match up. Both of them felt like they were really down to two abilities.

"I don’t understand. I was sure that one of them had to be controlling the beasts, but these two are acting fine even with them gone!" Vicky exclaimed in frustration.

There was something else that was bugging Pai as well. Each of the twins was able to hold a total of three abilities, but as long as they held hands together then had access to even more powerful versions of their six abilities.

However, whenever Pai and Vicky would get close, the tailed beast would throw out an attack or charge into the middle of the two of them, forcing them to separate.

Once again, Pai glanced over to hole in the wall, which the others had used to escape. The few times he had tried to get close to it, a giant slash of wind would come at him, and Tails would follow up.

"Didn’t we already tell you?" Vorden spoke as he went to punch Pai in the face, which the Blade boy dodged. He grabbed the beast’s fist and pulled it forward, intending to knee it in the stomach but before his attack could connect, one of the tails bound the leg. The two of them continued in this fashion exchanging punches and kicks, blocking none of them using an ability as they got swayed in the middle of combat, until.

"Vorden? Am I dreaming, is that really you, but how?" Pai questioned.

Vicky on the other hand, was still firing off her abilities at the Demi-god tier beast, struggling to face what she believed to be the stronger of the two opponents.

"Has that thing hit your head? How does that thing look even remotely similar to Vorden?" Vicky shouted.

However, Pai could tell. Back when they had been living in the castle, they would fight multiple times, and Pai enjoyed teaching Vorden how to fight. Since Vorden would be in control of Sil’s body most of the time and Vorden wasn’t the best when it came to fighting. It had almost become a routine for them and from the way the Emperor-tier beast fought, he could tell.

"Since you know that now, let’s stop this, Pai. I know you still care for Sil and us, so why are you following his orders?" Vorden asked in the beast’s voice.

Hearing this, and distracted even Vicky and a slip in concentration allowed for Muddy to make a cut across her forearm.

"Damn you!" She shouted leaping back. "If that one’s Vorden, then this f*cker must be Raten!"

It was at that moment, that Vicky realised something was up as well. No beast should have thought like this, and even the weapons that were muddled looked more like beast weapons than anything.

"It can’t be..." She froze, but there was no time for chatting, as a red signal was flashing around the whole Cursed ship, and soon it was starting to shake once more.

———

In one of the other training rooms’ Hilston could be seen with his hands held out, pointing towards ’Sil’.

"You dare to call me crazy?!" Hilston shouted as he had stretched out one hand. "The real Sil would never have such guts! Apart from your sharp tongue, you don’t seem to have much else going for you, though!"

"I always enjoy seeing someone proud kneel down before me." Hilston commented as Peter’s body did the gesture without his will. "Telekinesis is commonly regarded as one of the weakest abilities out there. Even the strongest users can’t do much due to the limitation of their MC cells, but for my Blade family it’s no problem."

Peter struggled, but only resulted in him moving slightly. It looked more as if he was shaking in fear more than anything. He knew a bit about Hilston’s ability from Layla. She had once described it to him as moving an invisible force. If one could break free from it, then Hilston would have to locate him again to use it, shooting out the invisible force.

"If Telekinesis really is that strong, then why the hell did you still lose that fight back then, huh?" Peter taunted him. In that moment, using all his strength, activating the beast gear he had, the Wight broke free from the power pushing off the ground.

It felt like he was pushing against a solid steel door but he knew that for a brief second after saying those words Hilston should lose concentration.

’Quinn has been doing what he can to grow stronger, just so he can deal with people like him. It’s time to show him that I’ve been getting stronger as well!’ Peter thought as he dashed forward, and was now by Hilston’s side.

"You have no idea." Hilston harrumphed, as he simply moved the back of his hand. Peter was confident in his strength, he was confident to have grown alongside Quinn’s strength but something had played in his head.

’Protect the head’, a lesson that had been ingrained in Peter for a long time ago.

At the speed Peter was travelling at, if his punch wasn’t able to overpower Hilston’s back slap, then the slap would hit his head. Knowing this, Peter changed his punch, and pulled out the tonfa that were kept by his side, lifting them up.

Immediately, the tonfa broke and the next second, he could feel the bones in his arms crushing, as he was flung to the other side of the room, embedded into the wall.

"Thank you for reminding me, but I won’t make that mistake again." Hilston said, as the armour on his body was slightly glowing.

It was at that moment, that all of Peter’s confidence in winning this fight disappeared.

’This guy....is a monster. He’ll kill everyone.’

The room started to flash red constantly, and the entire ship started to rumble. Then it started to shake to the extreme. Explosions were going off in different areas.

’What’s going on? The attacks should have stopped by now! Did... did one of my tools dare to betray me?!’ Hilston thought, rage on his face visible.

Soon though, a loud bang sounded directly from above them, parts of the ceiling fell to the floor, and then an equally loud bang was made as something had hit the floor. Peter, looking towards what had just landed and caused all the noise. All he could see at the moment was an incredibly long looking tail, black in colour.

———

"Let’s just hope this was the right decision, and I haven’t just doomed us all." Logan mumbled, already half regretting what he had just done.
