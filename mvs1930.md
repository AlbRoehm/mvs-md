# Chapter 1930 A Celestial Mission

Meanwhile, something drastic was about to happen on the moon of mars, and Quinn was nowhere to be seen when this particular battle was occurring. Perhaps it was just bad luck that Quinn was unable to notice the troubles or something that was perfectly calculated and timed by the Celestials not to let it get to his attention. Still, the two men on the moon knew in their hearts that they were stranded, and this could be a battle to the death.

One of them was Sil, and they were about to fight against what looked like a small army of Celestials appearing on the moon.

"Do you have a plan?" Borden, who was also here, muttered as the multiple white portals began to appear in the sky, creating pillars of light which would leave a celestial body when dissipated.

"It's clear that they aren't here just to chat with us. Otherwise, they wouldn't send a whole army like this." Sil gripped the trident in his hand, and just as a white beam of energy was summoned on the ground, Sil threw his trident with all his strength at a precise moment.

It was a big surprise to the Celestial who had just arrived as he found himself pierced right in the chest through the three sharp tips of the trident. It was a strong hit and made the Celestial bleed heavily, but at the same time, it wasn't enough to kill this strange red-skinned celestial. The Celestial pulled out the trident, threw it to the ground as if it were a mere twig, and pounded his chest aggressively.

Soon after, many bright lights appeared around the whole place as more celestials began appearing.

Moving his hand, Sil had the trident reappear directly in his hand again. Usually, summoning his clones would be ideal for a situation like this when he had to deal with multiple enemies at once, but he could not because he had just gone through a tough fight. Not that he couldn't at all, but if he did, his MC cells would fully deplete, leaving him with nothing to defend himself against the incoming Celestial army or if a strong celestial appeared to lead them.

'Is this it? Is this how the Blade family's legacy comes to an end?… And I can't even do anything to prevent it.' Sil's eyes moved from one side to the other to assess the situation.

At the same time, the red Celestial god that Sil had just attacked charged forward. He swiftly moved across the land and had his fist ready to punch, covered with sparkling red energy. Sil was still thinking about what to do and what abilities to use to get out of the situation. He was focused on thinking of counterattack so much that he was practically doing nothing.

It was as if Sil had reverted to his old ways when he was a hesitant young child, lost and in need of help from his friends.

'I thought I had changed…I thought I could help them and get through this for Vorden and Raten. I have carried myself for so many years…so why am I thinking of them? Why am I hesitating now?' Sil thought.

Just then, a large fist smashed the red-skinned Celestial right across the face, turned in its head, and before its body could be sent away to the side, its arm had been grabbed, lifting the entire body and slamming him into the ground.

Unlike the other Celestial they had faced, Borden knew that these guys weren't as strong, but still, a couple of punches weren't going to be enough to turn them into dust, at least not from him.

"Sil, you can leave this to me. Don't forget I'm here as well!"

Bordens shouted as he rushed towards another Celestial, one with razor-sharp blades sticking out from its body. Unlike Sil, there was no hesitation from Borden. In his transformed body, he leapt towards them and grabbed onto the bladed celestial.

The sharp blades punctured through Borden's hands, body, skin, and chest. Although not far enough to drag his main organs, it was enough to make him bleed quite a bit.

"I'm so happy that there is someone like you here. You are just what I need to get a boost." Borden smirked, staring down at the Celestial.

Seeing Borden acting out, Sil still wanted to support them somehow, so he threw out his spear and started using the demon-tier-like weapon's ability as it multiplied to simultaneously attack the other celestials. At the same time, Sil began to pull other demon-tier weapons out from his portal space.

'The best way to get out of here is to not use abilities that take a high toll of MC points on me and use the power of demon-tier weapons to attack. If I do this, I should be able to recover with time, though it won't be done as fast as I would like it to. The recovery might take a long time, I might be fighting for days or even weeks like this, but when my power returns, I will make sure to get rid of every single one of these guys so they can't hurt or damage any of the Blade family.'

Sil had pulled out a pulsating sword that orbited the area around them, and then in his other hand, he held out a shield. A strong beam attack for one of the Celestials came right towards him, but he was able to lift up the shield to block the attack just in time.

Even though Borden was dealing with a good number of the celestials and had them distracted, many were still coming at them, and it was certain that this was not the end of the Celestial army.

'I have to keep fighting. I can't distract myself for even a moment, I have to focus!' Sil pushed through and resumed the battle with all his might.

———

Quinn was on the spaceship, staring at Mundus in the face, who had suddenly appeared in their ship and had something to say. The time around him was frozen as Andy's fist was still in the air without a change in his expression.

'A messenger from that damned celestial space? Damn it! I don't know enough about that place to understand what is happening. What are these celestials trying to do? But I can tell that this person isn't any small fry, so for once, I should take my time and hear what he has to say.'

"Alright, since you haven't attacked me outright, what do you want from me? Why now, of all times, have you come to me to talk? Earlier, none of you celestials seemed to be this nice." Quinn frowned at the latter.

He was still holding onto Minny, who was able to move. But for her safety, he had her enveloped around in his shadow and was ready to put her away in his shadow space at any moment if things took an unexpected turn. He hadn't made a move yet because of the fear that the one in front of him would think he was trying to make an attack, which in turn would put the others on this ship at risk.

If a fight was to break out, then Quinn didn't know what would happen here, to the ship and everyone around, but he was sure that the outcome would not be favourable. There was a place and time where Quinn could be reckless, and this was not.

"I am glad to see that you are holding some restraint." Mundus replied, "Which is essential for our cooperation, and it shows that you are perhaps not as reckless as others might think.

"Look, the Ancient Ones have made a deal with the Celestial that governs the humans and the area of Earth before, so it shouldn't be so much of a surprise that we are willing to make a negotiation again. Let me assure you that this proposal means that the Ancient Ones see you as possibly a great asset."

"Which also means they see me as a great threat." Quinn said matter-of-factly and asked, "So if I don't comply with whatever you request, what will happen then? Because I should warn you that I don't take too well to threats."

Mundus was surprised and, at the same time, not by Quinn's words because, in the first place, the latter was a new celestial, but they had never had such a case where one had risen so fast and was involved with their problems.

"I think you know the answer to that. You have only seen a fraction of what we are capable of, so let me make this clear, there is not a single thing that the Ancient Ones are afraid of, there are just things that seem bothersome, and we would like to deal with them before they get out of hand.

"Regardless, hear out our offer before you decline. We know that you don't like us being involved with you and all, but if you truly wish for us to leave you, the human race and vampires alone, then we have one request. If you complete this request, we will not interfere again."

"Oh?" Quinn squinted his eyes, "What is it?"

Hearing his words, Mundus smiled and said.

"Eliminate the God Slayer Sil Blade."

*****

# Chapter 1931 Celestial Mission (Part 2)


Hearing these words from Mundus's mouth, Quinn was starting to get an idea of what the celestials possibly wanted. Just like with the vampires, who got rid of the dangerous sub-classes, or the Werewolves of the old and Blood Fairies, these gods were doing the same.

They wished to rid the world of the god slayers and make it so no one could trouble them in the future.

'It's quite funny. The celestials always talked about how they were selected by the universe to have been given this role, and how everything is a balance, but if that was really the case, then they should just accept the god slayers existing as they were as well.

'The fact that strong god slayers were appearing must have meant that the universe wanted to get rid of some arrogant celestials.' Quinn thought,

When thinking about the request, Quinn was thinking that it was two fold, as to why they were asking him to do this. For one, it was Sil himself, Sil was incredibly strong, and with his powers, he would be able to stop most.

Then there was Quinn's trust in all of this, by now he was sure that they had figured out that it was him and Sil that had defeated Athos together. If the celestial vampire was to do this, then it would prove to them where his loyalty lied.

"The fact that you asked that question, means you have no clue about me, why I fight, why I have even been fighting in the first place," Quinn replied, instantly. Having next to no hesitation. "Of course, I care about humans and vampires, but maybe not to the degree you think.

"The truth is, I have and always will only care about a few select people that happen to be either vampires or humans. Most of the people that I did interact with have already died, and as time goes on maybe even more.

"Which is why, for those that are still alive, it is important that I protect them, and one of those that you asked me to kill, to take out, well it's one of the few people that I want to keep alive."

Mundus closed four of his eyes, leaving the bottom pair of them open as he shook his head.

"You didn't even think about the request, this will cause huge problems for you, and it is possible that the celestials will send a full force of their power after you."

Quinn had caught onto certain words that had been used by Mundus. Why didn't they just send out a whole army of celestials to earth in the first place to get rid of the problem? Even when attacking Russ, if they had sent two celestials, then he would have been dealt with before Quinn had even arrived.

Using the words could, was a careful choice of words.

'What could the celestials be afraid of, or better yet, what could these ancient ones be scared of.'

Right now, Quinn wanted to meet up with Bliss and would make sure she answered all of his questions before blasting her into the reincarnation cycle.

"So what now?" Quinn asked. "I won't fulfil your request made by the ancient ones. Are you going to send an army to come after us, or are you going to try and kill me right now?"

The shadow created by Quinn's body was on the ground, made by the light source from above. It was slowly getting larger, and creeping towards the shadow of Mundus as he said these words.

"Your answer was a predicted one, which is why an attack has already started," Mundus said as he clicked his fingers and a portal opened up. When it did, it showed Sil, fighting along with Borden against countless celestials.

The fight scene was similar to that of what Quinn had done the last time he had entered the celestial space. While watching the strange magic portal, he noticed that Sil and Borden were doing quite well.

They weren't struggling, and they were pacing themselves as well. It was clear that these celestials that were sent, weren't as strong as the ones against Russ. Still, it worried Quinn that they had already started attacking.

"Are you trying to blackmail me? If so this was pretty stupid of you." Quinn stated. "You ask me to kill someone and then show me a video of you trying to kill him yourselves. If I agree to your proposal, then the attack won't stop."

"No," Mindus replied straight away. "There are plenty of hostages that we could use against you, Quinn. The small vampire in your arms, this man who has tried to hit me, and the list goes on and on as we learn more about your history and past.

"As you said, you are someone who is very caring for other people. What our main goal in all of this is for you to work with us and not against us. If you can't fight against Sil or kill him, then so be it.

"However, we still would like you to complete another task. There is another God slayer that is worrying us…one that goes by the name of Erin Heley."

An image of a musclar toned, straight faced blonde woman had spread in Quinn's mind. It was quite obvious that the Celestials would be keeping an eye on her as well.

"We have learnt that the two of you knew each other for some time, so we know…to kill her, it would be a difficult task for you, but it is a step towards cooperating with each other. By doing this, it would prove that you care more for the cause of the celestials than your own."

Based on their research they knew a lot, and at the same time, hardly knew anything. They were right, Quinn was going to try and not kill Erin, but if there was no choice to, if she had gone too far off the deep end like Quinn predicted, after hearing the tale of what had happened with her and Leo, then he was going to kill her anyway.

'This…gets the celestials off everyone's back. If I solve the problem with Zero, and Erin as well. Then finally…all of this will be done with. Maybe, this is one of the best deals to make after all?'

It took longer for Quinn to answer this time, but eventually he did.

"Okay, I accept your request," Quinn answered.

[New quest received]

[Kill the Dhampir leader (Erin Heyley)]

'Oh the system made this into a quest as well, that will be interesting once the reward is done, but I wonder. If somehow I do manage to get through to Erin, they will still be after her, but we can solve those problems when they come to it, and if they come to it.'

Mundus had a large smile on his face, revealing all sets of his teeth. It spread incredibly wide, with the side of his mouth, nearly touching his eyes.

"This is excellent news. We will call off the celestial strikes on Sil. In the meantime, Quinn, remember, that nearly all of the celestials are watching you, wondering what you will do next." Mundus's body started to turn into nothing but small black particles.

It looked like the wind was drafting these small dust particles off itself in the wind, even though there was no wind which was strange.

Then, Andy's fist had moved suddenly as he threw it out, but had hit nothing solid, and had just made the ship shake and vibrate a little.

"What…what happened there was definitely an intruder on board, they had appeared out of nowhere!" Andy panicked and looked around, only to see Quinn holding onto a frightened and shaking Minny.

"We shouldn't have to worry about it for now," Quinn answered. "If anything, I think now is a better time than any for your father to have by my side. Someone I can speak to again, and who should be able to see the world that he had helped to create."

# Chapter 1932 The Decision To Stay




Although Sil's MC points were slowly building back up through the endless fighting, it was only possible due to Borden being with him. With his body getting damaged and hurt, he was unleashing power that Sil had only seen that the top of the Dalki could perform.

However, he also knew that the stronger Borden was getting, the closer he was to his death, like a flame using up all the power in its fuel.

'I've been trying to just use the Demon tier weapons, but some of these gods have strange powers that are unpredictable. It looks like we are going to have to come up with a new plan. Maybe, if I just gain enough MC cells, I can transport me and Borden out of the area,' Sil thought. 'But then… where will all of these celestials go, they already know about the Blade ship. Will they target that instead?'

This was the question that was constantly on Sil's mind, and now he wished he had never looked into the future, just like Logan suggested, it was causing more problems for him than solving them.

"ARGHH!" Sil shouted as he erupted with energy, swirling around him. It didn't look like any type of ability, as it glowed a faint yellow around an inch off from his body. This was… visible Qi. A power that Sil hadn't been able to use to its full potential for so long.

'There is another person… who could fight, with not just his abilities, or weapons, but with his own body as well. That's what made him so strong, but I didn't want to… I didn't want to become the same monster as him.'

A celestial which stretched out its long brown arms, went towards Sil, and at that moment, Sil had dropped the sword out of his hand, and instead he gripped right onto the wrist of the celestial. The energy moved to his hand, getting slightly larger like a flame, and the next moment, with a flick of his wrist, Sil had broken the celestial's arm.

"I won't let you, I won't let any of you get back on that Blade ship!" Sil shouted and the energy around him was reacting as well. Once again, Sil had managed to improve himself beyond where he had been. The first to have a soul weapon among the Blade family, and now he was also covering one of his other large weaknesses, another power to use even when he didn't have MC cell's.

Sil had gained a new strength and was getting closer to the one he hated.

'I… should think like Quinn. Although our powers are similar and his blood runs through my veins, I can't help that, but the two of us are different. With my strength I will help the Blade family and allow it to continue to grow. Unlike him, who only cared for himself!'

Another fist came towards him full of spikes, and twisting his body, Sil managed to avoid it, while thrusting out the two open palms of his hands. A large Qi strike had hit the celestial, blasting him away in an instant.

In the past, Sil had never been the best when it came to hand to hand combat, but over the course of a 1000 years, even without using his fighting abilities much, he had learned a few things about fighting, in the few circumstances where he needed to use his fists.

He wasn't on the same level as Quinn, but then again he didn't need to be.

Sensing that an object was flying towards him, Sil quickly turned and the visible Qi had moved around his boldly flowing like water and then when reaching his fist, it had erupted into a flame-like power.

Just when he was about to throw out his fist, he noticed that it was Borden flying through the air, his fist had turned into an open palm and caught him. The ground was being crushed underneath their feet as the sheer power could be felt.

Now holding onto Borden, Sil could feel his warm blood on his hands, seeping through the wounds on his back even now.

"Borden, you… you're so hurt." Sil stated.

"Yeah, although individually a lot of these guys aren't so strong, together they can pack quite a punch, but don't worry, it's not over yet." Borden said, lifting himself up with a smile on his face.

Sil didn't know how far Borden could push himself, but he imagined that he had to be on the edge.

'Should I just teleport us away… I can't protect Borden in this state, and I'll be honest, without him…  just using my weapons, and even with my recent power of Qi, it might not be enough.'

There was a tough decision on Sil's hands, now an actual life other than his own was in his hands, and the truth was, he could save him, so if Borden did die, that guilt would be on his hands.

While thinking this, there were around twenty different celestials that charged in towards the two of them, and a decision had to be made fast, until they all suddenly stopped in their tracks.

"What is this!" One of them complained and stomped the ground so hard that several cracks appeared all over the place.

"So many of us have already gone into the cycle!" Another shouted.

Sil didn't act or use this chance to attack them, whatever had occurred, it seemed like the celestials themselves weren't happy about it, and just like the way they came, they were leaving the same way.

Large beams of energy covered their bodies, and they went up towards the sky. Not just one, but all of them, until the only ones that were left on the moon were Sil and Borden.

Immediately, Borden started to revert back into his human-like self, giving him much needed rest.

"Why… why did they all suddenly leave, they could have killed us both right?" Borden asked. "This makes no sense."

Hearing these words, Sil thought about it, but it actually wasn't true. Sil had enough MC points to teleport himself away, he always had enough MC points to do that, and if so, he could even hide and recover, coming back to fight them at full strength again.

In a sense, the celestials never had himself cornered, but those that he cared about, the Blade family and Borden, he was concerned this way.

"Honestly, I have no clue what is going on." Sil replied. "Why were we attacked in the first place, and why did they suddenly leave like that, but I do know one thing."

After this event, and seeing the future, Sil had made up one thing in his mind.

"I can't leave you guys be anymore." Sil stated. "If I was to leave and something happened to the Blade family, I couldn't live with myself. Borden, we are going back to the Blade base, and I plan on staying there."

———

Inside the Blade base, Vorden had already given orders for the Blade family to move out, and prepare to head towards the Mars planet. Without a doubt, he was going to try and do everything to save Sil.

Just as they were getting ready to set off though, after everyone had made preparations, right in front of him in the main hall, Sil along with Borden had appeared right before his eyes.

"You two… are" Vorden shook his head, because he was unsure if what he was about to say really was the case. What if the enemy was coming here right now?

"We are fine for now." Sil smiled. "And I have decided I will be staying here."

Sil wasn't too sure if the crisis was over, or the future he foresaw now had changed because of him, either way he was going to be here to stop whatever was going to come his way.

Outside, off in the distance, a gigantic ship with the words Marpo Cruise was heading into the Earth's solar system.

"How long do we have till we reach the Blade family base?" The man asked.

"I think it will take about a week." Pike answered.

"Good, in a week's time, the entire world will have changed."

# Chapter 1933 The White Trap




Originally, Andy was going to retrieve his father and bring the chamber back to Mars so that Quinn can wake him up. This way, Quinn wouldn't have to do much while he was away. However, a number of things had transpired, not allowing him to do that. This was also the reason they were travelling.

But at the moment, Andy was at a loss for words about what had just happened.

"Quinn… Is everything okay?" He asked.

"Yeah, everything is fine. I have just been thinking a lot. Don't worry."

——

Eventually, the two of them arrived at the new location. It was on a large floating asteroid, which—like other spatial bodies of the solar system—was revolving around the sun. This was also how they were able to predict more or less where it would roughly be depending on what time of year it was.

Just like before, the asteroid was barren and void of life. On top of this, rather than a monument built on the outside—which would give away that something was even on the asteroid in the first place—the tomb, for lack of better words, was located underground.

And to get to the underground location, there was a hidden entrance on the surface. Upon reaching the exact location, Andy pushed a relatively large boulder. It looked heavy, and when Quinn attempted pushing it, he realised that the boulder wasn't just actually a rock. It was just decorated to look like one.

It was made out of such solid heavy metal that even a regular vampire would struggle to move it on its own. However, Andy wasn't any regular vampire; but one who focused on strength in the first place.

Underneath the large boulder was a staircase leading into darkness with seemingly no end.

"I designed this place just for vampires. Not that all vampires are loyal or anything, but you have to make it harder for anyone who is going to come inside," Andy explained.

"This place is kinda cool," Minny replied, as she was content with sitting on top of Quinn's shoulders.

The walk downstairs wasn't long, and eventually, they reached the level floo.,Upon walking across it, they reached a large empty room with several pillars on either side. Then, an empty red stone pathway led directly up to the special chamber in the ground.

"I know you won't fully explain to me what is going on," Andy said as he walked up to the chamber, reaching about a quarter of the way, "But I can tell that something was going on back then. All of the other vampires' chambers disappeared as well, so it was important to keep this place a secret. I'm sure I won't have to tell you to also keep this place a secret, especially when you bring my father back."

Quinn nodded and showed how serious he was about this matter through his silence. That was when Andy took another step forward and reached the halfway point. The rock tiles below his feet started to shine brightly.

There were swirls and patterns that Andy had never seen before, appearing right there and then. Although it was an unfamiliar scene for Andy, the same couldn't be said for Quinn.

,m "Get out of there!" Quinn suddenly shouted and was ready to run right across towards him. But just as Quinn took a step, the light grew bigger, and a large force of energy slammed into Andy— pushing him back and causing him to crash right into Quinn.

Before the crash, Quinn had turned, so his back had hit Andy while holding Minny with both hands. He could feel it straight away that she was shivering.

"Don't worry, Minny, I'm here. I won't let go of you. I won't let her hurt you again. I will make sure to make her pay."

Quinn didn't fall as he planted his feet on the ground, making Andy feel like he hit a solid wall, falling on his backside and rubbing the back of his head.

"What was that?" Andy asked.

When they raised their heads, they found a woman standing in between the chamber of Fex and the two of them. It wasn't just any woman though; it was one who wore quite heavy clothing, a large dress of shorts, and held a staff in her hands, which had a crystal embedded on the very top.

Suddenly, Andy felt an immense amount of power behind him. The blood in his body was tingling, and it was hard for him to get off the ground. Even turning his head slightly was difficult as sweat trickled down his face already.

That was when he noticed the look on Quinn's face. His fangs could easily be seen as he had his mouth opened wide and his eyes glowing red. All of the energy in the room was coming from him.

"BLISS!" Quinn roared, "What the F*CK do you want?"

"Quinn," Bliss stared right back at him, "Now is not the time to be hostile. I am here to show you my gratitude for saving Russ's life, but I also have a warning for you. "

"F*ck your warnings!" Quinn shouted as he started to gather a red aura in his hands. "I still have to make you pay for hurting my daughter!"

A large beam of red energy erupted straight out of Quinn's hands. It went straight towards Bliss, who stomped her staff on the floor. What looked like an invisible wall had spread around her as the large beam of aura had hit it. But this didn't stop Quinn.

Using his blood control, he twisted the blood aura and spread it out before making it a spin. It now looked similar to a tornado. Soon after, the blood aura was pulled back, and then, swinging his hand, the blood aura began to hit the invisible shield again and again until eventually breaking it.

Soon after that, the tornado of blood coming from Quinn's hand went straight towards Bliss. To defend herself, she started to spin her staff as quickly as she could. The blood aura crashed into her staff, and for a second, the blood aura was stopped.

Quinn rushed forward and pushed the air with the blood aura extending out of his own arm. It had forced the blood aura to compact it forward, and the staff couldn't handle the energy anymore. Bliss fell on her back and was hit.

Bliss was ready for another attack to come upon her, but instead, she could see the tornado of blood hovering in place. When taking a closer look at it, inside the tornado itself showed a monster, ready to snap at her at any second.

'His power... it has increased so much since the last time. He has improved faster than I thought he could,' Bliss thought. But right now was not the time to be impressed. If she were killed here, then everything she had done would have been for nothing.

"The only reason I haven't killed you yet is that you still have many questions to answer," Quinn stated. "But trust me, I have many reasons for why I should hurt you badly right now, only leaving you alive so that you can still answer my questions. You risked my friend's life, you hurt Minny, and you have been using me without explaining a single thing!"

Bliss gulped; it was different from her usual calm demeanour. Although she was strong, the way she used her powers had all to do with preparation; she needed time to conjure her spells and set things up. This was how she always won her battles against strong opponents.

However, she knew others were watching her when she was outside, and the place they were in right now was somewhat the perfect place to talk to Quinn. Because of how much attention was on her, she could only prepare so much beforehand.

"I know whatever I say, you might not listen to me. But everything I did was important, including moving your sleeping area!" Bliss shouted back, "I know you might not listen to me, but I think you will listen to him."

Just then, footsteps were heard from behind one of the pillars at the back of the chamber. And when Quinn and the others turned their heads, they saw a man with grey hair stepping out. He looked to be in his mid-fifties, yet had a strong body. He walked forward with both of his hands raised up.

"Quinn, she is right... Please listen to her. And if not her, then at least listen to me, your old friend."

# Chapter 1934 Two Path Quest!




When looking at the person in front of him, the appearance didn't ring any bells in Quinn's head as who this could be. However, time had passed and just like with others, the appearances of many had changed. Even Shiro was hard and impossible to recognise compared to before.

Still, there was one thing that Quinn could recognise, and it was the person's voice. Although changed and bit rougher around the edges, it was a voice that Quinn had spoken to a lot in the past, one of the people closest to him that had helped the celestial vampire out in dire situations, someone that Quinn would never forget.

"Is that you, Sam?" Quinn eventually said, his hands shaking and his power dwindling down, but it was still active.

That name had also caused Andy to raise an eyebrow.

'Sam… a 'Sam' that Quinn knows. Could it really be the leader of the Cursed faction, the one that took the reins after Quinn had left?'

Not many knew about the Cursed faction since they had seemingly been erased from history, but with connections with his father and more, Andy of course knew more than most, and Sam was a figure who had suddenly gone missing when the Cursed faction was being targeted.

An odd smile appeared on Sam's face, as he walked closer from his position, and towards Bliss. The wrinkles where his mouth ended could be seen, and his movement seemed to be somewhat slow. However, when moving in front of Bliss, he gave a single push of his leg, moving him to her side.

Seeing this, some of the anger returned in Quinn's face, as he bared his fangs once more.

"I'm happy to see you again Sam, but… honestly, the fact that you're next to her, I'm going to have to have you explain yourself as soon as possible."

Lifting up his hands, Sam wanted to show that they meant no harm, and even more so, he grabbed Bliss's staff, and threw it away from her, on the ground.

"These God's don't really know how to act when asking for a favor." Sam explained. "But trust me, without that staff she is around 50 percent as impressive as she can be right now, and it's not like the two of us can beat you in the first place."

Putting his hands down, the friendly smile on Sam's face had disappeared as he went on to explain.

"The truth is Quinn… I had been in contact with Bliss, a little, even before your slumber, before your final fight with Graham." Sam explained.

After Richard Eno… was killed, Bliss stated that she needed someone, someone to work with and more than anything she wanted… or rather needed… the help of a Talen. The only problem was she knew that you wouldn't work with, or could trust, her."

"And you can?" Quinn replied. "I'm sure you know what she is, she is a celestial, and they grow to only care about one thing. It's the only thing they care about. We can always figure things out ourselves, there is no need to get help from the outside."

Sam's head tilted down as he looked at the floor.

"Is that really the case Quinn? I know it isn't your fault, but you weren't there after you left. I tried my best to keep the Cursed faction together, to help achieve a peace between vampires and humans… but it just felt impossible.

"The Cursed faction had even become enemies in the eyes of the humans that we had worked so hard to save, and that we had become part of. I had no choice but to believe in Bliss and help her, and she had proven herself many times in the past that in her own way she really was out there to help us."

Even with Sam's words Quinn didn't like it. The celestials were coming to them now, threatening them even, and seeing how they treated lives in the celestial space, Quinn never wanted to work with them or become like them.

"You might not trust me, but you can trust my condition." Bliss spoke. "My condition is to save as many lives as possible. So you should very well know that I will try my hardest, at any step of the way, to do that."

Lifting her hand there and then, Bliss had summoned something causing it to appear in her hand. It was a large clear crystal, larger than Bliss' own hand, and in it there was a strange shadow that was swirling and moving around.

Throwing it in the air, it moved towards where Quinn was. Sensing that there was no harm or ill intention behind the crystal, he grabbed it to look at what it was, and it looked awfully familiar.

"Place the crystal on your daughter's body, and break it, if you do that she will get her shadow powers back." Bliss explained.

At first Quinn thought it was a trick, but there were a couple of things… the shadow power was his domain, and it was unlikely Bliss could control it freely, and the power had already been taken away from Minny so what more could it do.

"I can see you're hesitating." Sam stated, holding a similar crystal in his hand, which had the shadow as well. Sam clenched his fist, and the shadow started to escape. As it did, it wrapped around him, eventually entering through the holes in his face. Through his ears, the gaps in his eyeballs, mouth and nostrils.

After a few seconds the shadow had escaped, and that's when Sam started to use the shadow again covering his hand.

Seeing this, Quinn went to use the shadow link skill, and that's when he could finally connect with Sam again.

"My powers were stored away, because we didn't want you to come and see me Quinn. The way, to get things back to normal, to solve our problems, this process was what needed to be done. As I said before Bliss has been right on multiple occasions.

"She knew that the tombs of the vampire settlement would be taken and there was no way for us to stop it. It was why she had moved the two of you, you and Peter, to a different location. The apartment building was all paid for by myself, or at least whatever was left of the Cursed factions holdings."

For a long time Quinn had guessed that it was all Bliss's doings, and he was correct. He just wasn't aware of the fact that it was her along with another behind the scenes.

"How… how have you stayed alive for so long?" This question was directed at Sam. "And why did you send me to this planet, away from everyone."

"Bliss is a master when it comes to magical things. Magic in itself is something that is special to the world, because it allows one to use universal energy in different ways, as long as you understand how to manipulate it.

"Bliss is able to use magic circles and their rules to make the energy do various things. The easiest way is to think of it like a computer language program. How people can use that to create different applications and software, the same can be done with magic using universal energy. It just takes time to do such things and sometimes there are certain tools that are needed.

"She had created a space for me to stay in, for the time being. I haven't ventured much out of that space, which is why I have aged slowly. However, it also means I haven't seen, and only heard about, much of what has been happening, until you came back of course."

"As for why I sent you away… I explained that already." Bliss answered. "You were gathering too much attention, and even now that you have gotten their attention, it's to the point where now there is nothing we can do, and now we have to work together… come together to stop this.

"Which is why, I wanted to give you a quest… Protect Erin Heley." Bliss asked.

[A new quest has been received]

[This quest has two paths, and depending on the path taken the reward will differ]

[Quest option 1: Kill Erin Heyley]

[Quest option 2: Protect Erin Heyley]

# Chapter 1935 Blood Brother Connected




The system had been somewhat lax with Quinn in recent times, and there was good reason for it to be. There wasn't much other than the celestial points and the celestial ranks for him to track now. However, there was one thing that didn't quite change and that was the random quests that he would get from time to time.

Quests that seemed larger compared to what they were before almost as if it knew these were going to be major events, or major turning points. However, this type of quest was something that he had never seen before.

He had penalties for failing quests and sometimes optional quests, but this, it seemed more like a choice. One that Quinn had to make.

'I guess it's just putting my options out clearly to me.' Quinn thought. 'I'm not sure if Bliss knows about my meeting with Mundus, but I would assume it's unlikely. Which means, she probably doesn't know about the deal that was proposed either.

'As long as I get rid of Erin… then that means, all of the celestials will leave this place alone. Which is exactly what I want.'

The current pause in Quinn talking and giving an answer was concerning for Bliss to say the least. Although she knew that Erin had complicated stuff and had done some things here and there, so there was an expected hesitation, but she thought that he would be jumping for joy to protect her, after all, the two were friends, one of the original group that Quinn had traveled with.

Right now in Quinn's head there were many different things running through it, because his hatred for Erin had slowly been growing. When he had learned about what happened to Fex, and his wife. What she could have possibly done to Owen, and also what she had done to Leo. These things were just the tip of the iceberg.

Especially after talking to Layla, at what the most likely outcome would be, Quinn had somewhat found a peace within himself at what could possibly happen, and when the celestial had suggested his deal, he had been thinking about it more and more. Which was why he had been stumped by the sudden question.

"Why… Why do you need Erin alive? Why is she so important for the human race that you need to protect her?" Quinn asked. "And just to let you know, I also have the other person with me that you last asked me to protect and I'm still not so sure what to do with him either."

Both Sam and Bliss looked at each other for a second, to which Sam had given a little nod.

"It is a hard one to explain the whole truth, but to put it simply, Erin… she is the one with the most potential to grow stronger. A figure that will grow stronger than you.  She is the one that is needed to potentially end a great catastrophe that could end the whole universe as we know it."

Andy couldn't believe his ears at the moment, but made sure to stay close to Quinn, as he was taking everything in. Just what was going to be heard in the tomb of his father, that the outside world had no idea about.

"You can tell us, we have a lot of time, and if I don't like your answer then I'm afraid I'm just going to have to stick to my original plan, even if Sam is standing by your side." Quinn answered. "Sam…  you have done a lot for me, and you are one of the people who I would risk my life for, but you have to understand that there are many others as well."

Sam nodded.

"I understand, and I think it's best if I do the explaining, that way Bliss won't avoid the details that she wishes you not to hear, because I know you best Quinn and I believe you will always make the right decision."

Sam walked towards Quinn, he didn't want to seem too distant, with everything that was going on, but as he got closer, Quinn raised his hand.

"Wait… I think it's very important that whatever we discuss, and what to do with Erin, needs to be heard by another, another one in this room. I need to hear what he wants in all of this."

Andy knew straight away who Quinn was talking about, because it was his father, the one person in the world that was still alive who possibly had the strongest grudge against Erin.

"Thats fine." Bliss answered. "I didn't come here to stop you from waking up your friend. I just wanted to speak to you in a safe place away from the eyes of those above." The celestials are too busy watching planets and things surrounding the close areas near it. They can't see everything that is going on."

Quinn dashed forward straight to the tomb on the other side, and with him, he had brought Andy as well carrying him in both arms. It was a bit embarrassing for Andy,  who was quickly let down onto the ground.

It was incredibly fast as well. Making Bliss uneasy because she knew that this person really did have the power to eliminate her at any point and time. She wasn't safe in this area.

"I wasn't asking, but just telling you what I planned to do." Quinn elongated one of his finger nails, and sliced the palm of Andy's hand without telling him. Doing this, the blood dripped down, dropping off from his fingertips, landing on the top of the chamber.

The blood swirled around, eventually entering the chamber from the ground, and started the mechanism as it moved and made sounds lifting itself from the floor.

"Question." Quinn said, looking at Bliss, while the chamber was still opening. "If I was to make an old and weak vampire into a dedicated follower, passing on celestial energy, would it elongate their life?"

Bliss now understood what Quinn wanted to do.

"It won't be able to return the person to the way they were before, or return the energy they had, but the celestial energy would remain stable in their body. As long as you stay alive, and he doesn't use up all of the celestial energy that you have given him in one go, then he will remain alive."

"That's perfect." Quinn smiled.

The door could be seen swirling open, and moving himself Quinn stood in front of it. When it opened up fully, Fex's eyes opened, faintly glowing red, looking frail and old like he was before. An old dried up man.

"Quinn… I… am happy to see you." Fex slowly stepped out of the pod, to which he took Quinn's arm to hold onto so he wouldn't fall over.

It was a sad sight for Quinn to see, but he bore the pain in his heart, as he held onto his friend tightly, and he could see that Sam was greatly pained by this fact as well. Sam looked at his own hands, although old they were nowhere near the level of Fex.

'I guess, I was incredibly lucky without realizing it… Fex I wish I could have helped you more, and all of the Cursed faction. I am truly, truly sorry for everything I have done.' Saying this in his head, Sam bowed down toward Fex, but that wasn't good enough in his heart. Suddenly he fell to his knees, and kneeled his head down.

"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, I was unable to do more for you." Sam said, with lumps in his throat, making it hard for him to speak.

"Why is everyone in the Cursed faction the same?" Fex smiled. "You are all a bunch of idiots, but I guess that includes me as well. We all tried our best, and that is all we can do."

Turning his head to Quinn, the smile took as serious turn.

"I see my son is alive, and there is a face I don't quite recognize, but the fact that you have woken me up. I assume you have some good news for me, regarding Erin."

Quinn was waiting for this question, and the fact that he had brought up Erin so soon, meant he still had the same feelings as the last time they had spoken.

"I have news, but I still don't know the whole truth myself. I woke you up, so we could work together on this, just like the past. My blood brother, I will allow you to witness the end, no matter what."

Without saying anything else, Quinn placed his hand on Fex's head, and it was time for him to give his celestial energy over, then they would find out why Erin was so important in all of this, from Bliss herself.

*****

# Chapter 1936 Shadow Seat




Quinn had pressed his hand on Fex's forehead, and the energy transfer continued. Celestial energy was floating around the area and was entering Fex rapidly. The influx of energy was so overwhelming for Fex that he was forced onto his knees due to the pressure.

Andy dived forward toward the two as he saw this but quickly stopped, reminding himself that this was Quinn in the end, not some stranger, and based on the things and words the latter had said so far, he would never attempt to do something to his father.

'At least…I hope he knows what he is doing.' Andy stood nervously by the side.

The energy transfer continued, and even Quinn was quite surprised by how much celestial energy had left his body.

'Why is this? Is it because his body was void of vampire energy already? Is that why his body can take this much Celestial energy? Since he is in a weakened state, I thought he would only be able to take so much, but right now, I can tell that his body is absorbing it all like a sponge.'

Picking up the pace and seeing how well it worked, Quinn increased the rate at which he transferred the celestial energy. Due to this, an energy wave was cast from the two of them, and a pulsing sensation was sent out, hitting the others.

"Just how much celestial energy are you planning to give him?" Even Bliss was surprised by the amount of celestial energy and couldn't help but ask.

Quinn glanced towards Bliss's direction. Originally he just wanted to give Fex enough, so he could live to see his revenge played out, to be part of the decision and play a role in what would happen to Erin, but now that the situation was like this.

"I want to give him enough…enough for him to go on the offensive if needed," Quinn replied.

This answer worried Bliss in more ways than one, in particular, because if Quinn was talking about Fex fighting, it would only be against one person.

Eventually, the energy waves stopped in the room, and Quinn lifted his hand off Fex's head as he heard the familiar system prompt.

-ding!

[A dedicated follower has been added]

[10,000 Celestial points have been transferred]

'I know he could have taken more, but let's just see how this will do for now.'

Other than to Peter, and those on the Amra planet, this was the most celestial energy he had given.

[152,256/365,894 Cleistal energy]

'I still have plenty of celestial points for myself to use and also for the weapon that Alex has created. But, in the end, with the way I fight, my own skills matter more when going up against the celestials. And that's if I still will be going up against them.'

Slowly, Fex started to lift his head, and as he did, his eyelids trembled, and the colour of his skin turned lively. As he opened his eyes, there was a solid red pupil like a vampire, and a white outline vibrating greatly could also be seen. He was also using Celestial energy,

Unlike before, Fex no longer felt that his body was weak. He still looked somewhat of the same old man he was, but he felt powerful and could easily move around as well. Now his appearance was somewhat similar to Bryce, the old vampire, but also one with plenty of fight left in him.

"Quinn…you did this? Were you the one that did this? I feel strong again. I feel like I could live for another 1000 years!" Fex was shocked, to say the least.

"Calm down, brother." Quinn smiled. "Sure, you can fight, and I am interested in what you can do, but don't use all that energy up in one go. Otherwise, there is a good chance that you would end up in the same situation that you were in before."

Although this was the case, Quinn also thought he could give Fex more celestial energy later, just like he had done with Peter whenever the latter needed it.

"Now that you are awake, there is something important that we need to discuss," Quinn added.

Knowing how serious the matter was, Quinn placed his hand on the ground, which was covered in shadows. It stretched out to where each person in the room was. The shadow started to rise from the ground, swirling and becoming somewhat of a hard substance until they formed a chair for all of them in a round conference-like set-up.

The shadows around the chair were constantly moving, and it seemed like the others were reluctant to sit on them, but Fex had strong trust in Quinn and immediately sat down.

"Wow, I guess you have learnt quite a few tricks while I have been asleep. I look forward to seeing more of what you can do, brother." Fex smiled and looked up and down at the chair next to him because the shadow chair next to him belonged to Quinn, of all people.

It was far larger compared to the rest, as the back armchairs rose higher than the others looking more like a Thorne. At the same time, Minny was sitting on his lap with a big smile on her face. She was just happy to be there with everyone, even though she wasn't really paying attention to what the others were saying.

"Please, everyone, sit in the seats. I won't do any harm as long as the answers are satisfactory." Quinn said.

Bliss was nervous about sitting down. When she looked at the shadow, she knew what it was.

'This…is the god slayer ability that originally belonged to Krad. I can tell that Quinn has been using it more and developing it. I wonder how far it has progressed. He didn't really use it too much with his fight against the celestial when protecting Russ.'

In the end, Bliss felt like she had no choice but to sit down, and the others followed. When they sat down, the shadow seats felt a bit light, it wasn't hard on the bottom, and it didn't hurt as they expected.

Suddenly, Quinn raised his hand, and another chair appeared in the room, but not only was it a chair, but another person also appeared. With long straight blonde hair down his waist, there was Russ.

"I think since he is somehow involved in this, he also deserves to know about what is going on," Quinn asked.

Russ twisted and turned. But before he could lift his hands, the shadows from the arms of the chairs wrapped around his arms, keeping him there in place.

"You!…and You!" Russ said, looking at both Quinn and turning his head to Bliss.

"Just be happy that you're alive, and we will all get the answers we have been waiting for. So please, explain and give a satisfactory answer of why we should even think about saving Erin." Quinn said.

Bliss gave out a big sigh.

"Look.. it's a really complicated situation, but right now, for humans to survive what is possibly coming, Earth will need as many strong figures as possible. I have been trying my best to keep all of the god slayers alive, and in this case, each individual is as important as the next.

"You should know that the Celestials have already begun to attack the god slayers, and there is a good chance that they will get involved in humans, vampires and all the lives here."

Although this was true, Quinn wondered if the Celestials would keep their word if he was to eliminate Erin.

"I don't understand much," Fex said. "But, your point is that Erin is one of these god slayers, and we need them to fight against another group of people, but in my eyes, Erin is someone who is hurting and killing these strong figures in the first place.

"If anything, she is deserving of death for multiple reasons and those that I definitely can't forgive. So if only she were to die, then what is the big deal?"

"I agree as well," Quinn said. "Fex's anger has a legitimate reason, and Erin has hurt others, as well as killed Leo. I'm afraid this is something even I can't forgive.

Hearing these words, Bliss let out a deep sigh.

"To understand why we need Erin, we need to learn about Immortui and his position in the celestial world. What vampires really are, and who Immortui is."

*****

# Chapter 1937 Immortui




,m At first Bliss seemed hesitant to speak, even though she said she was happy to explain herself, she had bitten her own lip several times as she struggled to get the words out, making them all think what exactly was the big deal.

"It's hard to find a place to start." Bliss finally said. "There is so much history in the celestial world, so much time that has passed, that it is impossible for you all to comprehend. So I will have to try and make it so that nearly all of you can understand as much as possible."

Bliss went on to tell the others about the celestials themselves, and where she started was with the ones that were known as the Ancient Ones. It was unknown to the celestials themselves whether or not the Ancient Ones were some of the first ever celestials.

It was suspected that they were, and many assumed this was the case, but it was unknown either way. However, without a doubt the Ancient Ones were the ones that wielded the most power of the celestials themselves and there was a reason for this.

The Ancient Ones had been given their name because they had managed to control the universal energy to a higher degree compared to any other celestial, not just celestial energy, but the universal energy that decided and made up everything in the first place.

The Ancient Ones were able to use this energy to create things that others couldn't, making their own rules and creations that just wasn't possible compared to others. They didn't need celestial energy because they could always just use the universal energy around them.

In a way, what the Ancient Ones could do was somewhat similar to how Bliss used her magic, only on a far grander scale, and allowing them to do far grander things.  An example of this was the celestial space that all of the celestials used, this as well as the system the celestials had, was created by the Ancient Ones. It wasn't something that celestials would just have.

Regardless, just because they were able to control this energy, it didn't mean they could do as they wish, nor could they control the universe at will, only parts of it when they wanted to. Which was why celestials, god slayers, and more were beyond their control when it came to things like this.

Still, they were able to do a number of things, which would make them unmatched by nearly any celestial, especially if the three of them were together.

Hearing all of this, something had clicked in Quinn's head.

'That messenger from before, didn't he say he was here on behalf of the Ancient Ones? I guess now it makes sense for them to even be able to make a deal like that, and if they are as dominant as Bliss thinks they are, then it also means they really do have the power to stop the celestials from coming to Earth.'

Thinking about how large and vast the celestial space was, Quinn could only imagine their power and realised how it kind of made sense now. Although he had increased his celestial level, there were still restrictions in the celestial space that didn't quite make sense to him.

If this was something that was controlled by the Ancient Ones, rather than the universal ways and power, maybe he would never get access to use the celestial system and space in the ways the others could.

"Now, the reason why I have told you about the Ancient One's is because their relationship with Immortui is quite an important one." Bliss continued to explain.

"As you may already know, me and Richard Eno in the past had worked together, and Richard had managed to open a portal to another world, or more correctly another plane. Almost like another universe that fits or overlaps with ours, and there are many like this."

"Just like on this plane, there are the respective celestials controlling each of the areas. Some celestials are able to move between each plane or there are even certain people with powers that can move between each plane. But an important note is that the Ancient Ones are also able to move who they wish between certain planes.

"One of the celestials that live in another plane is Immortui. In the past when Richard had opened up the portal in order to obtain more power, Immortui had planted seeds of power all around earth. That was how the vampires were created.

"However, Immortui is a far more powerful being, so much so that the Ancient Ones themselves were afraid of his powers. Immortui isn't just able to create vampires, but he is literally able to turn living creatures into demons.

"Multiple different creatures beyond one's imagination, and a vampire is just one of them. In some way, Immortui's power is seen even in the vampires as they too can create different types of creatures but nowhere near on the scale of Immortui himself.

"The creatures that Immortui has created have been so strong that they even have had the power and ability to go up against other celestials themselves, and he himself knew this. Which is why, in the past at one point and time, he had decided to go up against the celestials and the Ancient Ones."

"Why though?" Andy suddenly asked, getting a grasp of a few things and interested in the story. "Sorry, but from what you explained to all of us, celestials or gods, have conditions that need to be completed, and that's the only thing that gains them a sense of feeling, which is why all of them try hard to complete it.

"So then, why the need to try and rule the celestials, what would that do? I can't believe it, it is beyond the point where one just would want to rule. It seems a bit silly for those that are in such a high position."

Bliss started to nod.

"You are correct, it was nothing like wanting to rule the celestial space or anything like that, but it was precisely because Immortui wanted to complete his condition. Because his condition is death, the loss of lives.

"Immortui's condition is to get rid of as many lives as possible. Whether that be beasts, humans, and all sorts of creatures. It's a powerful condition as there are those that are dying everyday, and it is also why his power is beyond nearly all of the celestials and maybe even equal to the Ancient Ones.

"The problem was Immortui was obsessed with his condition, but you see, life is something that many of the other celestials need to complete their conditions. With Immortui feeling restricted and wishing to do as he wished, a fight broke out.

"It took the strength of the three Ancient Ones combined, and even then they were unable to defeat Immortui, but they did seal him away in the other plane with no way for him to get out."

Andy wiped his head, hearing these words, because Immortui the creator of the vampires and other things sounded too menacing for any of them to deal with.

"The only problem is, he now has a way of returning, due to the red heart." Quinn said, remembering Logan's words.

"Precisely, my fear is two fold. If Immortui returns, he will plan to use the humans to create greater demons to wage a fight against the Ancient Ones again. The truth is, I doubt the Ancient Ones even know Immortui is planning this.

"They have left him in charge of the humans, because it is one of the most concentrated amounts of lives in the universe that there is. So they were hoping that his condition and hunger would be somewhat satisfied. At the same time, there is me as well, in order to create that perfect balance as much as possible.

"In fact, the Ancient Ones so much don't want to cause a conflict with Immortui, they have left earth alone for the longest of times. Which is even now why they are so reluctant to get heavily involved.

"The problem I have is, if a war were to start I know the celestials wouldn't hesitate to get rid of all of the humans. They are preemptive. They know that if there might be a way for Immortui to escape he would have to use the people, and lives are needed in the first place to fully use the extent of his powers.

"Which is why I have been gathering the god slayers, to save the human race, and if worse comes to worse, we might even have to pick a side. Whether to join Immortui, or the celestials. Either way, at one point or another we would have to deal with them both.

"Quinn, although I am confident in your strength, time is running out. For Erin, the dhampir, her strength grows considerably depending on who she is facing, and on top of that. Her powers won't only work on vampires, but all demons that Immortui is able to summon, including himself.

"In a way, Erin is the shortcut to our answer if we ever need to face Immortui. So do you understand why we need to save Erin? Even if she is taking a few lives here and there."

Bliss was waiting for an answer, she tried to explain things as best as she could, hoping that she was convincing enough.

Quinn turned and looked towards Fex, wondering what he thought in all of this. His hands were clenched.

"I'm sorry Quinn. I just can't look at the grand scheme of things… I still wish Erin was dead."

That's when Quinn let out a sigh.

"Don't worry… I agree. As I said before, what is important to me, isn't what happens to the human race and such. They have lived a 1000 years without me, and maybe will live another 3000 before this is to happen, but it's what happens to those I care about now.

"I will stop Pure from summoning Immortui, and I will also try my best to convince the celestials to stay away from earth. However, as for Erin… I have to stop her… before she kills anyone else I care about."

Quinn stood up from his seat, and the shadow started to disappear from the others.

"Come on Fex, it's time to pick up my weapon, and go see her."

******

# Chapter 1938 The Missing One




Quinn had made up his mind, and truth be told, learning the truth of why Bliss was trying to meddle with his current plan, it had changed nothing for him. Because in the end, it never explained why Erin was doing what she was doing. Why she had changed so much to the point where she had not only killed those closest to her, but was continuing to hurt others closest to her.

'People have made the mistake too many times already of trying to save Erin, it's best if we end this one.;

Quinn didn't really care about the other details, and now with Fex by his side he was ready to travel again.

"Russ, I will be taking you with me for now. I think, based on Bliss's words, it would be safer for you to stay with me in the first place." Quinn stated.

Without giving a chance for Russ to reply, he sunk into the shadow chair he was sitting on, and once again was in the Shadow space. There was one thing that Quinn found interesting about Russ' power.

Because he didn't quite understand what it was or how it worked, and yet, Russ never once attempted to use it to break out of the shadow space they were in, at least not to the same degree as he used his powers outside.

At first, Quinn was waiting for Russ to use his powers, then when he could see his MC cells drastically going down, Quinn was going to head in there and teach Russ a lesson, making him calm down and stay in the shadow space, but there was no need.,

A very minimal amount of MC points had been taken when Russ tried to escape. Russ had decided to either stay put, or for some reason, was unable to use his powers while in the shadow space.

Walking away, with Fex and Andy now by his side, Quinn was ready to leave the room and got rid of the other shadow chairs. Immediately, the staff that Bliss was holding onto started to light up, and she had soon sped in front of the three with her staff pointed directly at them.

"Quinn, are you really going to go against the human race? If you get rid of Erin and Immortui wins his battle against the celestials then he could get rid of every single life there is!" As Bliss talked, the crystal on her staff lit up.

"Immortui was the one who created the vampires in the first place as you stated. The truth was I planned to keep my promise I made a long time ago to a certain someone. One way or another I was eventually going to meet Immortui anyway. You seem to be so sure of a fight happening, perhaps it's because you can see the future, but I know, as well as you do, that what you see isn't always the outcome, otherwise you would never try to meddle in the first place."

Taking more steps forward, Bliss lit up her staff and fired it towards Quinn. Seeing this, he could tell that the attack wasn't too strong, but the celestial energy within it was. That's why he made a small cut on his hand, and in doing so he had formed the celestial blood from his own body into a gauntlet.

After that, Quinn threw out his fist, wrapped in his aura, and smashed the energy, breaking it into small particles on the spot.

"What do you think attacking me is going to do? Are you trying to kill me, do you really think this is going to help out your cause?" Quinn replied. "Even if you have more celestial energy than me. I realised in the fights I had, that celestial energy isn't everything. Even just then, I only had to use a small amount, along with my own strength.

"If you try to get in my way, I don't think this will be favorable for you."

Gripping around the staff hard, Bliss knew he was right, and she eventually held it upright, and stood to the side, along with Sam, allowing the three of them to pass, along with Minny, who had hopped on Quinn's back again.

"I will do what I think is best like I always have done." Quinn commented as he walked past Bliss, and then looked toward Sam as well. "Sam, you are a smart person. I know you will continue to work with her, and that's why I haven't killed her.

"I know that my actions might cause a strange outcome, but I also know that you are a smart person. You will always do the best you can to sort out the situation, and if you need me, I will be there to help you, just not this time, not for this favor."

With the shadow link, and Sam having regained his shadow, Quinn could always head back to him, and he was somewhat hoping that Sam would stay with Bliss, just in case he needed to ask more questions in the future.

The information about Immortui was interesting, and if it ever came to the point where they would need to fight, the information that Bliss had would be needed greatly.

'Immortui, I assume Laxmus was a dedicated follower of yours, and you have great power as well. He is most likely also the one that promised Zero that he would bring the others back according to Chris.

'It seems like he has been meddling in human affairs a lot as well, trying to plan something with Erin being the key to defeating him. I can tell Immortui is strong but does that mean Erin is really strong enough to defeat someone like that?'

Thinking of this, perhaps if Quinn was to face Erin, she wouldn't be as easy of an opponent as he originally thought.

After leaving the underground tomb and now back on the surface of the meteorite, Quinn tried to set up his shadow link again. He could sense Sam which was good, but there was a problem, for some reason, he was unable to sense Alex. Someone who had recently come back.

'Huh, how is that possible, has something happened to him? But he sent me a message saying that the weapons were completed… he was in Green City right… is everything okay?'

Panicked, Quinn had no choice but to take the ship they had come in back to Earth. As they were doing this, Andy had gotten in contact with his base and they had been informed that Green City was completely fine.

If that was the case though, then what of Alex? Why couldn't he use the shadow link to head back to him anymore.

After dropping off Andy, Fex and Andy had said quick goodbyes to each other. Fex promised that he would meet his son again after he had completed his revenge. In the past, Andy would have thought these were words of a mad man who was obsessed. Looking at a goal that could never be done, but they were so close, that now it was possible.

Andy couldn't wait to talk to his father like he had done before, before his mother had died.

After that, they had reached Green City, and had entered Green tower just like they had done before. Heading to the top floor, they could see that Logan was there to greet them, but he didn't have the best of looks on his face.

"Alex… what happened to Alex?" Quinn asked immediately. "I got his message saying that he had completed making the weapon, but now I can't use my shadow link to get to him. Were you guys attacked?"

Logan shook his head.

"No we weren't attacked, and I was the one that sent you that message accidently. Quinn, I'm afraid… I don't really know what happened to him, but it looks like some bad news. All I can do, is show you this video."

Pressing a button, the video of inside the forging room was seen, and at the same time, Quinn could witness two things, Alex completing the weapon that he had requested, and after that the battle for his life.

# Chapter 1939 Blue Fang And Red Fang




Having watched the video that had been prepared by Logan, Quinn's hands were shaking while his lips were quivering as he saw the scene.

"How…how is this possible? What happened?" Quinn asked.

"I have yet to enter the place properly," Logan replied. "I have locked the room and denied access to anyone in there. However, no matter how many times I check the security footage, hoping that Alex will appear again, there's no sign of him."

Hearing those words, Quinn immediately felt extreme guilt. After all, he was the one that had requested the weapon to be made. On top of that, seeing that his shadow links weren't working, it meant one thing. What was shown on the video footage was real. It had to be.

Sometime later, Quinn started to walk.

"You guys stay behind. I'll head down there on my own to see what's going on. No one is to step foot in that room until I come back."

While looking at Quinn gradually getting farther, Fex couldn't help but shake his head.

"It looks like there's always some sort of drama going on with him around. Anyways, I'm sure you have the vampire corps to run, Andy. I'll look after my little niece here, and Logan, it would be good if you could update me on what's going on so far while I will do the same. We've had quite the interesting encounters since I woke up, if I do say so myself."

——

Quinn stood a floor under the main lab where Logan's base would be. This was where the forgery was, with two large thick doors leading to the forgery. Rather than opening the door, Quinn used his shadow travel skill to travel underneath and reappear on the other side.

The forgery was like those that he had seen before, just with a modern design and twist of simplicity in places. Surprisingly though, there was still an intense heat in the room, coming from the furnace and a lot of the machinery that was used still being on.

'I guess Logan really did leave everything the way it was when he found it.'

"Alex!" Quinn shouted. "If you're there, reply! Shout out back to me! I can help you!"

From the look of things, on video, strange tentacles made out of blood spread out and had been attacking Alex. Due to the camera angles, it was unclear where these tentacles were coming from. Though, it strangely seemed to be from the strange mold he was producing for the weapons.

Unfortunately, there was no reply. Nevertheless, Quinn still carefully walked around the room, condensing a small amount of blood aura in his hand, ready to be used at any point and time. That was when his eye had caught something.

Taking on a humanoid shape, there was a full set of armor, one that looked familiar to what Quinn had seen before, yet clearly different at the same time.

"This…it's..it's the Blue Fang set, right? It has to be," Quinn said to himself.

Then again, it was wrong to call it the Blue Fang set. After all, the set was no longer silver with blue trimmings like it was before. The colors for it had completely changed. Now, it was mostly a solid black armor, with its points and trimmings a bright red.

It looked like armor fit for a demon lord of some sort.

"Alex, you…repaired the set, didn't you? But… is it the same as before? What's the reason for the color?"

Thinking about this, although Quinn wanted to try and find Alex, he couldn't help but use the Inspect skill on it.

[Red Fang Demon Tier Chestpiece]

[Red Fang Demon Tier Shoulder Guards]

[Red Fang Demon Tier Trousers]

[Red Fang Demon Tier Boots]

[The Red Fang Demon Tier set made by the legendary forger, Alex Way.]

[The pieces of armor was originally made with the legendary Blue Fang Wolf that was known for its speed. However, the set has been altered, having used crystals from the Volcanic Rocket Beast.]

'Well now, I understand the reasoning behind the change in color. I guess Alex thought it would suit me more, but I thought the Demon tier beast crystal would just be used for repairs…does that mean its active ability might have changed? All the equipments' stats are the same as they were before.'

[Active Skill: (Nitro Accelerate) For two minutes, the user is able to increase their speed by 100 percent.]

[Cooldown time: 1 hour]

'This is slightly different compared to what it did in the past. Before, it would combine the agility points of all the stats the armor gave before adding it to my agility. In a way, this is better since it stacks with my own speed. As my own speed increases, the percentage will stay the same.'

'Even though my speed hasn't improved much lately, we'll have to see if I am faster than before. It also honestly seems to have the effect from before, making the armor somewhat pointless after using the skill.'

It was certainly an improvement because of that, but what caught Quinn's eye even more was the fact that there was another active skill that wasn't there before.

[Active Skill: (Nitro Casting) When this skill is active, for two minutes, the user can cast attacks at a faster rate.]

'Is this for real? Cast attacks faster. The armor has always just increased my speed, so the speed of my fists, legs and such. But this skill will actually allow me to cast attacks faster. Does that also include blood aura?'

This was certainly something that Quinn wanted to test out straight away. However, now wasn't the right time, he needed to find out what happened to Alex. Regardless, the armor was something that he couldn't have others get their hands on. So, using the shadow, he was ready to place it in his space, that was until he thought of something.

'Should I…make this a Celestial armor piece?' Quinn thought. 'There's a chance that it can lose its active skills, but after hearing what Bliss said, and having a meeting with Mundus… the equipment I should have needs to be better.'

'And if Alex is truly gone, then there won't be a chance for me to make anything after this… or at least find a forger as good as Alex. In fact, I don't want anything to be made by anyone else but him.'

There were times where risks needed to be taken. Since he had used the marking on weapons before, he thought that it was time for him to do some more testing.

'There are times where risks need to be made, Alexrisked his life creating this equipment, and here I am getting worried that it will lose its effects. Whatever changes the armor would undergo, it won't be worse off than it is now.' With that in mind, Quinn placed his hand on the armor.

'Give me something that can take down and protect myself from those around me!' Quinn stated as the armor pieces started to light up. Soon, he could feel the energy going into each of the pieces. He didn't know how many Celestial points this would take, but since this was an armor for himself, he wouldn't mind so much,

After all, in a way, the Celestial equipment could be used to fight against other Celestials including others. Sweat soon dripped down Quinn's face. The only time he felt tired these days was when he used Celestial energy. But eventually, the job was finally done.

Every single piece of equipment had the familiar marking that Quinn had put on all his dedicated followers, along with other things.

[10,000 Celestial points have been used for each piece of equipment.]

[40,000 Celestial points have been used.]

[112,256/365,894 Celestial energy]

[Inspect]

'I see now.. well, I'll say that, without a doubt, this is definitely an improvement. I guess I did the right thing, after all. Helen, Alex, once again I have to thank the both of you for making this legendary armor set.' Quinn smiled.
