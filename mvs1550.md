# Chapter 1550 - Blade's Quest Complete
Out of the corner of Vorden's eye, he could see something glowing from Sil's chest. Seeing this, Vorden felt like his eyes were playing tricks on him because there were only two things that this could possibly be, and for some reason, he didn't think it was the first.

When the brothers had found out about Blade island, they wished to know more about their father Hilston Blade. Why he did the things he did, and the reason behind them. In the end, they had received their answers from Brock, who was one of Richard's most trusted vampires.

During that time, they found out that Hilston had a strange complex - a complex to constantly get stronger by searching for new power through his blood. He had a plan to take over someone else's body if he found them stronger than him while carrying the Blade family powers.

Sil was the first one, the first Blade family member to wield six abilities at once. The strongest blade in terms of ability-wise in existence, yet that wasn't the only reason why Hilston was obsessed with Sil; instead, it was because Hilston believed that Sil could very well be the first one ever to unleash a soul weapon.

It didn't take long for Vorden to see what Sil was doing. When the glow over his chest dimmed and slowly died out, everyone else noticed a book in front of him. The strange-looking book was a mesh of different colours, like a mixed rainbow.

"Sil, is that a soul weapon? An item type soul weapon!" Vorden exclaimed.

Of course, now wasn't the time for Sil to answer. He soon opened the book and turned to several pages. Upon reaching the right pages, Sil would close his eyes, and a strange glow from the book would go through Sil's chest.

He did this a few times and eventually placed the book away. Putting it back inside his chest. Vorden was confused, to say the least. Soul weapons, even item types, were normally used in combat. To help them fight, a finisher moves per se or a final stand. Yet Sil had summoned it then put it away.

"Everyone!" Sill shouted, and suddenly, both his arms lit up blue, and his hair was standing on its end. In his hand were two solid forms of lightning. The next second, a strike from the sky appeared, and Sil was seen right above the Dragon's head.

Sil slammed down the two pure bolts of lightning into the Dragon's head. One had gone through the eye that Peter had initially damaged, and the other had gone between its nose and disappeared. Everyone had seen the pure lightning bolt get through the skin of the Dragon.

'This doesn't make any sense... It has been over 24 hours since Sil touched anyone with the lightning ability...how is he able to do that?'

It didn't stop there, as Sil held on tightly onto the Dragon's head. With his super speed, he quickly moved to the Dragon's ear and hung on the edge. Then using his hand, a spark of solid white light began to form.

The others weren't sure what happened, but they heard an incredibly loud bang in the next second. A sonic blast had hit the Dragon in its ear, bursting whatever it had of its eardrum. Its head flung to the side, and Sil fell towards the ground, but he didn't stop there.

While in midair, he transformed his body into a bolt of lightning, shooting himself after the falling Dragon. A second before his momentum came to a complete stop, Sil threw his fist, hitting the side of the Dragon's face, right on the snout.

Everyone heard a loud impact again, and the Dragon's face swung faster, and it looked like its whole body was falling to the ground.

"Wait.. that power... I'm sure Sil's punch has gotten more powerful." Nate noticed.

Sil still had the demon tier shield, and sure he was relying on a boost from the weapon, but that wasn't the main reason. It was all because of his soul weapon.

While the Dragon had fallen onto its side, Sil wasn't giving it a chance to rest. He made a single pure large lightning bolt, this time in his other hand, and it was far larger than anything they had ever seen Owen create.

Sil's whole right arm was lightning up blue as he held the bolt of lightning in his hand and threw it, causing it to pierce right through the Dragon's wing in an instant. Beaming with energy, the bolt stayed stuck in the wing and began to pulsate.

With each pulse, it shocked the Dragon's whole body, and in response, the Dragon roared. It looked like the shocks from the lightning had stunned it in a spot, keeping it paralysed. At the same time, the black sword was stopping it from healing like how it healed its eye.

Seeing this, Sil's body started to levitate, revealing another power they hadn't seen until this point. He went up through the clouds to the point where the others couldn't see him while the bolt continued to shock the Dragon.

'I know the Dragon is weaker compared to what it was before...it had its energy drained, but how can Sil injure it to this degree?' Vorden thought.

Seeing the amount of power Sil was displaying right now reminded Fex of something. This power level was almost the same as Sil had shown when going up against Nicu.

Everything that Sil was doing now, everything he was showing, was all due to his Soul weapon. The book was no ordinary book. It was almost like a personal diary that was made just for Sil. Each book page signified each ability he had ever copied during his lifetime.

The book allowed Sil to switch out any of his current abilities, with any of those in the book, and in the book itself, Sil had all of the powers of the Big four, including all of their MC cells. It didn't matter if he hadn't touched the others within 24 hours or not, now that he had the book.

Sil had managed to do something that Hilston had never achieved, not just creating a soul weapon but overcoming the weakness of the Blade family ability. With this soul weapon, no matter where Sil was or who he was with, he could reach his strongest.

Right now, no one could see where Sil was, and on the ground, they noticed that the pain was now becoming bearable for the Dragon. It started to lift its body, ripping its wings as they tore through the pure lightning bolt.

"What are you guys doing? Kill that thing!" Peter shouted as he charged forward with his familiars. The Dragon was clearly slow as Peter proceeded to punch it.

Seeing this, the others followed suit, attacking it with blood powers, even emptying their MC cells and Qi, to injure the Dragon even more. Unlike before, the hits it was taking now seemed to affect it somewhat.

Even if they couldn't get through the scales, they could still hurt it, and that was exactly what they were aiming for. However, one part of its body recovered faster than any other, and that was its tail. Once again, the Dragon swung its tail towards anyone who was at the back, and the one that was at the back this time around....was Fex.

He knew that the Dragon's blows were powerful. If he got slapped by this tail, it was probably the end of his life. They had all avoided a strike thanks to Sil's foresight ability.

"Don't worry..I know what's going to happen. My brother will save you." Sil said from above.

As the tail came towards Fex, he placed his hand on the ground and made a blood barrier, but the tail broke through that in an instant. Closing his eyes, he braced himself until he saw a full-sized what looked like a humanoid Dalki get in between him and the incoming tail.

It grabbed the tail in place, holding it with all its strength, stopping it, and then threw it to the side. When turning around, the others could see him.

"Borden!" Fex said. "You saved my life...and you're... big now! Is this permanent?...wait...you have five spikes!"

"I think it's permanent," Borden replied.

Perhaps if Sil's attack didn't already weaken the Dragon and made it dizzy, the tail would have hit them both, but everything, including Borden now having five spikes, was seen by Sil through his ability.

The Dragon lifted its head, and the next second, Sil came down from the sky, shooting down like a torpedo and slammed right on top of the Dragon's head. Pushing it down into the crater so hard that it lifted its back legs, and the crater expanded even more. They had gone so deep into the land that ponds of water were starting to form, but they could see Sil stood there on top of the Dragon, having defeated it.

"I...I was saving that for Graham...but this was a good test as well." Sil smiled.

Only the next second and the Dragon began to break down into particles. Bit by bit, its body was disappearing.

"What's happening?" Layla asked.

"I think...we killed the dragon," Logan replied, not knowing whether this was a good thing or a bad thing.

*****

# Chapter 1551 - Destroy Everything
It was the first time the group saw this happen to a beast. After they had dealt with it, the Dragon's body split into thousands of light particles, and it slowly began to disappear. To the people at the scene who had been to the familiar world, it reminded them of what they had seen in the familiar world.

After waiting a while, there was nothing left of the Dragon, and the light particles had vanished right in front of their very eyes. Everyone stayed there in the crater for a moment, not saying anything. They were exhausted and had expended all of their energy and MC cells.

It was the same for Sil as well. He didn't hold back when using the MC cells he had gathered because he knew he couldn't take this battle lightly because his foresight had revealed what would have happened if he had hesitated any bit. The only ones left somewhat standing due to not doing much was Logan and Linda, who had arrived with Borden.

Everyone started to make their way out of the crater, and once reaching the edge, they sat down facing the tower. They wanted to ask about Borden, see if he was okay now or not. After all, he had now become a five spike.

They now had the type of Dalki as an ally which they once had the most challenging time confronting. But they knew it wasn't the time to celebrate because there was something else on their minds.

"This... isn't good, is it?" Linda asked. "You said that we were meant to capture the Dragon, report back to Sam before we dealt with it. Isn't there a chance that it will combine with the other one in the shadow space now and mess things up!"

This was why all of them worried because they somewhat knew this was what was most probably going to happen.

"I'm sorry." Sil eventually said. "I couldn't hold back. I could tell the Dragon would have found a way to get the black sword out from its neck. It would have then healed itself. I would have run out of MC cells, and we would have never defeated that thing....it would have killed us all. Simply put, if I didn't go all out and kill it, then we would all be dead by now."

Although Vorden didn't know how far ahead Sil could see in the future, based on everything he was saying, it was pretty far ahead, but now that Sil had exhausted his MC cells, it would be next to nothing.

"We might not have to worry too much," Logan said as he looked at the crater where the battle had just occurred. "Although we can't be sure, I have a theory. When the vampires dealt with the Dragon Demon tier beast before, it would usually split itself into two parts whenever it was in a weakened state or close to death.

"This seems like a survival instinct more than anything. Sure two dragons might be better at fighting, but then why not just stay in two separate forms the whole time? I believe, as I said, it's to survive. One half continues to fight while the other half runs away.

"Now, why would it run away? The answer is, even if you kill one half, it won't immediately rejoin the other. It needs to buy time. I believe this is why we also found one half of the Dragon appearing on earth in an attempt to go as far away as possible so it could survive or as Quinn said, it was attracted to the tablet's energy and was trying to heal itself.

"Either way, my point is, I think Quinn is not in immediate danger."

The group was ready to set off, but before they did, Logan checked for any other signs of the Dalki or vampire clones for reassurance.

"So you're a five spike now?" Vorden asked.

"Yeah." Borden showed off his back. "And I guess this means I can't ride on your shoulder anymore. Now that I'm as big as you."

"And you don't feel like killing us all, right?" Peter shouted over, making sure that was the critical part. "If you do, I just lost my own five spiked Dalki. We could always bring you back from the dead."

Hearing this, the others were unsure if Peter was making a joke or not. Judging by his expression, it didn't seem to be.

"Well, I'm pleased that everything went well, and you have a body of your own. You should have a special trait like the others as well. Maybe you can help out in this war a lot." Vorden smiled.

"I think he can help out now," Logan said, turning around and taking something off his back. They could all see it was a portable teleporter once he set it up.

"I tried to get in contact with Sam, but he's not responding. This is making me slightly worried that there could be something serious going on at the moment at the settlement. Who knows what happened while we were here.

"But before we go, we need to destroy the whole lab; we need to make sure that they can't use any of this machinery. We are close to concluding this war....but if we don't end it now, we have to make sure there is no chance of them ever coming back from this again."

Logan and Borden went back into the laboratory. There was a room filled with the energy of the demon tier beast, and at the same time, plenty of crystals they could use. With the use of his powers and knowledge, it was pretty easy for them to make sure the lab would blow up.

"Whoa..so you can really do that?" Borden asked in amazement.

"Not just that..we are going to destroy this whole Dalki base planet...Borden, there was something that I didn't say to the others...and it's about you..." Logan paused there while the two of them continued inside the lab.

"I know...my life span...it's still short, right? I still only have a few years to live like the other Dalki. You don't have to say anything, I can tell, and destroying the lab, killing the demon tier beast completely rather than finding a way to heal me, is the right choice. I just want to enjoy the rest of my time with my brothers.

"I really thank you from the bottom of my heart that you have allowed me to help fight side by side with them again."

Logan felt guilty in a way, but he was glad that Borden understood. However, maybe if they could find someone strong enough to take out the demon tier dragon without loss of innocent lives, Logan would have time to work on the way to increase Borden's lifespan.

But he reckoned the Dragon they had fought today was around a quarter of its regular strength, and he was sure it would have been a nightmare to fight the real thing. After getting to the lab, Logan began to set up bombs in the lab using the devices around him.

The idea was to set off a strong enough explosion where it went deep down, reaching the core. It was easier to do because the planet was an artificial one in the first place. Logan could see the less dense areas, and it was easy for him to create a hole in the centre.

Once he had placed the bombs, it was time for them to head back. Logan could see them all waiting but still weak and tired, standing by the teleporter.

"We don't know what the vampire settlement is going to be like," Logan said. "We really don't...and I know you are all weak and tired...but this is the last leg. This is the last attack force of the Dalki, and then there is only Graham left."

Although Logan spoke these words, he kept his great discovery to himself. Right now, they didn't need to know what they could be running into once reaching the other side.

After Longan pressed a few buttons on his strange bio-mechanic arm, the teleporter jammer was disabled, and it also set off the bombs. Simultaneously, the group began to jump through the teleporter heading back to the vampire settlement to see what state it was in.

*****

# Chapter 1552 - The Last Dalki Mother Ship

The lab exploded as everyone left through the teleporter, and it continued until it reached the central core of the planet, where the Dalki created a special device to keep all of the different terrains together.

On top of that, it was powered by crystals and thanks to the new type of crystals they had received, Logan was able to create powerful explosive apparatuses.

In the next second, the core was destroyed, but the explosions didn't cease, and the different terrains began to break off from each other. The powerful force made them drift apart as they slowly turned into nothing in the endless space.

All of the Dalki motherships that were on the planet were gone. And with this, all the Dalki motherships that had gone out to attack those in the beast planet solar system had also vanished. Now there were only a few stray dalki ships and one Dalki mothership left, which was heading to the Daisy faction.

After Sam and the vampire leaders had split up from the others to head back to the Daisy planet, they reached only to witness an ongoing battle between the vampires and the Dalki.

The final battle in this war wasn't between Humans and Dalki; instead, it was between the vampires against the Dalki - it was between the creators versus their creations.

———

Before the other arrived, The knights that had been left behind were in charge of their respective families, but rather than coop up in their castles instead, there were forces outside the settlement.

Many forces were on top of the wall, and they had already set up the defence mechanism.

What was a little strange was the vampires were expecting them to somewhat attack from above. For the mother ship itself to hover and send out forces or, rather, a mixture of space and land battle, but they did no such thing.

A few hundred metres away from the settlement, the mother ship landed in the meadows, crushing the grass and flowers underneath it. The Dalki army began to descend from the ship, all of them being three spiked and four spiked Dalki, and numbering around a hundred, then there was one humanoid Dalki, who looked to be the leader of this Dalki force.

Unlike the reports so far, though the humanoid Dalki looked quite different compared to the rest, which would have made it obvious if they had a special trait, this one, however, looked like a regular Dalki.

It was just as tall as the others, and its arms, tails and other features were also identical to the Dalki around it. Only the head and the body looked human, making it easy for others to differentiate it from the other Dalki.

None of the vampires recognised what human the Dalki was based on, but that didn't matter. It was clear now why they had decided to land away. The Dalki were gathering their forces because they had most probably received the reports as well.

Now, the Dalki couldn't just charge in and attack one by one like they felt like they could in the past. They were going to spearhead and attack the Shelter together.

"The leaders said that they would be coming back soon!" Silver shouted to the other vampires. With her brother being one of the Royal Knights and her being stronger than most knights, she took charge of the whole force.

"However, are we really such a group of beings that need to rely on a select few vampires? They are attacking our home! Our king warned them to try and take on this place, and he stated that this place was unbeatable. So let's prove his words right!"

The vampires weren't tense even without their leaders. Instead, they stood confident, ready to fight. Not only because of their own powers but also because of the wall itself, which was filled with countless towers and statues on the outside.

Looking out, Silver saw the humanoid Dalki raise its hand, and that was the signal for it all to begin. The Dalki's began to rush forward in a somewhat tactical position. As the fodder and shield of the group, all three spiked Dalki were at the front, while the four spikes were right behind them.

They continued to run, and the vampires did next to nothing. Their blood powers couldn't reach that far. However, this didn't mean they were planning just to stand still until the Dalki's stepped into their range.

"What is that?" One of the Dalki said, and they could all see it. The towers at the front, which surrounded the walls, all began to light up and immediately started to fire out towards the Dalki. A large explosion of beast energy, more potent than any blast from a ship that the Dalki's on the battlefield had ever faced. It crashed into the middle of them.

The blast wasn't enough to kill the three spikes, but it was clearly affecting them, as they were hurt, and a few were even bleeding due to the heat and force. The towers began to light up again as they were getting ready to fire once more.

"Push forward! we have already gotten this far!" The Humanoid Dalki leader shouted.

"Are the Dalki really this stupid? I wonder why we were so worried about them in the first place..." Silver thought upon noticing this.

As the Dalki somewhat injured and moved on, the gargoyle statues suddenly began to break free from the wall and soon leapt, only to crash into the forces.

On the other hand, as the Dalki also got within the range, the vampires began to unleash their blood powers and continued to fire it at the incoming Dalki, making sure none of them got too close.

Still, these Dalki were strong, and they managed to get through despite all of the firepower. Soon it was time for Silver, along with her knights, to make their move as well. They leapt from the top of the tower and landed on the surface, adding themselves to the strong force of around three hundred vampires already fighting at the scene.

She saw a Dalki almost punching one of the vampires, but on her way down, she wrapped her string around its arm, stopping it, and then pulled on it while moving her forward and stabbing the Dalki on its right side of the chest.

It wasn't dead, and it was hard for her to pull out her sword, but eventually, she did, and the green blood of the Dalki gushed out. Raising the sword closer to her lips, she soon licked it, which in turn increased her strength even more.

"We can win this fight without our leaders…we will prove to them that this is something we can handle without them." Silver cried.

The fight was tough, for the three spiked Dalki were nearly a similar strength or stronger than the knights they currently had. If it weren't for the fact that they outnumbered the Dalki, had the tower and gargoyles for support and lastly, that the green blood of Dalki empowered them, they perhaps would be miserably losing the fight.

But at this moment, the fighting was somewhat even and balanced. The vampires lost three times as many forces as the Dalki, but because the number of individuals on both sides had a huge difference, it looked like both sides were evenly matched on the battlefield.

During the fight, the humanoid Dalki hadn't done much apart from occasionally turning his head and looking at the mothership as if he was waiting for something or someone.

"If nothing changes..we will win this battle." The humanoid Dalki mumbled to itself.

However, at that moment, something did change. Turning his head, he witnessed a vampire leap from the wall and just as it was about to land, it suddenly threw some of its blood and it immediately exploded hitting the Dalki below.

Another one falling from the wall wrapped itself in a cape, blocking a Dalki's hit, and then stabbed it through the chest, killing it on the spot. Then, another grabbed one with red blood string and flung them over to the other side.

"It's..the leaders!" Silver smiled, happy to see the father and the rest of them. Not all the leaders were there. A few had perished in the war, and while a few were on another battlefield, like Jake and Vincent. But this was the boost the vampires needed to lean the balance of the battle on their side.

*****

# Chapter 1553 - Dalki Trump Card

A group of people were heading towards the vampire settlement where the current battle was taking place. They were currently travelling via spaceship rather than teleporter. It wouldn't be long till they arrived anyway, and there was another reason why Sam had decided to travel via ship.

"Have we had any match of Dalki energy readings apart from that on the vampire settlement?" Sam asked for a report from his team.

"No, I'm sorry, Sam. I know you're trying to find Graham, but we can't find him anywhere." Chucky replied. "The last time we heard of him and knew his whereabouts was when he was facing Sunny. The vampires who had left the planet have returned, and this is what they had to report."

They were now seeing the video footage on the screen, captured by the small combat ship. Rokene had left Sunny behind as per her instructions, but in the end, it was too much for him. He felt guilty and convinced his partner to turn the ship around and try to save Sunny.

However, all they could see was what Sam was looking at now. It was a destroyed wasteland, a giant crater in the floor that looked like it had caused a nuclear bomb, but the strangest thing in the video was the subclasses. There were no signs of the subclasses anywhere, just their blood, and there was no sign of Sunny's body either.

"Where did all the bodies go… I don't understand. Did Graham eat them, like he ate his own people?" Sam asked, not expecting an answer.

"We aren't sure, but at the moment, we have to presume she's dead. The energy reading device that was placed on the planet was destroyed as well." Chucky added to the report.

It wasn't as if Sam believed they could beat Graham, but maybe they could slow him down. Sam knew that they needed to finish that fight; if Graham joined, the whole settlement could be done for. On top of that, the report from Quinn's side told them the latter was still not done yet.

'I'm sorry to say this, Quinn, but what the f*ck are you doing?! So many people have died in this war. What was the point of you getting this crystal if you were just going to be out of the whole war?' Sam inwardly said to himself, nearly pulling out his hair. It was the first time he had criticised Quinn like this, even if it was in his head.

The toll of the war was getting to him; they had a tough time, and they were getting close to the end, yet even after everything they had done, he still felt they needed to rely on Quinn more than ever.

While in the middle of these thoughts, Sam suddenly received an update from Logan. He informed Sam about his discovery in the lab. His eyes lit up, and he was at a loss for words. Turning around, he began to give out instructions.

"Alright, stop this search; we have to head straight back to the settlement. We have to help them now before it's too late."

———

Somewhere in the vampire solar system, on a swampy-like beast planet, a group of vampires stood exhausted, encircling a region, and facing outwards. Fighting against the beasts was easy to do, but with how many were coming towards them, even they couldn't imagine.

Beasts were piling up on top of each other, floating in the water. They had killed so many that the other beasts would have to leap over the bodies or tear through them if they wanted to continue to attack the vampires by the ship.

Still, thankfully the fifth and fourth family, with these two groups, could rest, and as for the engineers, they had finally fixed the ship. Even the beasts were now decreasing in number.

"I feel like we might have just killed every single beast on this planet." Earl Ronsten stated, and it really did seem that way, as finally, after a claw hand had gone through a beast's head, the last one in the area had fallen. The only one that was still alive was the beast Jesk who had been helping them out the whole time.

As if to signify their victory, Jesk started to pound on his chest with all of his arms and roared as loud as he could. The question was, what do they do next. Most boarded the ship, while others stayed outside to protect it. They were being watchdogs in case there were any more beasts in the area.

The last thing they wanted to happen was the engine get destroyed just after the engineers had repaired it. Now, all the viscounts and Earl Ronsten was looking at Quinn, who sat in the middle of the ship's command centre.

"And… he's just been like this the whole time?" Viscount Norvic asked.

"No, there were a few times when I came in here, and he was shrieking with pain. I could see it; his body was changing going through something. I don't know what, but my guess is it's something to do with the nest Crystal." Ronsten replied. "The thing is, the glow around, and the energy is greatly diluted. Whatever he was doing, it's finally closing to an end."

With this, the group had made the decision. It was time for them to head back to the vampire settlement. They doubted that just movement of the ship would disturb Quinn, and the vampires were bound to be attacked by now.

Besides, if Quinn wanted a way to go back to the others quickly, he always had his shadow, but there was one thing on which others had no confusion about...he was almost done with whatever he came here for.

——

On the Daisy Planet, the battle continued, and with the leaders now joining the fray, it looked like the vampires were finally getting the Dalki upper hand. However, there was a problem. Of course, just like with every Dalki, the more they were injured, the stronger they got and the more they would fight back.

In the first place, they had sent out most of the best fighters among the vampires for the war, so they had lost a good amount of their forces. On top of that, they themselves were pretty exhausted. By continuously fighting, using their blood powers and abilities, they had pushed their bodies to the limit once already, and they were doing it again now, exponentially increasing the risk of draining out.

Although they tried their best not to show it, it was clear something was going on. Then, though, the strangest thing had happened.

The humanoid Dalki turned around and started to run back, and in the next instant, the rest of the Dalki followed. They were running back towards the ship.

"What should we do? Should we follow and attack? We have the advantage." Silver asked.

"No," Lee shook his head. "It could be a trap with stronger forces or maybe even self-destruction of the ship. It's not a good idea to follow. Also, we need to recover and gather the vampires' bodies who have sacrificed their lives in this battle.

Looking around, that's when Silver noticed that the leaders themselves were exhausted. It was the first skirmish, and it looked like they had killed around a third of the Daliki forces, while the vampires' attack force had also taken around the same, percentage-wise.

A moment later, a ship they recognised appeared from behind had begun to land. Descending from the ship were Sam and Vincent, along with them were reinforcements. Since the humans of the Cursed faction were sent away, there were only the group of fifty or so vampires from the tenth family as reinforcements.

As the two got out of the ship, the leaders and others were quick to greet Sam. Seeing them some of the vampires were concerned because not seeing thier leaders arrive with the others, they thought that maybe they would have come with Sam.

"I don't see the first family leader anywhere? Where is Nicu?" A Vampire asked.

"Now is not the time for that!" Sam shouted, and along with Vincent, he quickly rushed to get out to the field where the rest of the leaders were. All of them stared at the Dalki mothership off in the distance.

"What's wrong..what's with that look on your face?" Silver asked.

Both Vincent and Sam could see the Humanoid Dalki smiling near the Dalki ship, and they knew why.

"Everyone, prepare yourselves for battle any second now. Inform all of the vampires behind the walls - Fight for your lives!" Sam screamed at the top of his voice, leaving the vampires just to wonder what he was so concerned about.

"It looks like they are finally ready." The Humanoid Dalki smiled.

*****

# Chapter 1554 - Dalki Trump Card (Part 2)

Adapting to the situation would be what best described what the Dalki were doing at the moment. Sam was right, Graham never knew that they had planned to attack so soon and if they had done it a little sooner, the Dalki leader would have been unable to prepare the New Gen Dalki of mostly three to four spikes and the humanoid Dalki.

The combined power of the vampires and the humans was a development outside his predictions. Which is why even though the New Gen Dalki was ready, something else that Graham had planned was not.

When Logan looked at the files in Graham's server he had found another experiment. Although this one had been going on for a while it was yet to be complete. However, the most surprising thing was the fact that the location of the experiment had been moved itself.

From the main lab that was on the Dalki home planet, to one of the motherships. It was as if Graham expected them to get as far to their home planet. At least this was how Sam interpreted the action, but it was something much simpler than that.

Quinn had given Graham a challenge, stating that the vampire settlement couldn't be taken over, and the Dalki leader was willing to prove him wrong. The current experiment was on the very last Dalki ship that had headed over to the Daisy planet.

———

A little before Sam and the others had arrived, two people were in the middle of a debate, although one person seemed to have already won, since the ship was heading towards the vampire settlement already.

"We have to report on this!" Bonny shouted at Void.

After filming Sunny, Bonny and Void had relocated to one of the Earthborn faction planets. They had also filmed Longblade and the rest of the vampires reclaim the planet they were currently on.

One of the reasons they had chosen to move to this planet was to show the relation between the vampires and humans.

Unfortunately, that is where the filming had also stopped. Sam had told the reporter duo that going into the Dalki part of the beast planet solar system was too dangerous. The lives of their own people could not be guaranteed, much less that of two more civilians. Seeing how insistent he had been, Void had taken it upon himself to convince her.

The duo kept receiving good news after good news, but weren't really able to give full updates on the entire situation. This of course caused quite a bit of backlash from the online community. Asking them to film the battles like they had been doing.

The soldiers were risking their lives, and the civilians demanded to see what was happening. All of them were already praying for the success of humanity, yet getting kept in the dark was making all of them anxious. Bonny could sympathise, since they were just as blind without the occasional update.

In the end though, something like a calling had appeared. The Dalki were now attacking the human part of the Beast solar system. It was close by, not too far away, and on top of that this was the last Dalki mother ship.

Bonny felt like the people deserved to know, which was why she was already on the move as soon as she knew what was going on. There was still one question on her mind, as well as that of many others, especially from the Cursed faction.

Where was Quinn?

"Don't you think we have tempted fate too many times? Besides most of those there are vampires!" Void shouted back. "We should just go back to the others and wait for the good news."

"Are you crazy, this could be the final fight! The fight which decides humanity's fate! It's on our part of the galaxy, so no matter what we are going!"

Void knew that his protest was in vain, after all the ship had already taken off. Still, he just wanted to share his frustration. After this, he had decided himself. If this really was the final fight, then he would hang up his filming days and retire.

Eventually the ship had arrived, and the special drones they would use had appeared as well. They had caught the tail end of the retreating Dalki, which was a weird sight to behold.

"Oh…is the fight already over? It looks like we might have had some luck!" Void commented with a wide smile as he continued to film the whole thing. He was so used to it by now, that it was almost an automatic response for him.

"No, look at the film and zoom into that one's face!" Bonny shouted, still excited.

The live stream had already started, and it was the first time the public were being shown a humanoid Dalki, but the camera was able to catch what Bonny had seen perfectly.

"What is that? Is it a mix of a human and a Dalki, a Humalki?"

"That's a stupid name… and you shouldn't make it sound cute in the first place. Look how all the other Dalki are taking orders from it. It's clearly the leader, which means he could kill your arse and all of our arses any second."

"There's something that's giving me goosebumps looking at the thing as well…can you see it smiling for some reason."

————

The humanoid Dalki along with the others had retreated, because they could tell that it was ready, what they needed more than anything was more time. While the vampire leaders were preparing for what was to come, Sam was doing something else.

He had activated his Dalki energy reading device, just to confirm the group's worst fears.

"How bad is it?" Chucky asked.

Sam was on the wall of the fortress, while Vincent had gone down to join the others out front. The vampires that were injured or dead had been moved inside as they were taken in. The good thing was the group were allowed to recognise themselves.

Around two hundred strong vampires were present, gargoyles still alive with crystals of a high tier powering them. Going up against the army of seventy or so Dalki, but there was more…

"The energy reading, if we don't include what was already here, it's three times higher than the other planets." Sam explained. "It's worse than I thought."

The hatch of the Dalki mothership slowly started to open up, and walking out three Dalki could be seen, and around the world the reactions of seeing these three were dreadful.

Not only were the civilians watching the broadcast of the battle that was about to take place, but all of those that had just survived their own battles. Those that had fought in the war so far, couldn't believe it.

"How…are we meant to win this fight?" Samantha asked, and the others felt the same way.

"We have to go, we can't just sit around and wait to see what happens, even if we are exhausted." Mona said, who was with Samantha on one of the Earthborn planets.

"Get the ship ready, we're heading for the vampire settlement!" Owen shouted after seeing the three.

"Sir, you can't, you still haven't recovered and can barely move. Do you really think being there will make a difference?"

"If we don't win this battle we have lost the war, don't you understand that? Get me a ship and take me there now." Owen demanded.

The reaction from everyone in the world wasn't an overreaction at all, because of three Dalki they could see.

The one on the right figure was slightly leaner than the other Dalki, still it looked more normal than the others. It had a resemblance to one of those they had seen before, but this one had two horns.

Then there was another Dalki, with a snout larger than others, and fists that were able to carry more energy, standing to the right. Finally, in the centre, there was a Dalki with an abnormally large tail. One that would swing almost left to right as they walked out.

Each of these had five spikes on their back, but that wasn't the worrying part at all. It was the fact that in some way, they had some type of resemblance to the Dalki leaders. One Horn, Slicer and Green Horn.

"We killed them before… we just have to do it again." Vincent said to himself.

Hearing what Vincent said, standing on top of the tower Sam replied.

"Yeah…but last time they were all apart, this time there together… and some of the people that killed them are dead."

*****

# Chapter 1555 - Fight For The World

Looking through the information that Logan had sent to Sam, the tactician was aware that those weren't exactly One Horn, Slicer and Green Horn. These three leaders had already died, and there should be no way to clone them.

And indeed, Graham had done something else. Through countless testing he had attempted to find the DNA that had been used to create them. The unique DNA structure that had been infused with the Demon tier beast to create the strongest Dalki in existence.

There was a problem though, even after mixing two different sets of DNA, he had been unable to create an exact replica. It was similar to two parents having a child. Although the parents didn't change, a new child would never be quite the same as any previous ones, or subsequent ones.

Still, it wasn't as if his 'failures' had been useless. Many of the three and four spikes of the New Gen Dalki had been created thanks to Graham's desire to recreate ones that could match up in power to him.

This process killed two birds with one stone. Graham could create countless Dalki to fight against, hoping to improve himself, while trying to find those that would be as close to a match as possible.

Eventually he had succeeded… at least somewhat. Even New Gen Slicer and New Gen One Horn hadn't been born as five spikes. Improvements had been made on Graham's special healing device. One of them would break down the body, attacking it constantly while monitoring the Dalki.

Once it was on the brink of death, the container would start healing them again. This process repeated over and over. It didn't work so well on Graham, he knew he needed something else to evolve, but for the others it had worked perfectly.

Now, Dalki were walking out on the field that resembled One Horn, Slicer and Green Horn, and all three of them shared the traits of their originals.

"Leaders, we need to take out those three as quickly as we can, do you understand?!" Vincent shouted to all those on the ground. "Don't hold anything back. Treat them as monsters on the level of Laxmus!"

They all roared back in response. The next second, the Dalki army charged back in, the Humanoid Dalki from before still taking the lead. The three five spike leaders though were walking over carelessly, and just seeing this was putting so much pressure on Sam.

'Think… think.' Sam thought as he looked around him. The vampires were in the settlement, worrying, watching the broadcast that Bonny was currently showing. The walls were too high for them to see anything that was happening on the other side.

The vampires could join the fight, but would it really help them all that much? In the end, the only thing Sam could do was send an update to everyone on the situation, including to those still on the Dalki planet, as well as to Quinn.

"Everyone!" Sam shouted behind him. "This is a fight for our lives. If we win here, the war is OVER!!!"

Leaping off the wall, Sam also joined the fight.

Just like before, once the Dalki got within range, the towers started to activate and the Gargoyles joined in the fight as well. Seeing all of this, Vincent went to run past the carnage that was taking place to deal with the three behind him.

That was until the Humanoid Dalki jumped in his way. The two of them threw their fists and clashed in the centre. Vincent's strength had won out of course, pushing the Dalki back, but they were clearly annoying.

"Damn it, get out of my way!" Vincent shouted, activating his blood powers, but more Dalki were upon him as well. He was wondering what happened and where the other vampires were.

What the tenth leader was unaware of, since he and Sam had just arrived, was that the vampires were exhausted. The same was true for the leaders as well who had little use of their abilities left. They could no longer use their inner blood weapons because they had already fought before.

'After I take on this Humanoid Dalki. I'll just have to kill the other three myself.' Vincent told himself, even though he felt like it was impossible. He still had no powers, only blood aura, no Demon tier weapon either. Taking on a single one of the New Gen Dalki leaders, he might be able to fight them to a standstill… but he wasn't sure he could win… never mind three.

It was then that New Gen Green Horn's fists started to glow. They glowed with some strange energy. Watching the tower fire off, it blasted into the field of fighting. Seeing this, Green Horn threw his own fist of energy. It went right for the tower and the second it had hit the top, it exploded, crumbling it to pieces, causing it to fall.

The video footage being filmed showed the destructive power of the New Gen five spike leaders. In the middle of the battlefield itself, the Gargoyles were putting up quite the good fight, that was until New Gen Slicer swung her tail, bisecting their bodies.

They were a simple thing to cut, and eventually the crystal itself had been destroyed as well. The defences that had been built up by their King started to go down one by one. The extra defences that made them feel invincible were crumbling to the ground.

Lastly, one of the Dalki leaders started to grow in size. It grew larger and larger. A Dalki that was large enough to perhaps destroy the battlefield, though that wasn't New Gen One Horn's intention at all. He walked past all the fighting, and went directly up to the wall.

"This is your unbreakable fortress?" One Horn chuckled, as he readied his arm and threw out a punch. Hitting it, with such a force, the whole battlefield was shaking. Surprisingly, the wall managed to endure it.

Unfortunately, the giant Dalki simply continued to punch the wall, shaking the entire place. As durable as it might be, cracks were starting to appear, and it was only a matter of time until it fell.

The look on the vampire faces showed fear for the first time, as they saw a giant Dalki head towering over the wall, continuing to punch it again and again.

"No!" Sam shouted. Using his Shadow to travel away, blocking whatever stray attacks hit him. Eventually running through One Hour's legs and going through the wall, Sam had reached the other side.

"This is it." The viewers were saying. "If the vampires can't even defeat the Dalki… then how are we supposed to?"

As that was said, though, there were many people seen leaving the tenth castle, coming out. At the same time, as the ship was seen approaching, Green Horn fired off an energy blast towards it. Before it was hit, there were those that came shutting down like a rain of lightning hitting the ground.

It wasn't just Owen, but also Grim, the other members of the Blade family, Samantha and Mona.

From the tenth castle, those that had arrived were those that had just come back from the main Dalki base, their homeland. Logan, the Blade family, Layla, Jake from the vampire leaders.

Everyone had arrived.

"They all came back! That means the mission was a success! Right?!" Void shouted, feeling over the moon. Thinking that maybe they still had a chance. These were the people that had defeated them before, but Bonny wasn't so sure.

When zooming in, the camera closer to them, she could see the look on their faces. None of them displayed any confidence in this herculean task, and judging by the incoming mass of comments, the viewers could tell the same thing as well.

"I'm sorry." Sam said, standing in front of them.

All the vampires had escaped to their respective castles, while others had gone to join the battle that was going on outside.

"I can tell all of you are exhausted. You already fought with everything you had already…but if we don't get rid of these guys then they will kill us all. I'm sorry, but the world needs your strength one more time!" Sam shouted.

The others didn't say anything because they knew what they needed to do.

"Damn it… after this is over I demand a nice and long vacation… no, make it a honeymoon, paid with all expenses!" Fex complained, looking at the new One Horn in front of him.

One more large punch was made, and this time, the Dalki's hand pierced through. The next moment, the wall crumbled to pieces, and now they all could see One Horn once again. Just as everyone was ready to use every bit of strength in their body, there was a voice.

"I'm sorry… I'm sorry I took so long. You can all rest now."

# Chapter 1556 - Syncing
The two ships had left from the swampy planet, and onboard one of them was Quinn and the original crew that had come with him. Jesk the gorilla-like beast, was also moving along with them but chose to stay on the far end of the ship.

The others guessed that it was due to whatever Quinn was doing because even now, he was still going through the steps. Ronsten, who had been keeping an eye on him, knew that Quinn was most likely in the final stages. The energy previously surrounding Quinn was no longer present, but instead, Quinn himself was the one that was bursting with energy.

"We just went through the space station and are now heading towards the vampire settlement, and he's still like that? We can't join the fight if he remains in this state." Viscount Norvic said.

The Earl agreed. In the worst case, they would have to hover around the planet until Quinn was done because they had no clue what he was doing right now or whether any interruption would disturb him.

Because of this, the group agreed to wait patiently while the fifth family continued going forward. They had reached the outside of the planet, and Quinn still wasn't done with whatever it was that he was doing.

Eventually, all the vampires started to watch the broadcast shown in the settlement. It fueled their bodies with anger, and they were wondering what to do.

"We have to go help!" Norvic shouted once he saw the large three appear.

Earl tightened his fist and struggled to decide what to do, but when he turned around, he suddenly noticed that Quinn had stood up and was looking at his own arms as if they were foreign to him.

[100 per cent of the Crystal has been absorbed]

[System is In the process of being upgraded]

[..]

There were multiple messages in front of Quinn, but before he checked them all out, he wanted to know if Ray was back.

'Ray...are you there?' Quinn asked.

There was silence; it was a long shot, but he was hoping since Ray was in the system, with all the power he had absorbed, maybe it had brought a small part of the latter back.

'I am...but don't focus on me...look at the screen, you idiot. Your people, they need you right now.' Ray replied.

Looking at the screen that was in the room with them, Quinn could see exactly what was going on.

"Please update me on the situation," Quinn asked.

He didn't have time to check the system's messages as Ronsten began to relay all the information about what had transpired in the war; at the same time, Norvick was already moving the ship towards the vampire settlement as fast as possible.

First, Quinn needed to know which planet needed the most help where he should use his shadow travel. Only to find out that all of the fights had ended. He had no clue how much time had passed while he was away, and Quinn couldn't imagine the chaos.

Then, seeing the ship approaching the settlement, before saying anything else, he used his shadow travel to sink through the walls and leapt down to where the others were. Before touching the ground, Quinn allowed for his shadow to hit the floor first, making his landing soft at the same time no one had seen him arrive.

Quinn walked behind as he looked at the trouble in front of him and could see the others ahead, he could feel how tired and exhausted they were and on top of that hear Fex's words. Finally, the shelter wall crumbled.

——

"I'm sorry...I'm sorry I took so long. You can all rest."

Turning around, they saw Quinn in his blue fang armour set; the others didn't even know when he got there, but still, with what was in front of them, with what they had to face, they weren't even sure if Quinn could help them out of this one.

They wanted to cheer, ask Quinn what was happening, but each of them needed to focus on the fight in front of them.

Two cameras were currently filming, one aimed at Quinn and the other aimed at the new One Horn, who had just finished crushing the wall.

[Nitro acceleration activated.]

The next second, everyone saw Quinn disappear all of a sudden, and before anyone could react, he was directly in front of One Horn, throwing a fist out right towards the latter's head.

"No one is going to take over this settlement ever again!" Quinn screamed.

The fist soon turned into a large blood drill mixed with Qi energy. The speed that Quinn had moved at made him look like he had teleported from one area to the next. Before One Horn could even react, the blood drill exploded through his head, leaving a large gaping hole.

The five spiked Dalki's hard scales were useless, and its body slowly started to fall down. When it eventually hit the ground though, it was different to before. The whole area was covered in a black substance, that was because Quinn had already made his move out onto the field, utilising his shadow powers.

'Not a single one of you will escape.'

The other ships had landed with the rest, with Samantha and Owen coming out as they needed help but the first thing they witnessed was Quinn's show of strength.

"Did he just...kill One Horn...the thing we struggled to take out that whole time... in just one punch? but how?" Fex expressed his amazement.

The whole group rushed out to the hole in the wall to see what was happening outside. What they didn't know was Quinn had upgraded his armour set to the Demi-god level, making him faster than he was ever before. That, and with an upgraded gauntlet as well as the nest Crystal - all these things counted together, Quinn had improved a lot since the last time others had seen him. Still, they didn't realise that it was just the tip of his strength at the moment.

When heading out, they witnessed Quinn dealing with the Dalki, as if the latter were moving in slow motion, and Quinn was going to each one of them and punching under their chin, blasting their heads off.

Running forward, he threw a powerful kick, which sent one of the dalki flying back crashing into the others. A loud bang was heard as he threw out the kick and the air broke around him. Then, he would move on to the next Dalki closest to him. Each time Quinn moved from one Dalki to the next, a bang was heard as if Quinn was breaking the speed barrier moving to each one.

These weren't just regular Dalki; they were all three and four spiked Dalki that Quinn was dealing with, without even getting a scratch on him.

However, the real threats eventually started to get involved as Slicer began heading his way. She lept in the air spinning with her tail.

'I remember...when it felt like I could do nothing against you.' Quinn thought while a shadow rose from his hand, and he unleashed Arthur's sword. Running forward, he sliced right through Slicer's tail, chopping it off and making it fall on the ground underneath.

At the same time, Green Horn had fired two energy blasts towards him, but quickly spinning around, Quinn swung his sword, and a large explosion went off, destroying the energy blasts there and then.

Once again, Quinn charged in towards Slicer, who had regrown her tail, but Quinn slashed it off again before constantly hitting her across her body. Light scratches appeared all over, but they eventually got deeper and deeper.

While fighting Slicer, more of the strange energy blasts came his way, and quickly, Quinn had kicked Slicer in the head, not able to knock it off but smashing her bottom teeth, before turning around and casting his shadow and absorbing the energy blasts.

The energy blasts then rose through the ground, hitting other Dalki and killing them on the spot. When spinning back, he soon grabbed Slicer's head and held it there in place.

Her body was bloody from the wounds blood dripping from her mouth, it was clear that she didn't stand a chance, and Quinn was almost toying with her. The Dalki did become stronger after getting injured, but there is a limit to it, and it was the same Slicer because now, she had lost too much blood to make a swift recovery or a comeback.

"There's a reason why I kept you alive," Quinn said as he activated his new Demon tier weapon and started to use the energy drain active skill on Slicer—taking her energy and adding it to his.

"Is it just me...or is Quinn getting faster," Sil mentioned.

After having drained all the energy he could from Slicer, Quinn threw his fist right through her chest, activating the blood drill and piercing her body, which killed her on the spot.

Now only a few Dalki remained - Green Horn, the humanoid Dalki and around twenty odd survivors.

[System is currently syncing - 22 per cent]

The others noticed that Quinn had gotten stronger and improved after absorbing the nest crystal energy into himself, and they were right. Now, it looked like it was syncing with his body, enhancing his strength with every passing moment.

*****

# Chapter 1557 - The War Over?

There was a brief pause by Quinn after taking out Slicer. Once again, he looked at his hands; everything felt strange to him as he got stronger by the second. On top of that, even after absorbing Slicer, his body felt even more…powerful.

'That nest crystal…it changed my body.' Quinn thought. 'No, it's still changing my body.'

[System is currently syncing 34 percent]

As the percentage went up, Quinn's whole body was reacting to it; not only that, but he could see his natural base stats were improving along with it as well. Checking the notifications after absorbing the nest Crystal, Quinn noticed there wasn't much.

In fact, it would have seemed like a disappointment, but now he understood, the process wasn't complete yet. There was still more to come.

'I wonder what my body will be able to do at a hundred percent?'

The cameras were able to catch glimpses of what had occurred, but mostly all they could see was that Quinn had defeated several Dalki. Especially the large one who had destroyed the large wall but was killed by just one punch from Quinn.

They all had seen the five spikes on its back, and they all also saw the fight with Slicer, another five spiked Dalki, who too wasn't a challenge in front of Quinn's newfound strength.

"That's the cursed faction leader, right? I mean, I only saw him for a second, but he was using shadow and blood powers, so that has to be him."

"I'm not going to lie, I have never been a fan of Quinn, but right now...it might be the only thing we have."

"Was he always this strong, though? I heard the big four and leaders struggled to take on a five spike. How did he make them look so easy….is that why he was out of the fight for so long?"

"Maybe he entered one of those hyperbolic time chambers?"

"Those things aren't real, man, but whatever the case, I just hope Quinn can get rid of all the Dalki."

For the first time between viewers with the arrival of Quinn, their views weren't split. Right now, with the whole world's fate was in his hands, they were just happy that he was on his side. The world had already lost too much.

Even those that were alive were primarily young teens, yet to even join the military academy. They all knew those in the war, and they weren't stupid. They knew many of their loved ones, and even their parents had already died, which is why all of them wanted the same thing:

"Kill them all, Quinn! Kill them all!"

Watching his fellow five Spike die so quickly, the new Green Horn stepped back a bit, and it was the same for the other surviving Dalki.

"How, how can this be possible? We are five spikes, the strongest the world has to offer. Who is this person?!" Green Horn shouted. Of course, being relatively a newborn, he knew very little about the enemy in front of him.

Banging his fists together, the energy on his hands started to glow brighter than before. He was ready to constantly fire off all the power he could as if his life depended on it. He looked at Quinn in front of him, but suddenly, everyone heard a bang, in the next second, a hand appeared in front of Green Horn's face, clenching its head.

"Where is he?!" Quinn shouted, lifting his body in the air with one hand and then smashing it on the ground.

The others tried to get close, but the shadow on the ground rippled outward like a wave. It didn't quite hurt them when it hit the others, but they could feel the energy coming out of the shadow itself.

It felt just as strong as Quinn, and this was because, with all the extra power he had, he was also able to spread it through his shadow as well. Before, using so much Qi that he had in the body this way would have been damaging to him, but his body had changed, and the nest crystal with his demon tier weapon was giving him more strength.

The glow around the Dalki's hands started to fade as Quinn's fingers pierced the head of the Dalki, the pressure cracked the skull, and blood was dripping down around the edges.

"Who are you talking about?!" The Dalki screamed as if it was begging for its life. Something that many hadn't witnessed before.

"I'm talking about Graham!" Quinn shouted again.

The ripples in the shadow continued, and all of the Dalki looked like they were jumping towards Quinn.

[Nitro acceleration has ended]

Seeing this message, Quinn changed to the king's blood armour at that moment.

"Then all of you are useless to me." Quinn's armour set began to light up, and the armour drained the blood from the Dalki.

The next second, the incoming Dalki reached Quinn, and a large red aura explosion went off. It exploded from where Quinn was at and went towards all of the others around him, hitting them all one by one.

"That's..the king's armour, but I've never seen it create that big of an explosion before," Jin commented.

"Is it because of his blood aura?" Jake wondered. "Is it that strong, or maybe the Dalki blood that was infused with the armour?"

When the red aura began to fade, Quinn had switched his armour set one more time. This time, he was now wearing Arthur's blood armour on his body. The Dalki, who were closest to him, had already perished in the previous explosion. As for the one that Quinn was holding, its body looked almost burnt, with some of his limbs becoming ash.

Looking around him at the injured Dalkis, he stomped his foot, and from the black ground, arms began to arise. They picked all the Dalki and hung them in the air.

"It's strong enough to pick up a Dalki?" Vorden was shocked. He remembered when Quinn had first discovered the shadow, and now the two of them could see what it could do. Although Quinn could use the hands this way, they were always so weak that Quinn never tried to do such things.

However, the shadow was being powered with Quinn's second stage Qi energy, giving it a more solid form. The scene was a little horrid. The dark shadow hands lifted the Dalki's bodies, and the whole scene looked similar to a field of trees in a black pool of water.

The next second, seeing them all, Quinn started to raise the green blood from his fallen enemies and began to shape the blood. He made countless swords from them, similar to how a certain old man had used the blood powers before.

"I can tell from the system…many of my leaders…they've died. They fought to the end, and it was all because I asked them to." Quinn swung his hand down, saying these words, and the swords went right through the Dalkis' neck, finishing off the rest of the remaining enemies.

The shadow on the ground started to return towards Quinn, absorbed through his feet as the ground slowly became visible. Looking towards the ship, Quinn gathered his hands, his armour activated, and blood started to form.

He condensed the blood into a ball of energy, and eventually, throwing his hands out, Quinn had produced something similar to the blood cannon. Only the strike was far more extensive and stronger. As it hit the ship, the ship exploded into pieces. This mothership was definitely no longer operational, and the same could be said for whatever was inside it as well.

"Did…did we just win this war?" Bonny said with excitement.

The group walked out of the broken wall in silence, the vampires looked throughout the battlefield but stayed away from the battlefield, and they saw their king just stand alone.

[62 percent of syncing is complete]

The vampires began to cheer behind him in joy, and this reaction was spread through to the viewers who were watching as well. Many people were even hugging each other out of happiness.

"NO!" Quinn suddenly shouted aloud, empowering his voice with Qi so the others could hear. "It's not over!"

Off in the distance on a hill, near the wreckage of the mothership, Quinn saw a Dalki in clothes, stare at everything in front of him.

Graham was here.

*****

# Chapter 1558 - Humans Or Vampires?

The Dalki ship was quite away from the vampire settlement walls, and there was a large terrain of meadows and flower fields that were mostly destroyed due to the fighting happening in between. Despite this great distance, Quinn could still shoot a cannon of blood aura to a great length, far enough in the distance to destroy the large mothership.

All the others were celebrating just seconds ago until Quinn shouted at them, reminding them the war wasn't over yet. They saw Quinn walk towards the wreckage of the mothership, getting further away from the settlement.

They couldn't understand why he was heading forward because all they could see was black smoke enveloping the whole site.

But then, Bonny and Void's drones followed Quinn and continued to film everything, and that's when they saw him - the figure that was behind the smoke.

He leapt through from the other side, quickly going through the smoke. As he did, the force from the jump pushed and cleared away the smoke; even the fire was put out simply from the impact of this jump, and finally, upon landing, it crushed the ground beneath its feet.

Now they could all clearly see. A Dalki wearing human clothing and currently wore a white shirt and simple black trousers. It certainly looked strange and out of place—something unseen by the others, but those from the Daisy faction who were watching, those that had been in the countless meetings that Sam would have, knew who this was. This was Graham, the most dangerous Dalki in existence. His description was detailed to them several times in the meetings before, and now, he was standing in front of them.

"He finally appeared, and only a little after Quinn," Sam said. "The last great threat from the Dalki. He arrived even later than Quinn; I bet he's surprised at how far we were able to come while he was away…"

"Well, that's good then. Quinn can kick his arse...but I'm a bit worried about something else." Fex frowned.

They all were worried about something else. They soon saw him and Quinn facing each other on the live stream. In Graham's hands right now were two bodies.

Being held by the head, covered in blood, in his left hand was Sunny, the fifth leader. The vampires gasped as they noticed who it was. Sunny was one of the leaders, loved by both political sides - for and against the vampires ruling or protecting the humans.

She had that effect on people, and to see her in this state like so…was devastating for them. However, since Quinn stood very close, he could tell that Sunny was still alive albeit her energy was weak.

Yet this wasn't the only problem because, on Graham's other hand, he clutched a small girl that looked to be perhaps only around six years old.

"Minny!" Ruby shouted at the top of her lungs. Turning his head, Sam moved and immediately grabbed her hand before she could run out any further. Ruby had come along with Sam in his journey so far, trying to find out where her daughter was, trying to find an answer, and now, they have finally found her daughter.

"That's your daughter.. isn't she? The one that Arthur was trying to protect. She was with Graham all along, but why?" Sam frowned.

"Let me go...I have to save her! Let me go!" Ruby continued to struggle and scream, but Sam's strength far outmatched hers as a vampire.

"Please..I can't imagine what you are going through right now, but the best person that has a chance of saving her right now is already out there. You have to leave it up to Quinn." Sam tried to calm her down.

Sam's words were true - if anyone could save her, it would be Quinn, but the question was could he save her. At that moment, Graham held Minny by her head. Though she wasn't covered in wounds like Sunny was, she wouldn't be able to free herself even if she struggled or did much.

And, with her head in Graham's grasp, he could crush it at any moment.

'Since he's holding onto both of them, I can't use the shadow lock unless I take all of them into the shadow; but with Graham being who he is, is there any need for him to use hostages? What's his goal?' Quinn wondered.

"Graham? That's your name, right!" Quinn shouted out. "We have defeated the Dalki. Other than a few strays, you are the only one left. You have lost this war; there is no need for you to use them as a hostage."

Graham started to laugh at Quinn's response.

"Ah Quinn, the Vampire King and leader of the Cursed faction," Graham replied. "You know, in all of the data that Jim showed us, your name never came up in the list of those who had the even the slightest chance of disrupting his or my plans, but now Jim is dead, and as for me, well as you say I'm the only one here, but that doesn't matter.

"If I defeat you and get the demon tier beast, I can always create more of my kind. You are the problem; you are the anomaly in our plans, if I get rid of you, then all is well, and everything can continue the way it was meant to be." Graham replied.

"Then just fight me, as you said, no one else can match up to you, right? I'm the problem, then just fight me and let those go. Whether they live or die doesn't matter, the only fight that matters is between you and me." Quinn said, hoping to convince Graham somehow. Seeing that he was wearing human clothing, Quinn assumed that this Dalki was a bit more human than the others.

However, after hearing Quinn's words, just a smile appeared on his face.

"You're right, but you see, I brought these two because I thought I could make things a little more interesting," Graham explained. "I know your story; a human turned vampire. Someone who rose to the top to get a high position with the humans and eventually became king of the vampires as well.

"The odds of that happening are quite impossible. You have achieved a great feat, and because of this, you were perhaps the only person who could convince the humans and vampires to join together. You know, I even watched a lot of your broadcasts."

Graham said, looking at the hovering drones. He knew they were there but chose to ignore them, so the Livestream could pick up everything the two of them were saying.

"Every time you would appear, when you made the announcement to the whole world about the vampires, there was always the question, are the vampires really on human's side? Better yet, they would always ask if Quinn was on the human's side.

"This is without them even knowing the truth, and I wonder how many of you out there know the truth? I've heard the broadcast describe us as aliens, but that's not right at all. The Vampires created us! That's right, the reason why we exist in the first place is that vampires were the ones that made us.

"The vampires aren't helping the humans out of kindness. No, they were the ones who screwed up in the first place, and now, the humans, who are in the middle of it all, are suffering the most as the collateral damage."

Since the drones were broadcasting everything, Bonny wondered if she should cut the Livestream right now. She knew how this would make others feel, but the truth was necessary, and the people needed to know what had happened.

"Don't try to turn us against each other," Quinn shouted. "You knew about vampires, you knew where they were, yet you decided to attack humans anyway, and I saw what you did to Helen? Did you do that just because vampires created you? What did she do to deserve a cruel death like that, so stop your bullshit right now, and let's finish this."

Once again, Graham started to laugh.

"Oh, don't worry, we will, but I'm more interested in you, Quinn. You, who always stands on both sides, I want to know whose side you are on, so choose." Graham lifted Sunny, and then Minny after. "You can only save one of them, and the other will be let free. Are you on the humans' side or with the vampires? Choose."

# Chapter 1559 - I Choose...

Everything that Graham had said was heard loud and clear by the audience watching the Livestream, and now they knew that it was up to Quinn to decide the fate of the two people in Graham's grasp.

"He has to choose the human. I mean, she is only a child, right? That vampire is clearly an old woman."

"Do you really think he would? He's the king of the vampires, and if I remember correctly, that woman is one of their leaders. She's an important figure, but that girl…she's nobody. I hate to say it, but I think he might be better off picking the vampire."

"He could try to save them both, maybe this is too hard of a decision for him, and who knows, Graham might kill them both anyway."

"If he picks the vampire, then that means that when this whole crap is over, Quinn will always be on the vampire's side, not the humans. I don't care if that girl is a nobody; she's still a child."

"How many children have already died in this war? How many children have died in the past already? Do you think one more death really matters? The vampire protected us, she led the attack against the Dalki in the war, and now that little brat is just being used as a hostage, that kid is a waste of space."

Reading all the comments coming in, Bonny couldn't quite believe it. Just moments ago, while Quinn was fighting, they were all united. United and cheering Quinn on, but now Graham had caused a stir between everyone with just a few words.

"He's not just thinking about now; Graham's thinking about the future as well. He doesn't believe this will be the last fight and is still trying to pit us against each other." Bonny said.

Although Quinn had no clue what the world's reaction was at the moment, he had an idea since he knew it was all being filmed, and being put in this position, it was his job to make it clear to everyone and what action to take next.

"For me, the answer is simple," Quinn said out loud. "The vampires are protectors of Humans. We have lived in the shadows, minding our own business, and now that humans need us, we have decided to come forward.

"I'm sure that one of our family leaders will understand because I know she would have fought with her life on the line to save the child in the first place. So I choose to save the young girl." Quinn said, pointing.

Hearing this, a loud sob came from back in the settlement. Ruby was kneeling over in tears, thankful that her daughter was safe and sound, and those online were quite surprised by Quinn's decision. Most had never expected him to say this, and they were wondering if his words were true.

Were vampires human protectors and not this enemy they were made out to be?

"I see; well, that's your choice then," Graham said as he dropped Minny to the ground.

But in that second, Quinn raised his hand.

[Shadow lock]

Minny disappeared into the shadow, and just before Graham could squeeze Sunny's head.

[Summon]

Sunny also disappeared from Graham's grasp and appeared right by Quinn's side.

[Shadow lock]

Using the shadow lock again, Quinn also placed her in the shadow.

"I won't play your little game, Graham!" Quinn shouted. "I got stronger and stronger every day, just so I would never have to see any of them die again, so I chose neither!"

Quinn blasted off from his feet as he kicked the grounds beneath him. He readied his fist, creating a large drill of blood, and it continually swelled around his fist. At the same time, he mixed it with his Qi, creating a balance of blood and aura.

Seeing this for the first time, even for Quinn, something strange happened; the red blood drill had swirls of yellow energy mixing in and around it. Syncing up with the system and also taking the energy from the five spiked Dalki's had given him a boost in power.

"I see, so you seem to have chosen the third option," Graham said. "None of you will survive."

Graham looked at his fist for a second and stood there as Quinn came towards him. Then, Graham threw his own fist right towards Quinn at the right time.

When the two fist's collided, the blood drill energy had almost disappeared, and before Quinn knew it, Graham's fist slammed him with a powerful force, and his body went flying through the air. Blood dripped from his mouth, and his arm was mangled.

At the same time, the power of the punch seemed to have travelled, as it was breaking the very ground of the planet.

"Everyone move!" Sil shouted.

The vampires ran to the two sides of the settlements as the punch continued going forward. The energy slammed right through One Horn's body as if there was no resistance at all, and eventually, it had hit the King's Castle.

When it did, everyone heard a large bang, and the rumbling of the whole settlement continued as they witnessed the king's castle fall just like that in front of their eyes, and all of it happened from just a single punch of Graham.

"Everyone, take the ships and fly out of here. The ground isn't safe; the settlement isn't safe anymore!" Sam ordered.

After seeing what happened, some of the vampires agreed, while a few were hesitant.

"This is an order. Allow our king to fight on this planet without any worry." Jin shouted to them.

The vampire leaders and the Cursed leaders were going to stay on the ground. They were strong enough to avoid whatever strikes were to come this way, but they were worried that perhaps with the fight that was about to go on, the vampire's settlement wouldn't survive, no maybe the whole planet.

[Blood bank activated]

Quinn's arm began to heal, and now he knew from Graham's single punch that this wasn't a fight he could take the risk of holding back.

'The five spiked Dalki were so easy to deal with, and even the six spikes weren't this strong...could it be.'

While in the air and looking down, he could see that on Graham's back, there were, without a doubt, seven spikes.

"Do you see the number on his back…its seven spikes, a seven Spiked Dalki!"

"Quinn's body went flying from a single hit...is he even still alive?"

"Even if he is still alive, how can he win? How can he go up against that?"

Sam and the others on the ground had a similar feeling because they never imagined that Graham would have gotten this strong. Even Nate felt like he wouldn't survive if he blocked that attack with his shield in Quinn's place.

"Hahaha, I would like to thank you for giving me such a great feast by sending that woman from before. Thanks to you, I was able to get even stronger than before. Hopefully, I will grow even more once I eat you and everyone else. What's the limit of the Dalki body evolution...is it endless?" Graham wondered aloud with a big smile on his face.

Jumping from his position, Graham had destroyed the ground beneath and went to throw another fist towards Quinn.

"I'm sorry...for thinking I could beat you with just my bare hands!" Quinn shouted.

[Shadow Overload activated]

[Shadow body has been created]

A pair of shadow wings had formed on Quinn's back, and using them, he dashed forward towards Graham.

At the same time, Arthur's sword appeared in Quinn's hand. With the armour, it started to light up. Just as the two of them were about to collide, a shadow appeared right in front of Quinn and passing through it; he appeared directly behind Graham.

He then swung the sword, hitting Graham at the top of his head, causing mass explosions as the force sent the latter down, but Quinn wasn't going to stop there, as he flew with the sword aiming to pierce it right through Graham.

Just as he was about to reach the ground, though, Graham punched the sword on its side, knocking it out from Quinn's hand and skidding it across the ground. With his other hand, Graham then whacked Quinn on the shoulder and knocked him to the side as well. Graham;s punch was far quicker than the shadow.

Quinn's body went skidding across the ground side but not too far away as he quickly regained his composure. The shadow body is like having the shadow armour covering him at all times, but Quinn could still feel pain.

Something was up. Similar to Qi, Graham's hits could get through the shadow, causing him some pain, but it still had blocked most of its attack.

[70 percent of Nest Crystal has been synced.]

'With punches as strong as his, I have no clue how long this Shadow Overload skill will last, and I know this sounds crazy...but I think he's faster and stronger than me.' Quinn realised after having received two of Graham's punches.

To win this battle, he would have to rely on his skills and special powers.

[Soul weapon activated.]

[Twin tail chain]
