# Chapter 1420 - No One Left
To put it simply, Quinn was tired. He was tired of having to do so much to please these people when it seemed like there were just some people who wouldn't change their minds. The Board had a clear aim: they didn't wish for the humans and vampires to unite, they wanted them to be split apart, but there was one person the others didn't treat like a vampire.

Seeing Quinn consume the blood, the generals on the ground and some of the others looked at him with fear. Still, there were a few who didn't look at Quinn differently for a second, like Owen, his grandfather Grim and Sil.

These people were also human, but they knew what Quinn had achieved.

"I accept your gift," Quinn said. "It seems like sometimes people forget, although I was a human, I am a vampire as well. The vampire that took back the Daisy faction back from the Dalki, the vampire who saved all of the students on Planet Caladi, and the vampire who has slaughtered countless Dalki.

"That is the reality of the situation." Quinn no longer wanted to say anything else to them; thus, he slowly started to walk down from the stage. As he walked past the Board members, the Travelers wondered if they needed to fight such a person.

But after seeing his display of blood powers, many of them were reminded of the video they had watched, in which countless Dalki were killed in an instant. When Quinn reached the Board members, they took a few steps back—partially worried that their guards wouldn't be able to defend them in time.

"The only reason why I haven't attacked you or left this place is that I don't want to start a war," Quinn said. "I'll play along with this stupid game of yours, but you better keep up with your promises after this.

"Otherwise, I promise that I will personally hunt each one of you down, and this is a threat. I WILL GET RID OF whoever I see as a risk to the humans or the vampires."

Since it was quite the unexpected interruption, and things didn't seem to be going to plan, everyone was partially at a loss for words; they didn't know what to do next or what to say. Those on the Board just stood there dumbfounded, looking at each other.

There was one that was still having a good time, though, and that was Mona, who continued to stuff her face through the whole thing. She had somewhat predicted that something like this would happen.

"Maybe you could have said something if you were still around," Mona said to her big friend. "A lot of people listened to you. I wonder how much trouble this Board had caused during your reign, or perhaps that's where all the bad had come from."

The old man who had done most of the talking up till this point looked like he would fall over at any second, and so a seat was brought out, and the girls and servants were told to go away. He looked defeated and was no longer in a state of arguing anymore.

Instead, another person went to the centre, this one looking far younger, a well-kept man in his fifties with parted hair down the middle. He decided to speak because of some news that he had just received.

"I know everyone here is extremely busy, and that includes us." The man said. "So I'm sure you are all waiting just to start this event and get it over and done with. As one of us said earlier, we are true to what we said before.

"We wish to unify everyone who is against the Dalki with this event, and that's why we called the strongest people from far and wide to this place. This is why for our next set of guests, please do not be so surprised." The man finished saying.

It didn't take long for the set of double doors to open, and two figures stepped inside the room. One was a large macular man who had his body out on display, and there were scars all over his body.

One could tell straight away he had been through several battles, as for the one next to him. He, too, had a scar on his face that went across diagonally. It was so large that one couldn't imagine how a person could survive from such an attack.

The two of them walked towards one of the tables near the front that had been left empty. That's when the others in the room noticed something interesting. One of them had a large number visible on the back of their white overcoat, the number three.

"You invited agents of Pure to this?" Sach asked, who seemed to be quite annoyed. If any group had affected the military the most, even throughout the war, it was Pure.

"As I said earlier, we have gathered all the people here with one goal in our mind: to unite against the Dalki. And this includes inviting those from Pure. You may not see eye to eye in the future, but we all have the same goal." The Board member said.

"Then where have they been while Dalki attacked all of the planets?" Samantha asked. "Where were they when Oscar risked his life fighting on the front lines. I haven't even seen these two before."

For Quinn and Leo, though, it was different. They knew the muscular man every well, and it was the one known as Chris. In fact, Chris and Leo had thought of one of the four spiked Dalki together.

'So he really was working for Pure…' although Quinn already knew about this, seeing it, he felt a little saddened. Chris had helped him a lot back then, and he didn't seem like a bad person. Still, eventually, due to them thinking differently, there was a chance the two of them could clash, and Quinn was worried for another.

Leo also looked at Chris intensely, or more so, turned his head in their direction. Since the last time they had met, he could tell that Chris's Qi seemed to have improved even more. Not just what was inside his central area, but it was also burning through his strong body on the outside.

What he was witnessing right now greatly reminded him of Hilston's capabilities. There were times when Leo thought how strong Hilston would have been if he knew more about Qi and its uses, and there was possibly a person in front of him right now whose state was telling him the answer.

At least Chris didn't have an ability they needed to worry about.

"We have always been there. Our agents have infiltrated all your groups, and you surely know that. Do you think they just ran away? They stayed and fought." Chris replied.

"And what about you two, though? If you were so strong, then why haven't you fought with them directly?" Samantha asked again.

"Well, I haven't seen the Earthborn group making large feats either. Only the Graylash and Cursed faction have done something. Does that mean the rest of us in this room have been lazy about the war?" Chris replied.

After talking to Samantha, Chris decided to give Quinn a wave. It was clear it was directed at Quinn, but the latter was unsure how to reply.

At that moment, the simple gesture done by one of the Pure sent questions ringing through all of their heads. Just what was the relationship between Pure and the Cursed Faction?

A loud clap came from the Board member on the stage.

"Right, now that everyone is present, it is time that we get into our position. We shall head to the stadium, and we will commence the event." The man said.

A pair of servants opened up the doors, and there looked to be what looked like a Butler leading the way. While the Board members remained seated, everyone else left the room.

Once everyone had left and some time had passed, the old man who had had his head down stood up.

"That brat… I've never seen someone talk down to us so much before. Even Pure showed us some respect." The old man was practically yelling. He then went to another Traveler who was by his side, wielding a giant scythe.

"Don't forget - No one is allowed to know about this event." The old man said.

A few seconds later, the Traveler went behind the stage where the women were present and waiting.

*****

# Chapter 1421 - The Start Of The Strongest
Everyone was escorted through the large stadium they were currently inside. They followed the butler-like looking person, slowly making their way where they needed to be. After meeting the members of the Board, Quinn was still trying to think of ways to prevent the former from using its power to influence all these people again, like how they had done so now.

'The best thing to do is probably to get Logan to gather as much information on them. He will eventually find out where all their bases are located. Or maybe they hid all this stuff when they invited the Green family to be part of the Board.'

'It's pretty impressive that even these ten have somewhat decided to work together. With how the Board members are, I will be surprised if there is no infighting between them and one trying to topple the other.' Quinn thought.

'It's due to them feeling like they are above the rest of you.' Ray replied. 'It's actually similar to why many vampires didn't bother with the humans. Even during my time, the ruling empire had a similar situation to the current scenario. They are happy with their position, and they know only together they can do something like this. If you really want to stop the Board, you would have to either break them down one by one without alerting the other or do everything at once.'

Thinking about this was giving Quinn a headache. He never thought he would have to dabble in politics or a game of chess. Lately, he had just been using his fists to solve everything because he thought that was the type of world he was in. Where power ruled all, and now he was finding out that this wasn't quite the case.

The group soon reached the winding tunnels that would stretch all around the stadium, and here they met up with more Butlers that looked different to the man leading them so far, but all wore the same uniform.

There weren't many people here in the first place, so they were easy to spot.

"From here, You will split up into two different groups." A Butler stated. "Although this is not a team competition, we have decided to split you all into two groups. After witnessing the strength of the vampires, we wish for them to witness the humans' strength as well. I hope that is okay with you."

Again, Sam had also predicted that something like this would happen, which was why they had invited Leo and Sil. It was quite comical to Quinn that others couldn't even tell that Leo was a vampire, but he guessed the main trait, the red eyes that vampires had. One couldn't see on Leo, so it partially made sense.

As expected, the two from the Cursed faction whom the Board wanted to follow the other half of the group were Sil and Leo.

"I trust that you will look after them," Quinn said.

At that moment, two people there gave Quinn a look as if they agreed to his request; they were Owen and Sach. These two were strong people who Quinn could trust, but he was worried for Leo because the latter would be next to those from Pure, and knowing their apparent history, things might get messy. Secondly, the Unranked with the white aura was among the others as well.

Since Leo had to depart from the group, he had something important to mention to Quinn before he left. He leaned in, whispering in his ear; it was so quiet that only the vampires could pick it up. With that, Leo left a piece of critical information in the hands of Quinn.

After following the butlers, they went down different ways in the tunnels, and after a long walk, they exited and found themselves in the stands, inside the large glass see-through containers.

Peering out, one could see the stadium ground distinctly, which was a generated map. It would display what was currently transpiring inside the VR game for the others to see, and inside the giant glass containers was a VR pod.

In total, there were four of these glass containers. Quinn and his twelve vampire leaders were in the east block. This was because Quinn still hadn't brought back the eighth family fully yet, so he could not summon a leader, and one hadn't replaced Muka. Of course, the fourteenth castle, in a way, also belonged to Quinn now, as leader of the Punishers.

In the north container, it looked like the Board members had arrived. There were special seats for them but none for the others, but what each container did have was servants that would get them what they wished if need be.

The south container was empty, and then there was the west container; it was meant to contain the strongest humans, even though a couple of vampires were mixed in there.

"Wait a second," Jake said as he looked at the other side across from them. "They have more people than us; there are a total of eighteen on their side while we have thirteen and that includes Quinn."

"Wow, I'm glad that the 6th family still seems to teach basic mathematics." Sunny chuckled. As an older leader, and Jake being considered quite young for one, the older leaders could get away with things like this without sparking a fight.

"About the question you mentioned." One of the Butlers guiding them so far started to speak while standing next to the VR capsule. "We do wish for Quinn to take part in this as well. There also might be some of you who will be required to fight more than once.

"Since we will be using the game for combat, you wouldn't suffer from fatigue or injuries like that in a normal fight."

Hearing this, Quinn wondered how he would fare. According to Logan, the machine could not copy blood weapons, so using Arthur's weapon was out of the question and the same for the armour. Also, although Quinn could use the shadow powers, he wouldn't be able to access his dimensional space for quick equip as he could do in real life.

So the only thing that would work would be his beast armor set, his right gauntlet, and whatever beast weapon he registered. Whether he would fight or not was a different story as Quinn thought back to what Leo mentioned before he left.

When Leo leaned in, he had some surprising news to pass.

"I couldn't tell you before because I couldn't sense it until they came in. But the man next to Chris, with the large number three on his back, his aura is slightly different as well. Inside, I see a hint of red, a colour I have only observed on beasts."

Quinn had learned that the Pure was trying to make some type of hybrid similar to the Dalki. The thing was, the Dalki were more beast than humans, which was perhaps why they had this initial instinct to hunt and kill humans.

Did this mean that Pure was actually successful? Or was it something else to do with the said person's powers? Either way, Quinn didn't like it, and he didn't fancy the fact that Pure was here either.

Still, Leo had even more to tell.

"On another note, there seem to be traces of Qi surrounding each of the Board members' heads. It doesn't feel like any of the board members practice Qi because the presence inside them feels foreign; this might be an advanced usage of the third stage of Qi.

"Some way to transfer it over to another, while not harming the person, then using it like the second stage for protection."

It didn't take long for Quinn to figure out what Leo was hinting at. Only one group could use Qi and understood it better than Leo himself, and that was the Pure. With their arrival, perhaps this wasn't a trap set up by the Board, but all of Pure and they had just caught the strongest ability users all in one place.

'Maybe it's best if I do some investigating, but how do I get out of this place without them knowing I've left…' It was then that Quinn looked over to Vincent, who still used the mask to cover his face and an idea dawned upon him.

——

"The event will now begin; please look at the screen above. It will randomly present two opponents from each side." A Board member said.

The pictures of the contestants shuffled through at an amazing speed. This was all information that Logan had provided them, and Logan would soon be called himself as well.

Finally, the pictures had stopped.

"We have Jin Talon from the fourth family, going up against Owen Graylash from the Graylash family!"

It seemed like the event was kicking off with a bang.

*****

# Chapter 1422 - Switching Places
Now that the participants for the first match had been selected, they still needed to get everything ready. Another butler entered the scene and pushed a teleporter towards the centre of the stadium. After that, he input some codes before a message was sent out to none other than Logan.

'I wonder how the others are doing?' Quinn thought as they all waited for something to happen. 'Depending on whether Pure is actually the one behind all of this, I might need to call them all in. I just don't get what they could possibly gain. Do they plan to take us all out at once? Surely, they can't believe that they alone could stand a chance against the Dalki…'

A few seconds later and one of Quinn's closest and shortest friends came out from the teleporter. The butler proceeded to inform Logan of what the Board wanted him to do and handed him what looked like a nano chip.

Normally one would need a computer of some sort to read the files on the portable storage device, or they could just send the information required for the game to where it was needed, but this was an important event. However, with Logan around there was no need for a computer either.

'They really seem to have put a lot of money into all of this. With how soundproof the containers are, I can't hear a word of what they're saying.' Looking up though, Quinn could see that there were speakers prepared, which most likely would be used to emit the game noise, so the experience would be more real than simply watching the fight.

Quinn was partially worried about what would happen if he tried to leave the place. It would mean the vampire council would remain stuck in one room together. Still, since they would be using the gaming pod, technically they shouldn't have to leave the room, meaning they could help each other if a problem was to occur.

He couldn't imagine anyone strong enough to take on the whole vampire council, unless Laxmus or Graham themselves were to suddenly appear.

After touching the nano chip, Logan placed his hands on the ground. He himself was able to pass on the information that had been gathered by the others. He was checking it thoroughly to make sure there was nothing wrong with it.

Going one step beyond, he also checked the arena to verify that there were no problems there either, and since the arena was connected to the VR pods in each of the rooms he could also check if they had done anything funny to any of them.

Given his ability the entire process had barely taken any time. However, just in case he might have overlooked something, Logan also accessed any other services and devices in the vicinity that the VR pods had been connected to. Nevertheless, after all of that, he had been unable to find anything, so he imported the information from the two sides.

'Have they really just invited all these powerhouses to set up a VR game tournament…well I made the updates, and everyone's information was recorded up to a week ago. It should be 99% as accurate as a real fight without the pain.' Logan thought.

Looking at the glass containers, he gave a thumbs up to all three sides, telling them it was all okay for them to continue. This came as a relief to Quinn and he decided that now was the time for him to put his plan in motion.

The butler looked a bit helplessly at the vampires since he was unaware who exactly Jim Talon was. It hadn't been too long that humanity had been informed about the vampires' existence and it had been much shorter that the vampire leaders had appeared. As such, the only one he recognised was Quinn. Noticing the older man's problem, Jin came forward and proceeded to get in the VR machine.

"Are you familiar with how it works?" The butler asked politely.

"Yes, we have them where we come from as well." Jin answered and quickly got into the capsule, closing the lid. The same thing appeared to be happening on the other side as well. The current technology they were using now was a mixture of the game Powerfighters and what they had seen at the military base when Fex had fought in a Mech.

With Owen and Jin in the VR pod a random map was being selected, filling up the stadium and giving them the two an arena to fight. The stage, a small deserted village, was being formed in front of everyone. The ground was a dry yellow with several houses out, and then across the centre was a wooden bridge that had been placed over a flowing river.

If the bridge was to be cut, it didn't look like it would do any damage, nor did the river flowing beneath it look too deep. The place looked kind of peaceful and strange for a fighting arena. Still, on either side of the bridge, at the end of the village the two figures materialised.

While everyone's attention seemed to be on the virtual arena ahead of them, Quinn decided to enter his Shadow space quickly using the Shadow lock skill on himself. However, he had also brought someone along with him. If the Board had placed any hidden cameras in their room, he would just have to hope his little trick would deal with the situation anyway.

"Vincent, I don't trust this whole situation. There seems to be more going on behind the scenes than we first thought, but I'm sure you've felt it anyway." Quinn said. Hearing this, Vincent nodded along, he was naturally curious and paid close attention to any new situation, a characteristic he had taught his descendant.

"First, I need you to take off all your clothes, the armour, the mask, everything. We don't have much time, and make sure you break your hair up so it's like mine again." Quinn ordered.

There wasn't much time to explain and the longer they were away, the more suspicion and attention they would attract.

Next it was time for Quinn to use the Summon skill.

[Summon]

His target was the only person who hadn't accompanied them. As soon as he used the skill, a figure appeared before him with his trousers down and a golden yellow stream could be seen coming out of his other end.

"What the f*ck? Where the hell am I?" Fex cursed, seriously annoyed, quickly pulling up his trousers and turning red faced as he looked at Vincent and Quinn. "Come on, Quinn, you gotta warn your brother before pulling such a stunt! What if I had been in the middle of doing… something else!!!"

Quinn had tested the Summon skill a few times before so he knew it would work, but he had no time to inform Fex of this impromptu plan.

"What happened? Did that whole meeting go wrong? Fex asked.

In his rush, Quinn could see that his trousers had been a little stained, but it would have to do.

"I need you to put these clothes on." Quinn told him, without any further explanation.

Casting a shadow over himself, Quinn changed his outfit into the Blood armour set, while temporarily giving the Blue Fang set to Vincent. A shadow was cast over the two and his ancestor now looked identical to him.

"Hey, couldn't you have done the same for me? Why am I the one that had to get undressed and dressed!" Fex complained, as he was in the middle of putting on Vincent's discarded clothes.

"I'll look after your clothes." Quinn assured him, placing them in his dimensional space. "For now, we need you to pretend to be Vincent, while he will pretend to be me. When Vincents enters the capsule, the game should recognise him as me, since we both share the same body.

"But for you Fex, you'll have to get Logan's attention first. He should be able to help you pass as Vincent. I'm sure of it. Anyway, we've spent too long in here. Good luck." Quinn said.

Kicking all three of them out of the Shadow lock, while Quinn immediately used his Shadow travel to get out of the room, leaving the rest up to the others.

'Now, let's see what they are hiding.' Quinn thought, heading towards the canteen as his first destination.

*****   

# Chapter 1423 - Unexpected Outcome
While using the Shadow Travel, Quinn made his way to the room they were in before to see if cameras were set up in there or perhaps someone else watching them from another room.

'I thought you would have stayed a while at least before going off and investigating.' Ray said. 'Aren't you worried about the one that might have a god lingering in his body?'

'Of course, I am.' Quinn replied straight away, 'But in a time like this, I have to think about what is more important. If I were to gamble, I would say that the Unranked aren't involved in this. Most likely, he has nothing to do with Pure, and even now, there's a chance Pure isn't behind this, and the Board members just had some protection placed on them by someone else.

'But I decided to bring the vampires here, so they are my responsibility, and I have to make sure that they will all be safe.'

——

The scene in front of everyone was quite astonishing. They couldn't imagine how many materials and the cost to make something so advanced like this would be. Still, if one group of people had the money and the items, it would be the Board Members.

Looking down at the fighting field below them, they could see every detail, including those in the game itself, and it seemed so real to them all.

"We have the technology to create something like this; how come we never did?" Katori, the second leader asked.

"Because it is a waste, and it's not how we do things," Nicu replied. "In the first place, people can dive into the game, so why waste a large space like this, and if you want to find out who is stronger, instead of a game, why not use the real thing?"

Some of the leaders actually agreed with Nicu for once, as they were used to the real-life battles.

"And if you were to kill one of the humans by accident, or worse yet, what would happen if they were to kill one of us. That would definitely cause a rift between the two sides, Which is not what Qu- what I want." Vincent said as he took over his new role as Quinn.

He didn't tell everyone about Quinn's plan, and the only ones aware of it were Vincent and Fex. Although they couldn't tell the difference between Vincent and Quinn, the leaders knew that something was up.

Still, this was more because they felt that 'Vincent' was not being himself. This was because it was Fex. They could smell he was different because Fex was still at the rank of vampire noble. Yet, he held a higher position than them, which made the leaders shake their heads significantly.

"So, does anyone want to bet how long it takes Jin to beat the human?" Jake asked.

"How do you know that he will win?" Muka inquired.

Hearing his words, a few of the leaders couldn't help but chuckle a bit. They had met humans before, and those humans couldn't even deal with the threat of the Dalki. On top of that, Jin was actually a strong fighter.

"You all might be surprised today," Vincent said, looking out. "Humans aren't that weak."

——

The match had begun, and the two participants stood opposite each other, around two hundred meters away. It was twice as large as a football field.

'Since it's a game, I'm sure Quinn won't mind me showing off my skills a little too much." Owen chuckled to himself, closing his fan and realigning his face. He then held the fan outwards and pointed towards Jin.

"He's pointing at me, from that far? Well, first, I needed to figure out what his ability is and then go from there. If I remember the reports correctly, the Graylash family had the power of…" Before Jin could finish his thought out loud.

A blue lightning bolt came straight his way, directly at his head. Seeing this, Jin lifted his hands, swiping out a red blood aura strike. Since they were so far away, Jin never thought his opponent would be able to strike from so far away, never mind so fast.

When the lightning strike hit the red aura, it smashed directly through it and continued advancing.

'The lightning attack is stronger than my blood aura?!' Jin was stunned and immediately rolled out of the way, trying to avoid the strike.

"That won't work." Owen smiled and flicked his fan to the left. At that moment, the lightning bolt stopped for a second, levitating in place. Then, as if it was striking again from its position, it went straight out in a line, right towards Jin again.

"Damn it!' Jin shouted and quickly bit the tip of his fingers. If his Blood aura weren't enough, he would just have to use his main ability, flicking his hand blood left his fingertips, the blood hit the strike and explosions proceeded in one big bang.

Jin had covered the front of his body with Blood Hardening, just in case of two things - The lightning bolt was still strong, and secondly, to protect himself from the explosion since it was so close. When the dust settled, the lightning bolt was no longer there; his attack had worked.

'Hmm, so just like on the video, vampires seem to have abilities as well, and it's quite the strong one if it was able to cancel out my lightning strike.' Owen thought as he started to run forward.

'His abilities are strong. These are meant to be the strongest humans, so I shouldn't have underestimated them. Still, his movements look to be slow, so I'll just have to attack him head-on.' Jin thought, running ahead as well.

It looked like both of them were heading towards the bridge that was placed in the centre, but Jin was moving at a much faster speed. Owen did have trails of lightning coming out from his foot that allowed him to run fast but not as fast as his opponent.

'It's a shame that I can't use my soul weapon in a place like this. I guess it means I can't go all out, but from the look on his face, it's possible that the vampires know nothing about us, and maybe I can use that to my advantage.' Owen thought.

It was true that they couldn't use soul weapons in this battle, and it was still something that Logan could not replicate in the game quite well. He could create something similar, but the way it worked and how unique a soul weapon was to the user, it was an incredibly hard task. Still, the vampire couldn't use blood weapons or their inner blood weapons either.

Jim's blood weapon, the shield he would rely on, had been destroyed in the fight against Laxmus.

Jin had reached the bridge first, and his fingertips were still dripping with blood, ready to use his ability. At the same time, he wanted to get close to using more of his blood powers and had one of his hands encased and hardened with blood. Just in case the human had anything else up his sleeve.

Jin was about halfway across the bridge when Owen had taken his first step.

'A straight path with nowhere to run. Now you are just making this too easy for me.' Owen thought as he took one step on the ground, then lifted both of his legs, and lightning shot out from the bottom of his feet.

At the same time, he spun his body as fast as he could, and lightning started to emit from all over his body. This motion turned his body to practically a human-sized lightning bolt, and it was just as fast.

The sudden burst of speed whacked right into Jin, he placed his hand in front of his body, but it was useless, as he was struck right in his centre. The next second, Jin's body was sent flying back through the air, back to where he had come from.

Making all the vampires watching from above speechless.

"Yes!" The board members shouted. "Show them the power of the humans!"

This was not what they had expected the fight to go like so far.

——

Meanwhile, Quinn had decided to come out from his Shadow travel and began walking around the place. At the same time, he used his shadow cloak, which would make him practically invisible and hard for the cameras to pick him up if there were any in the first place.

Eventually, Quinn had arrived at the canteen where the meeting had taken place. It looked the same as before, but there was a large smell of blood, more so than before.

'No…' Quinn thought.

*****

# Chapter 1424 - Using The Game
Jin had received an enormous blow, and the others in the audience thought that perhaps this was the match's conclusion. After all, the Graylash family was known as the family with the strongest ability in existence.

Yet, Owen had a strong intuition that the fight wouldn't be this easy. He was already charging forward, seeming to go off from the bridge.

A few seconds later, before he could reach the end, several explosions went off, collapsing the whole area around him. It wasn't just one set of explosions where Owen was, but ahead and behind him as well. There was clearly nowhere for him to run, and smoke from the explosions covered the whole area.

"I'm surprised that Jin felt that he needed to be this cautious." Sunny commented. "When running across the bridge, he must have let his blood drop on certain parts on purpose. This also means that Jin is perfectly fine; he must have made use of the time when his opponent was moving towards his half of the bridge."

Jin was one of the leaders who fought more using his head rather than relying on just strength; Sunny was surprised that he had decided there was a need to fight like this. Most likely, after witnessing the lightning go through his Blood Aura, Jin knew this fight would be harder than he imagined.

In the water, Owen was standing, submerged in it up to his waist, but the current wasn't strong enough to take him downstream. Still, his body didn't look in the best shape, with scorch marks everywhere.

"I guess this time I was the fool," Owen said to himself. "I forgot that this was a game, which means recovery from attacks is quicker than it would be, and…I didn't expect that."

Jumping up, Owen struck out lightning from his feet a few times. He wanted to use it to give him an extra boost, and if he kept the stream constant, it could also give off the appearance as if he was levitating in the air.

Eventually, he had arrived back at the village. At the half where Jin had started initially, but what was worrying him more than anything was the fact that he couldn't see his opponent anywhere.

'Oh, has he chosen to hide? Didn't think the vampire's pride would allow them to do such things?' Owen thought.

Seeing this, he decided that it wasn't best for him to stay out in the open and headed back to one of the huts. He stayed there for a few seconds, planning his next move until explosions went off once again, and this time it was in the Hut itself.

Not letting the explosion damage his body once again, Owen jumped up in the air and spun his body, turning himself into a large lightning bolt. It shot him quickly away from the Hut and back in the open.

He couldn't stay in such a form for long, but it was a good skill to use for a burst of movement. Originally meant to be an attack move, he had no choice but to use it defensively.

'Are all of the Huts booby-trapped with explosives, but then how did he know where I was?' Owen started to think. It was then that he noticed something; despite everything around him being virtual reality, he could smell the burning of Hut.

'Sense of smell, don't tell me…'

Logan had upgraded the game to be more impressive once again. He was emulating the sense of smell into the VR machines and their brains even though he didn't know how Humans smelt to the vampires.

But Logan could make humans give off a smell that wouldn't be smelt or detected by the humans but would greatly help the other side. Logan wanted to make it so the vampires were as close as possible to their original selves in this fight.

"I never thought that a vampire would resort to tactics like this. Where is your pride? Fight me one on one and prove your strength!" Owen tried to taunt his opponent. He wasn't sure that it would work, but he was a little annoyed himself.

However, what was most surprising, he could soon see a vampire in front of him, throwing out droplets of blood.

"You vampires are fast; I may not be as fast as you, but my ability is a different story." A lightning strike rose, and Owen was no longer in front of Jin.

He suddenly appeared behind Jin and launched another strike, hitting him on his back.

It forced Jin down to one knee as he felt the shock throughout his body.

'This power is annoying, but I can stop it!' As he focused his blood aura, Jin thought to harden the spots where the lighting strike was attacking him.

It allowed him to turn around, and he charged forward once again. Owen stopped his attack and was ready to move away again, but this time, his arm was grabbed before he could. He pulled away only to witness a line of blood cover his white robes and a smile on Jin's face.

"If you explode this close, you will get hurt as well," Owen muttered in a low voice.

"It wouldn't be my first time." Jin smiled back, and a large explosion went off, knocking them both away and throwing the pair in opposite directions.

The first one that looked to recover, though, was Jin.

'After that fight with Laxmus, I realised how weak I was and saw how Arthur used the ability. He hurt himself too much, so I focused on controlling my blood hardening too to give myself some extra protection while also allowing myself to use my explosive powers in close combat.'

Still going through the air, Owen lifted his head and could see the vampire leader coming towards him. Once again, he decided to spin his body and shot himself backwards to help him get further away.

Eventually, he had reached the collapsed bridge, and the last thing that Jin saw was his body falling.

'Let's end this fight. If I block his lightning, I can get close. One more explosion should do!' Jin thought, jumping down and landing in the water.

He could see Owen standing there in the river, and now Jin was in the river as well.

"This game is quite impressive and realistic, don't you think?" Owen smiled. "Usually, I wouldn't fight like this, but you also used the environment to your advantage, and I don't exactly have my soul weapon on me either, so I thought why not."

It was at this moment that Jin could feel something amiss. Huge energy suddenly blasted across the water as Owen's whole body began to light up. Since the water was conducting his lightning-like powers, Owen had many ways to use his power - and the one he planned was the most effective.

At the same time, he coated his body, so the lightning wouldn't affect him and would redirect off him.

Dipping his hands in the water the lightning spread across the water instantly. Jin could feel his whole body being struck, and the shock was so great that he was unable to move.

Even his blood hardening couldn't stop this because it was through his entire body. Fighting through it, though, he could move his body until he saw a metal fan head his way, and following it was a lightning bolt hitting him right in the head.

When Jin regained his composure, he found himself in a white room. The match was over.

[Winner, Owen Graylash]

The board members stood up from their seats and immediately started clapping as the first match had ended. Both of them were impressive, but in the end, Owen had prevailed by taking better advantage of the terrain.

Getting out of the pod, Jin felt strange. His body and everything was fine. As a leader, he hardly touched the game, so it was an experience he hadn't felt in a long time.

"Don't look so disheartened," Sunny said with a smile. "We never know how it would have gone if you had your shield or how it would go in real life; this is just a simulation after all."

Jin knew she was trying to cheer him up, but he wasn't feeling down at all because of the outcome; instead, he was actually happy that the humans were strong.

'If the humans' power has reached this level, then maybe we can stand side by side. For many vampires, the reason for wanting to control them is because they feel like they are beings above them, but maybe this whole event will show that the difference between the two isn't that large.' Jin thought, walking off.

On the other side, Owen had left the pod with a smile on his face; he had a pleasant expression.

"What's with that smile on your face?" Grim asked.

"Not to be arrogant, but I'm probably the strongest one here, out of everyone they have gathered. Perhaps there is one better than me." Owen corrected himself. "However, if Quinn has twelve leaders that are strongly protecting him, then although I have won this one, the humans have already lost… and besides, they aren't even wearing any beast gear. It would be a frightening thought to battle them in such things." Owen thought.

The ones who had the biggest smiles on their faces, though, were the members of the Board; it was as if they had seen their own family members compete and win, even though they had done no such thing.

"We will now announce the next match!" One of the board members claimed.

The screen started to shuffle all the contestants' names, but the names of those who had already fought were omitted. Although the vampires might have had to fight multiple times, they wanted to see them all fight before that happened.

Eventually, it had stopped, and on one screen, the name of Samantha appeared from the Earthborn group, and then on the other side: The tenth family leader.

"Tenth family leader…wait a sec…that's me!" Fex thought, pointing to himself.

# Chapter 1425 - A Bigger Weapon
Reaching the room that Quinn had been in not too long ago, the smell of blood hit his nose, yet this time it was different. This time it was far stronger, and it took him just a moment to realise where it originated from.

The smell seemed to be coming from behind the stage. Quinn still had his Shadow cloak on, but the moment he started fighting the Shadow cloak would disappear revealing himself.

'Please just let me be wrong this time and this is actually only the lingering blood smell from earlier…' Quinn prayed as he headed to the back of the stage.

Before that though, he was carefully inspecting the room for any hidden cameras. He mostly focused on certain spots that were the most likely ones to have those. In the end he found nothing suspicious, but Quinn looked a little longer than he usually would have, being thorough.

'Are you just delaying checking it out, because you're afraid to find something you don't want to see?' Ray asked.

'Yeah, I'm sure of it now, I definitely prefer the silent Vincent.' Quinn answered sarcastically.

'Please don't forget that I never asked for my consciousness to be transferred over to you, o cocky descendant of mine, that decision was yours alone. That aside, you haven't answered my question.

'Just because you smell blood doesn't mean that they're dead. However, by not hurrying you might have just let them bleed out to death. Did you ever consider that?'

Hearing this, Quinn did think he was being stupid and decided to head to the stage. He was delaying going back there but there was a reason for it, he was pretty sure they were already dead. The Vampire Lord didn't just rely on his sense of smell, no, his hearing had been unable to pick up even a single heartbeat from behind those walls.

Lately he had been seeing enough death. Too many people around him were dying, but in this case, he could have saved them.

Eventually, Quinn turned the curtains though there were no cameras he could find here either. The Cursed faction leader cancelled his Shadow cloak. If there really was someone watching him, potentially alarming the Board, he would have loved to demand an explanation for the sight in front of him.

Behind the stage, all of the women that had been gathered to make a blood sacrifice for the vampires were dead. On top of that the way they had been killed indicated that it had been done by one person. Some of them had their heads lobbed off, while others had a deep cut around their throat.

'Why is the Board doing this…why…didn't I…just place them in my Shadow?' Quinn thought to himself.

At the time, the thought had crossed his mind that perhaps he could have placed them in his Shadow space, using the skill Shadow lock. That way he could have ensured their safety until they got it. The reason why he had not done so, was because he would have acted against their will.

It had been clear that all those gathered women had greatly feared him and that they had considered it a once in a lifetime opportunity to get chosen to be there. Although he had offered them protection and even payment, all of them had chosen to trust in the Board, rather than him, so he had chosen to respect their decision.

Now he realised that once again he had made the wrong choice.

'What are you going to do? And please don't tell me you plan to go to war with them for a dozen strangers you didn't even know up until today. I'm just a consciousness, so it's not like I can stop you, but I feel the need to point out that doing that would put the whole human race at risk.' Ray gave his two cents.

It was true Quinn was angry, but Ray putting it that way was right.

'No, I'm going to find out why they consider it so important that nobody finds out about this event that they don't even hesitate to silence a dozen women this way. …and at least these women can help out in some way.' Quinn thought as he went to touch their bodies with his gauntlet one by one.

The Vampire Lord was naturally using his Blood gauntlet for that, after all the other was currently with Vincent to make his ancestor look more like him. Since Quinn mostly had it equipped at all times and he would need it to register in the VR game anyway.

Still, after draining their blood, Quinn could see the numbers go up.

[15/10,000]

'I still didn't have time to gather all the blood before we left, but at least they won't be wasted this way.'

Quinn then placed all of them in his Shadow space. He would ask Logan to figure out their identities, so he could at least return their bodies to their friends and families. That was the least they could do.

After that, before exploring the place further, Quinn wanted to get in touch with another group to see how they were doing, or more accurately to learn what exactly they were doing right now. Eventually, the call connected through to Sam and the Vampire Lord had explained to him everything that had happened so far.

"I guess when they said 'nobody but those on the invitations' should know about this event, they really meant it. I wouldn't be surprised if all those butlers and servants will get killed after all of this." Sam commented. "Well, after Logan was summoned we decided to make our move as well.

"We used the device Logan left us to trace the teleporter's last location. After inputting it, we found ourselves at the military base. It looks like they left the teleporter in the middle of that strip that you described.

"There is one problem though." Sam reported. Currently his group was in one of the hangers nearby that looked to be empty. It seemed like it had been in use before, but due to the Board clearing the nearby area it was empty of personnel and just filled with crates.

"To get to where you are, we're going to need a ship, and the only ships nearby belong to the military and those in the Earthborn group. We might have to steal one if you want us to make our way over to you, and doing that without hurting any of them could be a struggle."

Quinn thought about what to do for a while, other than what he had found out, there wasn't enough suspicion to act, not just yet. Now that the bodies were gone though, a scent started to waft into Quinn's nose.

It was the smell of blood once again, but all the bodies had been cleaned up and it wasn't coming from the traces of blood on the stage or walls. Looking around, he could see there was a door left open possibly leading to the other places.

"For now, I'll continue searching for this place. Everything feels like a trap, and we need to find it before they spring it on us. If you don't hear from me in an hour, then make your way here, and Sam… do your best to not to kill anyone if you make your way over here, but prioritise not doing over that."

The call ended there, and Sam was scratching his head a bit, but he had a smile on his face. The request to not kill anyone but not die while fighting was a hard thing to do, unless one was far stronger than the other.

However, only someone like Quinn would request that, and Sam was happy that he still hadn't changed.

The reason why Quinn had made the request was because of something that Nathan had said before they had arrived at the place. That they should treat the Earthborn group and the Board as two separate groups.

He shouldn't punish those just for following orders, not when they were likely being blackmailed like the women had been, and especially not when there was a good chance that Pure might somehow be behind all of this.

Walking through the door Quinn continued to follow the scent. He used his Shadow cloak again, which would not only make him invisible, his footsteps would be silenced as they were incased in the shadow.

Looking on the ground, Quinn could see drops of blood, and it had come from the women, he was sure that following this track would lead him to the killer. Eventually he found some stairs and after climbing them to the top there was another door, leading him into a large reception room.

There was a bar, sofas, and relaxing tables all over the place. Quinn didn't know which section of the stadium he was in, but he could see someone. A person holding a scythe in his hand who was whistling as he made his way back to where had come from.

"Oh… I can feel the presence of someone who's not supposed to be here. Is someone here who is not meant to be here?" The traveller spoke, licking some blood off his scythe.

Without a doubt this was the killer. Quinn got rid of his Shadow cloak showing himself, even then the man didn't look frightened, and instead seemed more excited.

"Haha, so it's you. I wonder how you got out without the others noticing, but it doesn't matter. You know I've never tasted a V's blood before. I'm excited to experience how it differs from a human's!" The man shouted as his eyes lit up as if they were in ecstasy.

He started swinging his scythe around skilfully and held it out in front of him.

"Drinking blood…and using a scythe to cut up those women from earlier…what are you?" Quinn asked.

The man started to run forward with his scythe out, and at the same time, Quinn formed something in his hand. Using his aura and blood control he was able to create a solid curved red blade with no handle.

Then shadow started to appear from his hands.

'Seeing that scythe like that reminds me of something I haven't used in a long time.' Quinn thought, as the shadow grew until he held a much larger scythe than his opponent in his hands, only that the hilt was made of shadows, and the blade made of blood aura.

Quinn swung it out wide, and the second it touched the other's beast weapon, the attack was so strong and the blood so sharp and powerful that it cut the beast weapon in half.

"Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions." Quinn said with his eyes glowing red.

# Chapter 1426 - Qi Command
Although Sunny was fine with Jim's loss, the same couldn't be said for the other vampire leaders. They all gave Jin a glance. At first, none of them cared for this little competition, but after suffering a loss, they couldn't help but feel a bit hurt from it.

"Do you think any of you would have fared better in that match?" Jin said with a frown on his face as he had received one too many scorns. "I'm pretty sure many of you would have suffered the same fate. Let me give you all a small obvious warning. Don't underestimate your opponent."

The others couldn't really say much to Jin. The leaders did have an idea about each other's strength, but truthfully they didn't know who was stronger than the other; it wasn't like they held yearly tournaments to test everyone's strength.

However, once in a while, leaders would display their strength to others, and they could feel how strong another's blood aura was, which allowed them to have a rough estimate. In Jin's case, he was a bit different from other vampires.

Although his blood aura perhaps wasn't as strong as other leaders, he did have a strong ability that most of the other leaders would have struggled to face. They knew he was strong, and he was a little older than them as well.

Knowing that they could say no more, they decided to focus their attention on the next battle that was about to begin as the tenth leader had been called on to the stage.

Fex could feel all of the eyes staring at the back of his head as he stepped forward; he was wearing Vincent's attire with the mask covering his face, but he was still afraid that he might get caught somehow, and the other leaders weren't making it any better.

'Are they staring at me? I don't want to look back, but at the same time, I want to,' Fex thought. In the end, he had given in to his urge and twisted his head, and he was right. All of them were peering at him intensely.

"Listen," Jake said, stepping forward. "You are one of our Ro- our leaders. We have already lost once, and it will be a huge humiliation if we lose another fight. We know you might not be the best fighter among us…but don't disappoint us."

Right now, he didn't know if Jake's words were meant to inspire him or were they a threat, but it just made him more nervous.

"Please, step into the VR pod; your opponent has already entered." The butler said while gesturing at the pod with his hand.

When Fex walked up to the pod, he decided to head out and look through the glass instead of getting in. The field had changed back to the digital panels before and no longer showed the village where Owen and Jin had fought, and he could see Logan at the very end.

"What seems to be the problem?" The butler asked.

"I'm just trying to look at the stage. Please don't distract me; it's part of my tactic." Fex lied back.

'What kind of crap did I just come up with as part of my tactic… I'm just trying to get Logan's attention!' Fex thought.

He was unsure how much longer he could stare out of the window. Still, eventually, since Logan was keen on paying attention to where Quinn was, he had looked up, and when Fex saw this, he gave a quick thumbs-up before placing it back down.

"I wonder what the delay is?" The butler by Logan's side said. Seeing this and how the vampire's side hadn't started immediately, Logan had a bad feeling.

"Perhaps I should check if everything is running okay again. There might have been a problem or an incident in one of the glass containers." Logan replied as he walked out to the field. Seeing that Logan was on the move, Fex regained his composure and decided to hop into the VR pod.

Logan placed his hand on the ground, immediately perceived what had happened. It was easy for him to interpret and make it so the system would recognise him.

'It might be a little harder for you to fight. You will be using a body you are not used to, and you won't have your strong powers.' Logan thought.

The field started to change once more as the machine had selected a random map. This time, the panels began to turn into an endless grass field. The grass went on and on until the very edge of the map, till there was nothing else.

It was a simple map, where there was nowhere to hide, no barrier for them to use, and this meant the two of them could display their skills. When Fex arrived, though, he could see a saddened maiden standing opposite him.

Samantha had her head held down and wasn't even looking at him. She stared at nothing but the grass. Seeing her look this way, standing on her own in the field, Fex's heart thumped louder than it usually would in a battle.

'Ah, sh*t!' Fex thought.

———

Inside the stadium in one of the many rooms scattered throughout the gigantic building, Quinn had found himself against one of the Travellers. The guards that should be by the Board's side at all times, but this one wasn't.

And right now, Quinn currently had him pressed down with his hand, and not only that, but he also had broken both arms and legs of the Traveller. The man would have been screaming in pain, but just so they wouldn't alert anyone, Quinn had placed him inside his shadow space.

Around them were the dead bodies that Quinn had stored in there as well. He wanted to remind the Traveller of what he had done, of his crimes as he stared into the women's eyes, but it didn't look like they were getting anywhere.

At the same time, Quinn had found out that there was another problem in front of him.

'What is going on? My influence skill didn't work on him.' Quinn frowned. This was the reason why Quinn had no choice but to break the man's arms and legs to prevent him from escaping.

He was sure that his influence skill had worked on the last Traveller, but why hadn't it worked on this one. Unlike Leo, Quinn didn't have the power to see Qi directly, but he had a suspicion that this would be the case.

'Let's see what's the issue here.' Quinn thought.

He pressed his hand on his head and closed his eyes so he could picture what he was feeling more vividly. One could instantly tell the difference between a Qi user and those who were not. For the higher ranking Travellers and those naturally strong in society, they could unlock a little bit of Qi in their body without realising it.

Similar to Hilston, but he was on another level, compared to people like this. However, if someone were a frequent user, there would be traces in their body, and most of it would be stored towards the centre, to be used as wished.

Quinn knew this person was not a Qi user, so why did he have Qi covering his head?

'It's just like Leo said; these were what the board members had as well. Is this what is blocking out my influence skill? This means I can't really ask him any questions. But what if I try to remove it?'

It was the only thing Quinn could think of. Soon he inscribed his Qi into the man's body. He planned that once he touched the foreign Qi, Quinn thought he could use his knowledge of the second and third stages to remove it. In a way, Quinn thought this was also a good test for something else he wanted to try in the future.

His Qi was moving slowly, and the man started to panic.

"No…No! What are you doing! Don't touch it! Don't!"

Quinn stopped for a second.

"Are you going to tell me the truth? You are working with Pure, aren't you?" Quinn asked.

The man said nothing, but he still had a frightened look in his eyes. Quinn couldn't believe that someone who could take lives so easily as he had done could have this look in their eyes like this or deserved to have a look like this.

In the end, Quinn continued with what he was doing, but when his Qi got a few inches close to the other, something unexpected happened. It immediately moved and went straight into the Traveller's brain. Rather than coating and forming a barrier around it, it went directly into it, and the next second, the man fell on the floor, dead.

'What the…what was that…did that Qi just act on its own…and with no one around?' Quinn thought, turning his head, but there was clearly no one.

The situation was getting more dangerous by the second.

# Chapter 1427 - Look In Her Eyes
Fex Sanguinis was a young handsome vampire who was well known within the pooling area as well as the inner castle area of his family. He was also one of the most talented vampires in his generation, even when one compared him to the direct descendants.

His good looks, paired with his personality should have been the perfect recipe to make him into an outstanding leader for the thirteenth family. Alas, there was one thing that Lee Sanguines just didn't know where his son had got it from.

Although he himself used to be quite the troublemaker in his youth, for some reason Fex had become fascinated with the Human World. He talked about that other world so much that people believed that he had fallen in love with that fantasy place more so than the vampire settlement. Still, all of these things hadn't diminished his popularity, merely increased it.

Due to it, he had been able to have his fun and pick up girls in the vampire settlement without any trouble, the only thing was he had never really been interested in any of them aside from the physical aspect.

As such, he wasn't used to the feeling he held in heart whenever he saw her. A woman who was a couple years older than him, not that he minded that in any way since where he had grown up, couples could easily have age differences of decades or even a century.

'Think about it Fex, it just isn't meant to work out between a vampire and a human. By the time she'll look like a grandma, you'll have the appearance of a middle aged man at worst. When she dies, you'll still have centuries to live and when girls will still come after you, are you just meant to stay with her?' Fex talked to himself.

'Unless…I turn her.'

These were the words he was using to try to convince himself. He was trying to make his brain take over the irrational decision that his heart was making.

"You." A voice called out, and Fex looked up to see Samantha. "I may not be as strong as some of the others on our side, but I ask of you to fight properly against me and use all your strength. Please do not hold back!"

Right now, Fex was cursing the computer system for setting up such a fight. Why did it have to be her out of everyone?

'Fight properly… how am I meant to even do that? I don't exactly have my ability, and even if I did, it's not like I could have brought Agent 11 along with me.' Fex thought.

Unfortunately, he had no more time to linger on those thoughts. In an instant, Samantha had started to make her move. From behind her she had summoned what looked like nine tails, spiralling around.

Fex had seen this before, but the last time he had seen each one had a sharp pointed tip. The reason why it differed now was that the vampire had seen the woman use her soul weapon, which she was unable to use in the system. Every earth user used their powers differently but with Samantha being the daughter of one of the greatest earth users in existence, she had plenty of MC cells to use.

Fex had yet to move from his starting position and that's when he noticed a large pillar of earth rise from the ground. When doing so it wasn't straight and strong like a pillar used to build structures. Instead it had several pieces of stone attached together making it look somewhat similar to a certain game where one would catch beasts and use them to battle a rock snake like creature named On-… It allowed for a flexible movement, and the next thing the vampire could see was it striking down like a gigantic tentacle towards him.

Seeing it move though, Fex felt like it was incredibly slow and moved out of the way, making its attack hit nothing but the ground. However, to him it felt as if he had only moved ever so slightly.

'What the…' Fex wondered, looking at his arms. 'I could have sworn I just moved faster?!'

That's when it hit him. Right now, the vampire wasn't controlling a version of HIS body! He was controlling a version of Vincent in the game, which technically was Quinn's body. His avatar was just as fast, and as strong as his blood brother!

While Fex had still been in the middle of sorting his thoughts, Samantha hadn't just waited around. When her first attack had failed the woman had continued to push, allowing the tail to sweep across the ground hitting the distracted vampire.

Still, the hit didn't hurt as much as he had expected it to, and Fex still felt like he was in control. Sticking his feet onto the ground, Fex turned his body around and placed both hands on the giant snake rock, and it had come to a sudden stop.

'This strength! This is the body of a Vampire Lord…no this is Quinn's body.' Fex corrected himself. Pleased with what he had done, turning around he could soon see several pillars of a similar size that had been raised in front of him, yet he showed no fear.

It didn't take long for Fex to get used to the speed and strength, he himself was already fast in his own body. He could keep up with everything, and it was only taking him a little while to get used to the increase from his normal body.

Avoiding the giant snake pillars was a good warm up for him, and eventually when he felt like he was finally strong enough to deal with it, he readied his fist preparing to smash through one of the pillars heading towards him.

'This is how Quinn did it, right?!' Fex thought imitating his steps. He steadied his foot on the ground, and charged with a surge in his body the blood aura, then at the right time he threw out his fist right towards the heads of one of the giant snake pillars. On impact the stone exploded, and a hole could be seen through reaching about half way of the entire pillar.

'Only half…and for some reason the attack seemed weaker than his.' Fex wondered what the reason for what could be. The attack the vampire had just tried to imitate had been the hammer strike. Being around Quinn for a while he had seen it many times before, and was sure he had perfectly copied it.

However, what others didn't realise from only watching him was that there was so much more behind the Vampire Lord's attacks. His attacks used a perfect mix between Qi and blood to create devastating blows.

'I guess there's no need to make this last any longer than I need to.' Fex decided, running forward. Now that he was close to Samantha, she could use her tails, and these were faster than the pillars that she would use.

Nevertheless, it didn't matter, for Fex was still able to avoid them all, and the last one he leapt towards her, Samantha thought that this was her chance as her opponent shouldn't be able to change direction while midair, but wrapping his arm around in Blood hardening, Fex pushed through the last tail smashing it again, and eventually landing right on top of Samantha, knocking her onto the floor.

His arms pinned her down, onto the grass and he had reached her. The two of them looked into each other's eyes for a second. For Samantha she could only see the eyes of her opponent behind the mask, and nothing else. Looking deeply Fex didn't know what had come over him, as he eventually blurted out…

"I think I'm in love with you."

There was silence, and only struggle on Samantha as she tried to get up but the strength was overwhelming. It took her a few seconds to process everything, until she eventually spoke no longer struggling.

"I…give up." Samantha said, unsure how to react to this sudden confession. She was aware that she could no longer fight and her opponent was too strong for her. The next second, Fex' and Samantha's bodies started to disappear.

When Fex got out of the pod, the other leaders were speechless as they looked at him.

"Was… that some type of tactic?" Vincent asked, half curious, half teasing. "Confessing to her so she would give up?"

The vampire was too embarrassed to reply, happy that the mask he currently had on at least hid his red face. He had gotten caught up in that moment, making him completely forget that they had been in the game and that anything they would say would be forwarded to all of the onlookers.

Fex would have given anything for Quinn to summon him away at this moment, but he knew that wouldn't happen. He had a role to fulfil and since he couldn't exactly leave the room, he went towards a corner and just kept staring at a wall, thankful to at least have a mask on him.

"Who cares? The important thing is he won and he did it with ease! Jin's loss must have been a fluke!" Nicu said with his arms folded.

In the other room, Samantha wasn't in the best of moods either, so much so that no one wanted to speak with her at all. The Board was also very disappointed. Not only had the tenth leader won, but he had done so without revealing an ability.

From what they knew so far all vampires had an ability, but this one had just used his Blood powers, speed and strength to overwhelm her. They couldn't even blame it on being a bad match up.

The screen's started to filter once again, as the next opponents were seemingly randomly selected and it was at that point that it had landed on the first leader Nicu.

"Finally! I'll show you all how it's done." Nicu proudly proclaimed, already walking forward without a care in the world who he would face. Then on the other screen, it had stopped on a blonde haired boy named Sil.

"I would like to ask you all for a favour." Sil spoke to those in the room around him. "If you don't mind, I would like to touch each one of you to borrow your abilities. I would like to destroy my opponent in this fight!"

*****

# Chapter 1428 - A Special Power
Upon seeing Sil's face come on screen, the vampires wondered who he was. There was a couple that recognized him as someone who had tried to help stop Fex's execution; at the time, he had used two blades and only had the strength to put up with a vampire knight but couldn't even defeat one.

So they were wondering just how come this person was invited as one of the strongest humans. What they didn't know was at the time, the one they had seen fight was actually Vorden, nor did they know about his powers since he was unable to copy vampire MC cells.

Inside the other glass container, Sil had just requested for the others to help him out.

Of course, unlike the vampires, everyone in the room knew of Sil's power since they had seen him and his family defeat the five spiked Dalki, known as Slicer.

Surprisingly, the first one out of everyone to approach Sil was Mona. She walked forward, leaving her large friend by her side and held onto Sil's hands.

"It doesn't matter that you can't really use my ability, right?" Mona winked. "Let's surprise those vampires with a big bang. I don't exactly like the way some of them were looking at us."

Having an idea of how Sil's ability worked, she thought she could put her MC cells to use.

Of course, the next one in line was Owen.

"Although I no longer follow the Blade family, you are following someone else I quite enjoy seeing, and I would like to see just how far you can go." He chuckled while also allowing Sil to touch his hands.

Looking around the room, there wasn't really anyone else with whom Sil was familiar. There were the other Graylash members, but Sil could only take the strongest of the MC cells from them. Still, even with just those two abilities, Sil had the power of the previous Big Four in him.

There was Sach, but Sil couldn't take powers from other vampires. In the end, he thought he might have to go in there with just these two powers.

"Sil, wait," Sach thought of something. "You don't need to touch the others."

Sil was confused by his words.

"Remember, this is just a game. All you need to do is take the powers you want and contact Logan. That should be okay. It doesn't matter if you know what the abilities are."

"Of course," Sil nodded because he only had in mind to use one person's ability. Logan knew this would be the case when Sil was to enter the game, and based on the information he could gather; he had applied six of the strongest abilities gathered by the humans to Sil.

However, on top of this, since Sil's power was more complex, he had to do several things. He had to code in so many variables if Sil wanted to put these powers together towards one ability or just to switch between them quickly.

On the other side, Nicu had a large smile on his face and turned around to the others.

"We need to show them that we are no pushovers. I know I am a young leader, but I carry the weight of the vampire settlement and the first family, and I don't want to disappoint any of them."

Just before Nicu got in, one more person wanted to say something to him.

"Nicu…you won't win this fight," Vincent said. "When you lose it, I don't want you to feel disheartened.

"As you said, you are the first family leader and a strong one at that. Especially for your age, but…this person is the world's strongest human at the moment, there is no way for you to win."

The other vampires were quite stunned by Vincent's words. For one, they thought there was no need for him to say this, but for him to say such things without a doubt of hesitation, they wondered if he simply just underestimated Nicu or overestimated the other person, but that wasn't the case at all.

Maybe if it was Sil, when he was at the Cursed faction, but the Sil now was in a room with the strongest humans in the world. There wouldn't be a point in time other than now where he would be stronger.

The Sil of the Cursed faction had a limited pool of people to select from, and of course, there weren't many that weren't vampires with super strong abilities, but this case was different.

Nicu ignored Vincent's words. After all, he felt that the latter was treating him differently because he was young.

The two got into their capsules, and the terrain started to change once again. They were in a rocky place that had giant rocks as large as houses spread across the whole land; it wasn't straight either and bumpy—a difficult place to fight for the both of them.

The two appeared on either end of the map, and the match was getting ready to start.

'They have given me a different weapon that is similar to my blood weapon, so at least I have a sword.' Nicu thought. He looked in front of him but could not see his opponent; the mountains blocking their view were all he could see.

While the others watching above could see them quite clearly.

"It looks like this map is quite the fun one." Sunny commented. "They will have to use the map to their advantage for attacking and defending. Also, they need to be aware of each other's positions other than relying on their vision. I believe Nicu has the advantage in this one due to his nose."

"I agree," Jin added. "Although, Vin- HE said those words, Nicu has grown going through the forced rituals. It was tough on him, and there was a low chance of it succeeding, but he had decided to go through them anyway.

"I can't imagine what he has planned through, but he has the potential to reach the level of a vampire lord just like us. He is no less than us."

Vincent could hear the others talking, disagreeing with his opinion, but he knew they would soon come around; they all would.

When Sil appeared, he could see the strange rocks blocking his view at that moment.

"I can't see him," Sil said. "But that doesn't matter; I'll just destroy the whole field."

The others could hear what he was saying but could not comprehend his words. A second later, though, Sil started to summon lightning from his hands, and they could see it was the same power that Owen had used against Jin.

"Is this why you said Nicu would face trouble?" Jin asked. "It's a good thing that they are fighting on a different map than the one I fought on. Otherwise, Nicu could suffer from direct attacks that could be quite troublesome."

The lighting, though, started to grow from Sil's hands, and something strange happened; the sparks that would constantly show started to condense. It is almost a solid form of blue light. Sil was holding onto what looked like gigantic whips of lighting that stretched from the two sides of the maps with his bare hands.

He then lifted them and swung them across to each other. Both of them lashed out, and the second it touched the large rocks, they fired off strong sparks, crumbling and getting destroyed instantly.

The lightning whips destroyed everything they touched and extended to the point where they covered the entire map.

In the end, Nicu was unable to see anything. He hadn't even seen his opponent and only felt rumbling before he could see two lashes of bright blue go towards him, and the next second, he was in the white room.

The pod opened, and Nicu came out from the game.

"What happened? Was there something wrong with the game?" Nicu asked. "The map just loaded, then there was this white light, and now I'm back here."

The others didn't know what to say, nor did they know how to explain to him that he had simply lost the match.

While Nicu was dumbfounded, Sil exited from his pod on the other side, and everyone on his side was at a loss for words, including himself.

'That power I just wielded… I don't know if it was the game or not…but there was more strength in it than when I had the power of all the Big Four…one of the guys in this room is incredibly strong.' Sil thought.

# Chapter 1429 - All Fake
After Nicu had learned of what really happened during the fight, he couldn't believe it. He thought all of the vampires were playing a joke on him and his actions clearly stated it.

"Yeah, come on, just let me know when the machine is ready, and I'll teach that person a lesson." Nicu laughed once more.

At this point, it was getting embarrassing for the other leaders. They felt sorry for him.

However, after telling him several times that it wasn't the case, none of the leaders really knew what to say anymore. Since the butler felt like this was going nowhere, he decided to intervene.

"We have a special video feed that will allow you to watch back what was on the match." The butler said without asking if Nicu wanted to watch it or not.

A display appeared in front of them all.

It showed exactly what the others could see. As if a camera was attached to their position and showed everything to Nicu. From when had arrived in the game, up till Sil had produced that single attack that ended it all.

Once the video had ended, the others were looking at Nicu, while trying not to make it too obvious they really were looking at him simultaneously.

"It…can't be real right…How can a human have that much power? They must have boosted his powers in the game!" Nicu refused to believe it until eventually, Vincent stood in front of him and placed both hands firmly on his shoulders.

"Listen to me, do you remember what I said." Vincent looked him in the eyes. "If any of us went out there, not a single one would have survived. I wasn't joking when I said that. You drew the short straw in this one.

"When we were asked to help the humans, it wasn't because they were weak. It's just that the Dalki were too strong. I hope you realise why joining forces is the best for both of our races."

Although Vincent hated to admit it, this whole event was making the leaders realise how serious of a threat the Dalki were and put the humans up on the ladder. Even if it wasn't intentional.

'It would have been nice if you could see this, Quinn. Sometimes you can drop words of wisdom on them that even I can't. I hope things are all okay on your end, young one.' Vincent thought.

——

At the moment, Quinn had left his shadow space. He had looked over the Traveller's body several times to see if he could find anything, but the traces of Qi seemed to disappear once the host had died.

It was the strangest thing that Quinn had ever seen before.

'Is it even possible to control Qi when it's not in sight?' Quinn started to think. He knew about the third stage of Qi, which was using one's own outside of your body, but this seemed more like a command. He was also pretty sure that the Traveller himself knew about it as well.

'The fear on his face, he knew that if I tried to do something, the Qi would kill him. Maybe rather than control, it's more like something as a command. A set of rules, maybe? If that's the case, it would also explain why he couldn't say anything.

'It's hard to guess whether or not the Qi was originally there just for this reason or to block out the vampire's influence skill. How would they know it would block out the influence skill in the first place?'

Regardless of all this, what Quinn did realise was that all members of the Board had the same thing, Which potentially meant all of their lives were at risk and were in the same situation. It wasn't the Board at fault, but Pure.

'I have to find out the reason for this whole event!'

The stadium was gigantic, and even with Quinn's super speed, it would be hard for him to find something quickly. What would have been ideal was to use something like Leo's ability to search the place or have some sort of guide.

Otherwise, he would have to check every single room. The one advantage that Quinn had was the fact that there was no room that he couldn't get into, thanks to his skill of shadow travel, which allowed him to pass through the ground and through walls. He was sure that the important information would be behind locked doors.

With this in mind, Quinn continued to search the place and was ready to call the others over when need be. He had made the mistake of trying to save everyone himself before, Quinn wouldn't be shy to call on for their help if need be, and he preferred them to be closer anyway.

Unless there was a threat at the same level as Laxmus, it would be okay, which was why he was holding off for now, because his gut was telling him there was something seriously wrong.

——

At the moment, Sam and the others were on standby. They were mostly relaxing in the nearby hangar, out of sight from all the others, waiting for Quinn's orders.

At the same time, he was busy watching the military's movement. There was no need for binoculars since he could see far out due to his vampire self.

"You think of joining them or something. You're looking at them so hard I think they can feel your eyeballs." Nate joked.

"No, it's not that it's just a little strange…I was looking at them, and it was something Logan said before he left." Sam replied.

"He said something?"

"Yeah, he was trying to locate our location. That way, he could pinpoint where for us to go next. He didn't say anything directly to me, but it was a comment he made. 'I don't remember seeing this place?'"

Nate gave a look to Sam like he was possibly overthinking things, but he couldn't blame him. They were hiding in secret right in the enemy's territory.

"Maybe he's just never been here before, or he meant he doesn't recognise it on the map. That guy is so clever that we can never understand him." Nate shrugged his shoulders.

"That's why I'm concerned. Logan is so clever that he almost never makes a mistake, but that doesn't mean he doesn't overlook things. His mind works almost like a computer itself, so if he doesn't remember this place, then it means he had never seen it before anywhere.

"Not in all the files he researched when hacking into the Earthborn group, not with all of the Green family's information or the information he recently obtained from Richard. So if this place wasn't marked on any of those, what type of military base is this?"

"Or maybe it's not a military base at all." Another came in, who happened to be listening to the whole conversation. When turning around, the others could see that it was Layla.

"I know why you've been watching them for a long time now, something is off, and I felt the same as well, and then it finally hit me, after hearing what you two were talking about. I'm not sure if they're all soldiers or if any of them are, there's been one for two faces I recognise, and if that's the case…then it means they're from Pure."

The others' eyes widened listening to this information. It was exactly what Sam was looking at. The soldiers', something was off to the point where it looked like they were just pretending to be military, and that facade was slowly going away the more he watched them.

"If they are Pure, then how are they so openly on land like this and have a base setup here!?" Nate said, a little panicked.

"Do we know how long this whole event has been planned for? Maybe this whole place was built in a week with abilities." Layla replied. "Pure don't usually have a base like this, so something is seriously up."

"Well then, it looks like we're just going to have to catch one of them and get some answers ourselves." Sam smiled.

Still, there was something even more worrying in Sam's mind. If What Layla was saying was true, then there was one person who should have noticed and alarmed the others, so why didn't they?

# Chapter 1430 - A Blast From The Past
With the Nicu situation over, it was time for them to proceed to the next fight, and now the vampire leaders looked to be more focused than before. They were no longer chilled or laid back about the event as their pride made it so they couldn't afford to lose anymore.

While on the other side, morale was quite high. Vampires were seen as these unknown beings with strange powers. The few times people had made reports on them or the times when they appeared on camera, they looked beyond strong.

Super strength, super speed, enhanced senses, a lust for blood, blood powers, the ability to take over minds, and lastly, they could turn others. All of these things made them freighting beings, and it didn't help that the last time there was an introduction of a new species, they had gone to war with them.

However, since the humans were able to defeat some of the leaders, the strongest vampires, it gave them confidence and pride for the competition.

The next set of people to appear on the screen was one of the head generals, and they were to go up against one of the Vampire leaders. They went in with great confidence thinking it would be easy. Yet, this was not the result at all.

The vampire leaders weren't even giving them a chance, using their abilities as quickly as possible and using more variations in their blood powers. No matter what map they were on, they had an advantage due to their smell and speed, and they had overwhelmed the generals.

This hadn't just happened once, but in the next set of fights, the leaders won again and again. Even the new leaders had found success, the twelfth family, the second family, and many others.

Watching the sight, as the humans suffered loss after loss, was more than just demotivating; they were being broken down. When they saw Hermes from the Graylash family being selected, they thought he would perhaps have a chance.

Twice those with lighting powers had won, so they thought it would be the same again, but Hermes suffered a defeat from the fifth leader Sunny, who didn't even use any ability while fighting.

There was no more hope for them, they felt like only Owen and Sil could win, but that was the strength of two people, not those of the human race.

Inside the Boardroom, the members were furious about the results so far.

"It's a good thing we didn't broadcast this event; otherwise, we would have been humiliated, and it would have only struck fear into us all." One of them said.

"Calm down; there are still fights left to go, do not think it is the end; remember, they still haven't made their move yet either." The old man said.

As for the fights from the humans who hadn't fought, there were Leo, Sach, Chris, Agent 3, Grim Graylash, two of the Unranked who stayed close to each other, unlike the rest of the unranked, and finally Mona Bree.

Most of the vampires had already fought, which meant soon the cycle would repeat because even though they had fought before, they would need to again. As for the next fight that was to take place, the screen eventually stopped at none other than the Supreme Commander Sach.

Stepping forward, he felt confident, but as for all the generals in the Earthborn group who had been defeated, they felt like it would be the same for him. Perhaps things would have been different if he had a piece of demon tier equipment like Oscar or was as strong as Oscar, but they all knew that Sach was a few steps behind if the two of them were to be compared.

Sach looked across the room before getting into the pod, waiting for his opponent to be selected.

'Quinn, I want to show you that I haven't just been sitting around doing nothing after you gave me a second chance, when you visited me in that hospital. Not only that, but my body was stronger, and the ability allowed me to improve my body even more.

'I… won't let One Horn get his way the next time I meet him the next time. So whoever I have to face right now, he will be my stepping stone.'

Eventually, the screen stopped and landed on the sixth leader. He was one of the new leaders but not as fresh as the others and was succeeding Vadeen Muscat, who Arthur killed. Sach's opponent would be Jake Muscat.

"So, the Cursed faction has Sil, the Graylash family have Owen, but who do the Earthborn group have? Sach, are you going to be that person?" Mona commented.

In a way, the other groups also needed to show their strength to each other, and currently, the Earthborn group was looking the weakest by far, and she knew Sach very well understood this. With all the weight on his shoulders, she expected him to perform something quite special to them all.

———

Quinn's search and continued around the stadium. He could not find any other personnel around, nor could he smell blood. Right now, he had entered the north section of the stadium; this was close to where the Board was viewing the fight from the glass pods.

He thought if anywhere, he was most likely to find something here, and he was partially right as he finally found himself coming across a locked door. The first one he had seen in the place. Using shadow travel, he quickly bypassed the doors.

Using his inspect skill, he probably could have also received the access code, but thought that might cause some type of alarm to go off or maybe even leave behind some unwanted traces of himself. When arriving on the other side, Quinn instantly felt a chill.

The room was far colder than it was anywhere else in the place. In front of him was a long hallway. One could go in several directions, and he didn't know where to start or the rooms to enter.

'Is it a lab? Why is there always a lab in these types of places?' Quinn thought.

'That reminds me, what happened to those servants that were with those girls?' Ray commented. 'We saw the dead bodies of the girls but never saw those servants no matter where we have gone, and what exactly was that Traveller doing?'

This was something Quinn couldn't answer, but the Traveller had come from this direction, so perhaps he was heading here. When walking past, some large thick glass panels allowed one to look through and see what was inside, and it was a sight that Quinn remembered seeing a long time ago.

'This place, it's like the lab that was underneath the school that time.' Quinn thought. 'Paul said that the military was doing all sorts of experiments, and they would send people to these places.'

'It does look like that, but I don't see any experimental subjects.' Ray commented.

He was right about that, all of the experimental rooms looked empty, and there was no smell of blood. Still, Quinn thought he would be able to find something at least.

'Maybe if Logan was here, he could get some information from these computers to see what experiments they were running. This doesn't seem to be Pure's doing since the stadium was here for a long time.'

Eventually, Quinn had come across another door. This one was ten metres in height and was almost dark black. Just looking at it, he could tell it was made of pure thick Galthrium. How thick it was, he couldn't even imagine.

To the point that even if he did use all his strength to punch the door down, he wasn't so sure he could bring it down. At least not in one hit.

Still, using his shadow travel, he easily bypassed this as well, and when he popped back up, Quinn found himself in a large arena looking room. It was almost another mini arena that was built into the stadium, and here, the smell of blood was strong.

Above, there were also several rooms, almost like observant rooms made from glass that would allow one to see what was going on.

'…Sh*t…' Quinn said, looking at the whole area around him. It was filled with countless bodies lying all over the floor; some were even piled on top of each other, like garbage in a rubbish dump. But there was something strange about them. They weren't exactly cut or bleeding; instead, it looked almost as if someone had starved all of them.

Going up to one of the bodies, Quinn turned it over.

Its skin was so sunken and dried; it was as if someone had just sucked everything out of their body, leaving only skin and bones.

'This…' Ray said in a low voice, 'I've seen this before…this is Qi Draining.'

*****

# Chapter 1431 - The Strong Vampire
Lately, it seemed like Quinn was learning more and more about this mysterious power known as Qi. A power that humans themselves had developed for years. It was so mystically strange and powerful that it made Quinn wonder at times what would have been the situation on Earth if everyone had learned it.

Perhaps they would have even been able to defend themselves better. Still, it didn't seem like his mysterious ancestor, who existed during the era of Dragons, knew about the mysterious power, and it was a first for him.

'Qi drain… you know about Qi?' Quinn asked.

'Yes, mana energy obtained from the outside and the world itself, while Qi was internal energy within oneself. The way these people look, I've seen it before. Without a doubt, this is the effect of Qi drain.' Ray started to explain.

'It was a skill that I used a lot against my enemies. The skill is kind of similar to your gauntlet, only far more advanced, and there is no need to have any equipment to use it either.

'The skill allows you to steal Qi from another person and add it to your own. You are not borrowing it, rather forcefully taking it away from the other person, to the point where they can no longer gather Qi in their body. At the same time, it increases yours. Now you know Qi's other name, don't you?'

Thinking about this, Quinn was reminded of the time when Lucy, Layla's mother, had died. She called Qi life energy and gave it to her daughter.

'When there's no more Qi to take, then it starts to take their life energy as well.' Quinn said.

Quinn sighed upon hearing these words, 'But how come from so many people? Is the amount of Qi they can take unlimited?'

'No.' Ray replied. 'In my case, I was special, but even then, there were times when my body couldn't handle the amount of Qi.' Ray replied.

It reminded me of Quinn when he had absorbed blood. It was the same for him, with each evolution, his body could handle a bit more from last time.

'From what I see, we can assume that these dead people in this room perhaps didn't learn Qi in the first place; in other words, the Qi inside them was extremely scarce. Which was why, perhaps, the enemy had to also resort to taking their life energy as well.'

If he had just heard about a skill, perhaps Quinn wouldn't have believed it, but recalling about the time when Lucy did something similar, and now seeing this scene in front of him, it made him think that there had to be others that had this knowledge of how to transfer Qi and take Qi.

The signs were still pointing to Pure, and perhaps they had taken all those from this Lab to drain them. The bodies, it was hard to tell how long they had been in such a state, but the skin didn't look too deteriorated.

Quinn could do nothing since there was no information on these people; he couldn't give them the same treatment as he had done the girls. In the first place, he was worried about messing with this place.

In the future, he might have to come again with Logan just to find out what the Board members were doing before Pure came and interrupted things. The other worrying thing was that all this information was in Pure's hands as well.

'How involved are Pure with the Board members… Do they now control all of their families, including all the assets from behind the scenes while everyone is fighting, sacrificing their lives against the Dalki?

'Pure has been taking over Earth bit by bit and getting stronger…what is this crap!' Quinn was beyond annoyed if this was the case.

Although not a direct enemy, Pure was starting to get under his skin, even more so than the meddling Vampires of the past.

Searching the area some more, Quinn was unable to find anything else. Nothing that he could figure out or seemed to be of importance. And since he hadn't found out what Pure was planning with this event, the search was to go on.

Having left his shadow travel, Quinn eventually exited from the large black doors and left the facility as well. Once outside, though, and having taken a few steps, Quinn could immediately smell someone.

'Are you not going to hide?' Ray asked.

'No, I'm going to ask them what the hell are they doing here in the first place?' Quinn thought.

Eventually, walking back towards the stadium, the two figures found each other.

"Quinn?" A voice called out.

"Nathan?" Quinn frowned.

——

A snowfield. Recently it seemed like wherever Sach was going to snow was following him. After leaving a planet of snow, he was now fighting on a snowfield. Similar to the first map, it had a design of a village.

However, a single wall was built around them, and down the middle was a deep ditch. There was no bridge or anything like that, but it didn't matter.

Also, in this fight, the opponent had lost the advantage over the sense of smell that the vampires had when using the terrain, because Sach was exactly the same.

The fight had started, and immediately, Sach ran forward and went over the wall that was rebuilt by the map. He leapt towards the ditch and quickly landed; it was an impressive speed. However, there was a difference between Sach and the other vampires.

He was wearing beast gear, which gave him more stats than the average vampire. Eventually, Jake also leapt down and was deep in the snow ditch as well. When landing though, he had done so with his knees bent, and his hands were touching the floor.

"Another easy win for us, it seems." Katori, the second leader, commented. "With the snow, it's impossible even to see where those traps were set up in the first place. The second that guy steps in them, he's done for."

Standing up, Jake taunted his opponent as he punched his fist and gestured to him to come forward. Sach wasn't going to back down from a challenge. One Horn would have charged onwards, so he was going to do the same.

The one thing Sach didn't want to reveal in this fight was the fact that he could use his blood powers, so he would have to leave everything to his physical strength, but that was alright. However, while running forward, Jake smiled when he noticed that Sach had stepped exactly into the trap he had placed.

Sach's whole body had frozen at that instant, and seeing this, Jake wasted no time, creating a blood fist and throwing it as hard as he could towards Sach's side.

Seeing the incoming attack, Sach could only brace himself. It was a large blow; so devastating that the impact could even be seen through the other side of Sach. Even the snow on the side could be seen being pressed, but Sach stayed there strong.

"Looks like I can move now." Sach smiled. "That's a strong hit, but if I couldn't take a punch from you. I definitely wouldn't be able to take a punch from him!" Sach shouted as he swung his leg out, delivering a devastating thigh kick to Jake.

It was far faster than he had expected. Jake was surprised someone could move so fast after a blow.

'Aren't his ribs broken?' Jake thought.

The next second, the kick landed, and a large cracking sound echoed. Jake collapsed in an instant in the snow as the kick's power broke his leg.

"No," Sach shook his head. "You need to be better than this for me to improve!"

Spinning on the floor and getting up on his one good leg, Jake thought he could recover somehow, but before he could, another devastating kick landed, right on his head, and the match concluded right then and there.

It was another quick defeat, but for once, it was on the human's side rather than the Vampires side.

The leaders were left with a strange taste in their mouth; they all knew that the other party was a vampire, but to meet one who had no ranking in their world and was stronger than a vampire leader, they just didn't know how that was possible.

Seeing this, Vincent thought it was the perfect time to educate them all.

"He was Quinn's teacher, after all. Those kicks were powerful, and with his ability, they became even stronger, but the main reason why there was such a huge gap between the two of you is because of what was on his legs."

Unaware, Vincent had just said Quinn instead of him, but it was hard to keep pretending to be someone else.

The others thought back to remember what was on Sach's legs, and they remembered they were covered in a thick silver and blue-like armour. His whole legs had even lit up slightly as he threw out his kicks.

"The beast armour," Sunny said.

"Exactly, this is the power of tools." Vincent smugly smiled. He remembered the time of his past reign when he was the only one who created beast weapons.

The others used to laugh at him, but none of them were laughing now after seeing one of their own being defeated by the tools.

The event was to go one regardless, and as stated multiple times, this wasn't a competition to see who had won more fights than the other. It was learning about each other and teaching the vampires a lot.

The game generator went off again, revealing the next match participants, and there were only three from the vampire's side that had yet to fight. Vincent, or Quinn, Lee, and Muka. In the end, the leader's name had appeared, and Muka was called to the stage.

And her opponent was another one who wasn't exactly a human, the blind swordsman.

*****

# Chapter 1432 - Parental Instinct
Although the A.I had selected the next fight, there was a small break from the non-stop matches. It was time for the others to talk about what had happened so far, and the idea was they could discuss how to improve and where they needed improvement from the others.

At least, this is what the Board said the break was for, and that's what currently one side was doing at least. The vampire leaders didn't really want to speak about the losses they had suffered, and they were already aware of the mistakes they had made.

The good thing was that the Butler was able to show a repeat telecast to them of the multiple fights that had happened so far, so they could watch over and see what went wrong. As for Nicu, in this case, he just stood there, and there wasn't much he could learn from watching his fight, not that he wanted to see it again.

On the other side, the humans had gathered in types of groups to evaluate their matches, getting advice from each other. Some of them lost not just because they were weaker but they lacked tactics and fighting sense.

Although the vampires hadn't fought a lot, they seemed to have battle knowledge of fighting and using the terrain around them. Perhaps it was due to how long they lived or because they were a race that relied only on strength. Even if they only fought against each other, that was still experience.

In the meantime, there was one who had yet to watch her own match and was grabbing some water from a machine that was off to the side.

She placed a bottle, filling it up, and when taking it off from the machine, her fingers fumbled a little causing her to drop the bottle onto the floor. The water spilt all over the ground.

"It's just not my day…is it?" Samantha mumbled as she went to pick up her water bottle, but before she could, there was another hand that had picked it up before her.

"Thank you," Samantha said.

She was quite surprised to see a large man in front of her. At least she thought it was a man based on the thick armour, but it was impossible to see his face since he covered it with a bucket-like helmet of some kind, where one could only see small slits where the eyes were.

She also found it strange that he carried this box by his side, and not once had he let it go or put it down.

Taking the bottle from the man, she was expecting him to leave after saying thank you, but the figure just stood there not saying a single word, it felt a little awkward, and she didn't know what else to say.

'Now that I look at him a bit more, he's about the same size as him…' She thought.

"What are you doing? You're going to scare the girl," Mona said as she walked over to her new companion. "Sorry about that, he can't really speak, but he's kind and helpful, I promise."

Standing in front of Oscar, Mona was a little worried about his actions. She thought something might happen when he saw her daughter of all things, but… this wasn't the real Oscar, or at least not the same Oscar that they remembered, yet seeing her must have triggered something.

'A loving family bond that just can't be forgotten, huh…I guess you must have really loved her, and even now you want to help and protect her…but if she were to see who you were or what you have become; if they were all to see you, I wonder what they would think?' Mona thought.

It looked like her new friend wouldn't leave this girl alone, and she had to do something.

"Hey, why don't you come over? We can watch your fight together; it might give me an idea how these leaders fight." Mona asked. "You know us girls have to stick together, and you put up a good fight. From what I saw, the leader you faced was a bit faster compared to all the others, and stronger, you were just a bit unlucky."

Looking around, so far, Samantha had been staying close to Sach, but she did feel a little awkward, and for some reason, the large figure, although it might have startled others, it didn't really startle her.

Chairs and tables were arranged by more servants who seemed to have come out of nowhere. They must have been in the stadium somewhere or just outside the glass container. Once everyone had taken their seats, the video started to play of Samantha's match.

As soon as it started, her face turned red by the second, as she remembered certain details.

"Oh!" Mona smiled. "Is that why you didn't see the replay of your match? I have to admit I didn't expect a vampire to confess to you in the middle of a match like that. I mean, there are some good-looking guys in that group, and they're all practically flawless, the same for the girls.

"I can't imagine why they would pick anyone from us; not that you aren't beautiful, of course." Mona quickly said, trying not to offend anyone, but she was just speaking the truth. Nearly every single one of the vampires could become a star actor or a model.

"I couldn't really see his face." Samantha blurted out. "He had a mask…but he seemed familiar; I don't know why?"

She really didn't know why, but there was one person she had met a while ago that reminded her of this person; he seemed a bit immature for his age and imagined it was something he would have done. Confessing out of nowhere with no regard for the others feelings.

The scene continued to play out, with Mona giving some tips. She claimed that Samantha was relying too much on her earth powers. Her use of the earth ability was creative, and she had spent a long time learning how to make it, so the earth ability wasn't so rigid, and that was good.

However, it would do her well if she also thought of using the powers in a close manner. There could be multiple forms of attack against her opponent at once; it was good advice, but also something hard to pull off and hazardous.

Another alternative was to try and focus on some type of defence if she was going to attack like so. Even the tails that she usually would use might have been called defensive, but it was an offensive defence.

The earth ability was one of the best abilities when it came to defence if used in the right way.

Eventually, though, the scene had come, where Fex had landed right on top of Samantha. The video had audio, and all of them heard it well.

"I think I'm in love with you."

The video played, and straight after, there was a loud bang on the table. Both Mona and Samantha had felt the vibration on the same table they were sitting at, because it had come from a large friend next to them.

'Did…he just get angry because of the confession?' Mona thought. 'I mean, actually anger? I guess that's the parental instinct to protect his daughter.'

"Is he okay?" Samantha asked.

"Yeah… he's okay," Mona replied.

Soon, the break was over, and passing the new information they comprehended on to those who had yet to fight, they thought they might have a better chance at facing the vampires now and in the future.

However, something unexpected happened. The Board member's room had received a call, and the call was coming from one of the butlers in the vampire leaders' room. Answering it was the middle-aged man with a grey beard, who went by the name Andy.

"Sir, I don't know how to say this, but the leader that had been elected to fight… we have a bit of a problem." The Butler said.

Standing outside looking at the board members, Muka just stood there with a smile, waving at them.

"Very well," Andy replied. "Accept their request."

# Chapter 1433 - A Bad Call
During the break on the vampire leader's side, most of them weren't really doing anything in their glass container. This made Vincent realise a significant problem with the leaders; although they acted as a council, the leaders weren't quite united.

All of the families were only close with those loyal to their families, there were a few that regularly talked with each other, such as Jin and Sunny, but as for the rest, they weren't on the best terms.

'Is there a way to fix the current situation, or perhaps making the leaders do things together regularly like this is the solution?' Vincent thought, looking at them as there were small breakthroughs here and there.

'If only the vampire leaders did more as they grew up.'

At the same time, Vincent was curious about another thing. Their fight had just been announced, but there was one person who was at a table on their own, and a constant sound was ringing out. It was safe to say that their actions were strange.

When going over, Vincent noticed that Muka was busy tossing a coin; she looked and saw that the coin had landed on the tail's side. Immediately, Muka picked it up and tossed the coin once again.

"If I were to ask you what are the chances of a coin landing on heads or tails, what would your answer be?" Muka asked, clearly hearing and noting that Vincent had appeared and was looking over her shoulder.

"Are we talking about out of a number of times, or each time the coin is spun? If it's the latter, then there are only two choices, so it's fifty-fifty?" Vincent answered; he thought if there was some trick to the question but decided to respond with what he thought was right.

"Ah… I see. In your scenario, if there are two equal options, then you are probably right? But aren't there things that can influence a coin spin? Such as the strength used to spin the coin, the weight of one side compared to the other. In the first place, the head of the coin weighs more than the tails, which means it is more likely to fall on that one side.

"However, there is one more influence, luck. As you know, I have plenty of it. So then why…" The coin eventually stopped spinning once more and landed on tails again. "So why, with my luck, with the head side of the coin being heavier and my spinning, is it always landing on tails…it seems that this is not my match to participate in."

Honestly, for someone like Vincent, he always found the ninth leader's ability the strangest. The ability's strength varied from vampire to vampire, and it seemed like an impossible thing to test.

Yet, Vincent had to believe it because he had seen the most bizarre things happen whenever the ninth family would choose to fight. On top of that, it was the only ability that Logan found nearly impossible to replicate in the game.

Muka said it was alright because her ability would work even when in the game. Either way, Logan did put in some things that should act similar to how her ability would work.

When the break was over, Muka walked over to the Butler and requested something.

"Excuse me," Muka said. "Please tell them that there is no point in me participating in this fight. If they wish to see a spectacle and see my true power, then I will be happy to, but I am unable to fight in this match."

The Butler looked at Muka for a few seconds as if she was joking, but since none of the other leaders had said anything, including 'Quinn', he had decided to make the call. It was up to the Board to settle.

"It doesn't matter too much anyway; we've nearly seen all of the vampire leaders fight, so we can grant them their wish," Andy replied.

It was a surprise, but Muka was forfeited from the match, and instead, there was someone else to take their place. At the same time, she would take part in the next match.

"Worried?" Nicu asked.

"About what?" Muka replied.

"That if a royal knight was to lose to a vampire knight, there would be an uproar. It would be an embarrassment to your family." Nicu said, although he was being a bit more cautious with his words than usual. Perhaps due to the result of his own fight.

Muka started to laugh.

"No…you see, I knew that they would accept my request; after all, that is also part of my power. I have had a string of very bad luck lately. My vampire knights dying and everything happening to my family and more… I think my luck should soon turn around."

As expected, it wasn't easy to talk to Muka when they went off about their powers, and since Nicu didn't really have a leg to stand on from his earlier comments, he chose to stay quiet as well.

The machine went off again, and this time the leader it had landed on was Lee. He would be the one to face Leo instead. Nonetheless, it was an exciting match that would soon take place.

——

Having just exited from the strange lab, Quinn walked down the hallway expecting to find someone who could give him some answers. What he didn't expect to see was Nathan, one of the Earthborn generals, to be here.

"Quinn, you know what will happen if they catch you out of the grounds like so? They might think that you were planning to sabotage this whole event or plotting against someone… this could start a war!" Nathan said, genuinely concerned.

He looked frightened and even now was turning his head constantly to see if there was anyone following them.

"I want to ask you the same question," Quinn replied. "I have a replacement taking my place, but you, how are you here, and what are you doing heading in this direction in the first place?"

It was clear that Nathan was heading to the strange lab; there was nowhere else to go in that direction but that.

"The Board seems to trust me a bit, or I guess I should say they have been bossing me around a lot," Nathan replied. "They told me to get you in the first place, and now they ordered me to head to this area and report back to them. Apparently, they noticed that there was some kind of movement. Now that I see you're here, I guess you must have set off something which caused them to be alarmed."

It was likely true; after all, Quinn had given up on his shadow cloak while in the facility and many other places, but he had seen no cameras.

'Maybe they had sensors or something like that… it's hard to tell, but the good thing is, it looks like they don't know it's me if they only sent Nathan.'

"Do you know what is going on in this facility?" Quinn asked.

Nathan shook his head.

"Remember, I'm not part of the Board. I was sent to work for you by Oscar, and now I'm partly under you and the Supreme commander Sach. Why… Did you find something?"

Quinn wasn't so sure that he should be quick to tell. If it were Sam or someone he could trust, he would have, but not Nathan. However, he thought maybe the latter could help him with a few other things instead.

"You've been here before…right? Can you take me around this place? Help me to see if there is anything that I've missed. Maybe places that require access codes that you couldn't get in before?" Quinn asked.

It looked like Nathan was seriously thinking about Quinn's request, if he should just tell Quinn that this was a bad idea and they should go back, but in the end, he let out a big sigh.

"I guess I can help you out. I too, think something big is going on. The Board is clearly hiding something." Nathan said as he walked ahead and allowed Quinn to follow.

After a few steps, though, Quinn started to receive a call through his mask.

"Quinn, I have an urgent message for you."

He could recognize the voice on the other end.

It was Sam.

"Whatever you do… don't trust Nathan."

*****

# Chapter 1434 - Impossible Challenge
After Sam's little talk with Layla and Nate, the three of them figured it would be best for them to find out about the situation before jumping to any conclusions. Which meant the best thing for them to do was to go out there and capture one of the 'military members' whom they suspected to be a member of Pure.

'I have my Influence skill, but I'm not the best at it, and the other guys aren't much better than me at it either.' Sam thought as he wondered what to do. Still, they could always just try to do it the old-fashioned way.

Inside the large hanger, Sam had called for a meeting and used one of the crates as a type of table for all the members to gather around. There was nothing on the crate nor any use for it. It just made him feel comfortable meeting with the others this way.

'Why does this feel so comfortable?'

"You really like your meetings, don't you?" Nate joked, since he never imagined the first thing they would be doing was another meeting straight after.

"It's the quickest way to update everyone on the situation and to make them aware. We came here together, and everyone's life is at risk as long as they are here, so I think it's fair that everyone has the same set of information." Sam answered earnestly, which Nate wasn't expecting from the little jab he had given.

After that, Sam had explained what their suspicions were. So, for now, they just wanted to capture one of them.

"And if we are caught?" Raten asked.

"What do you mean?" Sam frowned.

"If one of us gets caught during this thing…what do you want us to do?"

"Then…we do everything in our power to get them back," Layla shrugged.

"Let's just hope it doesn't come to that…I don't want to bring too much attention to ourselves." Sam replied. "In the first place, if they were aware of us being here, they could very well believe that we are up to something, and it could harm Quinn and the rest of them.

"We would have to try to take them all out before they could make a report, which seems impossible."

"That just makes me want to try even more," Raten replied.

Two people seemed to be best for the job. One of them was Dennis. This was because out of everyone in the meeting, he was one of the better ones when using the shadow power.

None of them were on Quinn's level and never thought they would be, but Dennis had learned how to use the skill Shadow Cloak. He had demonstrated it in front of everyone, and they could see a slight outline if they were to pay attention.

As for the second option, it was little Borden. With the Dragon, Logan created a serum that would last longer but not permanently change him back; still, in this situation, his small size was perfect, and with his sudden strength, he should be able to take someone out with ease.

In the end, the two of them decided to go; in the first place, Sam thought it would be better if they went as backups in pairs and to look out for each other.

Right now, they were heading towards the rest of the base. There were several hangers and groups of people running around. The two had decided to go a long way around, walking outside of the base area.

This was all on Sam's suggestion, of course. Then they would approach from a different side. Eventually, they reached multiple hangers and walked outside its large metal exterior. There were gaps between them, and someone had filled these gaps with crates of countless supplies.

For the two of them, though, it was perfect for disguising and covering themselves from being exposed. Even with the Shadow cloak on, Dennis crouched behind one of the crates, and Borden hopped onto the top of it confidently.

"What are you doing?" Dennis whispered.

"Relax, those guys aren't going to notice me; look how far away they are. Besides, it seems like boredom has gotten the better of them.

Dennis actually knew what Borden meant because the soldiers seemed to be having a little fun right now. They were piloting Mechs and having a little fight with each other while the others around them were cheering widely.

"We only need one of them. So let's try to look for someone who's secluded." Borden said.

The two scanned, looking to see if there was anyone. The atmosphere certainly seemed more relaxed than any military bases that Dennis had seen before, which meant that some of them were celebrating a little early with some drinks.

The smell had reached Dennis' nose, allowing him to move between hangers until they had found exactly what they were looking for. A lone soldier who looked to be drinking on his own.

"So, what's the plan?" Dennis asked.

This was when he could see little Borden already running to where the soldier was. He quickly jumped up and punched the back of the man's neck with his hand, and it caused the soldier to flop and fall off the small toolbox he was sitting on, with his face planted on the floor.

Dennis couldn't believe it. What if someone saw them? He thought that maybe Borden wasn't the best person to bring along on this type of mission, after all.

'The only one with half a brain out of the Blade family is Vorden, but I thought Borden was a clone created from him? Or maybe this little guy got all three of their Genes and personality causing him to be a little different.'

Dennis's guess wasn't quite right. The real reason was that Borden had just been hanging around his brothers for a little too long, and he had gained quite the influence from one of them in particular.

Seeing the situation in front of, Dennis, in a panic, quickly went to pick up the body. Thinking if someone saw it, they would be in some serious trouble. When touching it, he realised that his shadow cloak had deactivated.

'Damn it, this is going horribly, but if I just run back!' As he carried the man on his back, Dennis thought and proceeded to head through the hanger.

But just as he had taken two steps.

"Hey, over there!" A person shouted.

It was clear they had been exposed, and it was in Dennis' instinct to just keep running for some reason. They had run through the small gap, with the knocked-out soldier on their back.

"We made it!" Dennis thought as he stepped out from the trap and was out on the grass field again, away from the base.

But a few seconds later, he felt rumbling as a large object landed in front of him.

It was one of the giant mechs.

Although Dennis was frozen with what to do, it was clear the soldiers had caught them, and it seemed like the mission was a complete failure. Just then, something small jumped past him, and he could see Borden in the air.

"Get out of the way!" Borden shouted as he punched the centre of the Mech.

Its centrepiece was crushed to pieces.

"See, mission success." Borden landed smiling while the Mech lay there on the floor behind him.

However, soon ships began to move, and soldiers were getting into the mechs behind them.

If they didn't hurry, the situation might become unpredictable.

——

At the same time, the others were watching everything, and as they saw all the soldiers moving out, Sam couldn't help but facepalm.

"Well, it looks like they were caught,"

Besides him, someone had a huge grin as he walked forward.

"Well, let's get them back then." It was Raten.

The group prepared themselves for an upcoming fight against the military base of possibly two hundred soldiers or more. While on the cursed faction side, they had Layla, Sam, Nate, Linda, Vorden, Raten, and Peter with his two Lesser Weights.

"Let's see if we can take this whole base over quickly then."

*****

# Chapter 1435 - Qi A Weakness
The next fight was underway, and on the human side there were many that recognised the nickname that had been given to the Blind swordsman, in particular those among the Unranked.

"I've always looked up to him as one of the Heroes of War. Back then, he was one of the few people that were actually able to deal with a Dalki." The one speaking was the man with the sleeveless shirt and hood up over his head. "He was impressive in the past, but a lot has changed since that time, and not much news has come out about him since.

"I wonder, did he go into hiding?"

"I don't think that would be the case." A young unranked named Albed spoke. He had a special type of bow on his back, golden in colour. Unfortunately, there hadn't been much chance for him to use it since he had lost his match fairly quickly. "I mean, he got invited here, right? So there has to be a reason."

As the others started to speak, they did find it strange that the Blind Swordsman was here, just like the other Unranked mentioned. Leo hadn't achieved anything great since the first war.

Meanwhile, in the room where all the members of the Board were, a discussion along the same line was being held. Among the younger generation, most didn't agree that Leo had actually deserved an invitation.

"It was none of us that invited him, but Pure were the ones who insisted that the Blind Swordsman get an invitation. So perhaps we will find out the reason why in this very fight." One of the older members on the Board explained.

The reason for the invite was all due to the large red-headed man. Maybe the others didn't know the current strength of the Blind Swordsman, but he did. Having fought side by side with him to take on a four spiked Dalki.

'I have improved a lot since our fight together, it's a shame that the two of us are on the same side. I would have preferred to test for myself how much you've improved since then. I just hope your opponent can help me see your skills.' Chris thought.

——

Entering the stage, everyone was wondering what type of field would appear next. It was exciting seeing so many locations being used as arenas, and it would serve as good practice for all the different atmospheres that covered the beast planets.

Depending on who exactly was fighting, certain terrains might offer one side an advantage over the other. Trees started to appear on the field, with leaves covering the entire ground. This fight's location appeared to be an endless forest.

Most of the trees were three to four times taller than an average human, not too big, but not too small either. Seeing this, people didn't know if it was an advantage for the Blind Swordsman or not.

The leaves should make it easy for him to locate his opponent, as the sound one made when stepping on them would be a tell-tale sign, but at the same time, his opponent might use them to cover his attacks.

"What do you think of this fight?" Jin asked, standing by Vincent's side, since their 'King' seemed to have a good idea about the strength of the human contestants. All of his predictions had turned out to be correct so far. What they didn't know was that he knew everything that Quinn knew. Which was why he knew the others' powers well.

"You think it would be embarrassing if a Vampire knight of the tenth family would beat a leader, don't you? I guess if the other vampires heard of something like this, people would start claiming that the tenth family had the strongest vampires." Vincent smiled.

"Well, someone sounds like they are sure about who is going to win." Sunny also entered the conversation, standing next to Vincent.

"Lee is a strange leader. His strength seems nearly impossible to gauge. At times, I feel like he could beat anyone, while at other times, it feels like any of the other leaders could beat him."

In the end, the group would just have to watch the match and find out.

The match had begun, and almost instantly both sides were running towards each other. The scene reminded everyone of the first fight today.

Eventually, though, Lee stopped, moving his fingers at a rapid pace. It was impossible for the others through the glass container to see what exactly he was doing, but they soon noticed that the Blind Swordsman started to act strange.

When a few metres away from Lee he had already drawn out his sword, which he then seemingly used to slash the air, before he quickly moved to the side, constantly attacking the air. The others watching found it strange, It looked like Leo was going up against an invisible enemy.

"For a supposedly blind man, you sure do see a lot!" Lee commented smiling, revealing that Leo could see all the invisible strings he had set up. This meant that the leader would have to change his plans. The next set of strings he produced were red in colour.

Lee soon wrapped it around a tree, and with his great strength managed to uproot it from the ground, hurling it towards Leo. Seeing this, the Vampire knight had to put more power into his blade, but he made sure to only use Qi and avoid using blood aura.

Since most of them didn't know about him no longer being human, he thought it would be best to keep it that way. A simple tree was easy enough for him to cut. With a strike, it split in half and the power from the throw made it so that both parts missed him.

However, behind one set of trees was another. Still, for Leo whose vision wasn't limited to what was directly in front of him, he had already been prepared. The Blind Swordsman had already leapt in the air, jumping over the second tree.

"It is a shame that I can't fight you at your full strength. I think it would have been a more worthy battle." Leo shouted to Lee.

He knew what he meant, Leo knew that they had blood weapons that they couldn't use, and in the first place, the thirteenth's family's strength came from puppeteering someone, which he was unable to do in this fight as well.

"It is the same for you." Lee smiled, knowing that Leo also wanted to be able to use his soul weapon. The two of them knew this fight was pointless to them. Because of this, Leo decided to use something that would catch the thirteenth leader off guard, yet at the same time prepare him for something else.

First, Leo struck his sword four times while in the air. They were Qi infused strikes, leaving his blade out. Seeing this, Lee tried to combat them with his Blood swipes, but that wasn't where the real threat was in the first place.

With his other hand free, Leo punched the air, and in doing so, an invisible force had left him. After blocking the strikes, Lee had seen nothing yet he suddenly felt a large pain in his stomach.

'The third stage of Qi is something the vampires need to be wary of. Qi serves as a strong counter to vampires, and the third stage is even worse than the other two.' Leo thought.

He already stood above Lee with his sword above his head.

"Let's end this pointless game." Leo said, pressing it down on his neck causing the match to end.

While the human side was happy for another victory on 'their' side, the vampires weren't sure if this one should count for the tenth family, the humans or the vampires.

'Although the vampires have seen the powers of the others, Pure's power is something that is hard to gauge, and yet it might become the most troublesome thing for the vampires in the future. Quinn, if you want to protect the vampires as well, you need to think of this aspect.' Leo made a mental note to speak to the Cursed faction leader about it in the future.

Before his avatar disappeared, Leo looked up at Chris, who had a smile on his face. He could see that the Blind Swordsman had improved in many ways. However, most impressive was the he had learned how to utilise the third stage of Qi.

'I wonder…you have your soul weapon, but if you were to use it the same way as Pure does, the fourth stage, how much of a monster would you be? I hope you got to see everything you wanted to see, Zero.

'With this much, I guess it's time for us to wrap up this little game.'

*****

# Chapter 1436 - Betrayed
Inside the military base, there was a hanger stationed near the centre, where a figure was currently enjoying a smoke. He was wearing a beast armour chest piece, and indented in white, a clear contrast to the black armour, was the number twelve. The seat he was on was awfully shaky, yet he didn't allow that to disturb him from his cigar.

"It sounds like your guys are having a lot of trouble dealing with a few intruders." Agent 12 complained as he heard the noise in the distance. "No wonder it was so easy to take over your base. If we had the power to do this all along, Pure should have done something about it a long time ago."

Finishing his cigar, he placed the butt of it on his seat and started to twist and turn it, causing his 'seat' to scream in pain. The Pure agent hadn't been sitting on a normal chair, no, he had forced the Sergeant that used to be in charge of this particular platoon to take on that role. This was a complete embarrassment to the military man. A great, respected figure like him was now being treated as nothing but a chair, yet he had no choice.

"I guess, you guys really can't do anything without us." Agent 12 finally stood up, and the others in the hanger looked to be ready with their weapons in hand. All smiling, a group of twenty of them in total.

'You bastards! How dare you treat a member of the military like this? Where was your fanatical group when we got attacked by the Dalki? Hiding, like the cockroaches you are! One day, you Pure bastards will get what's coming to you.' The sergeant thought to himself, thankful that he no longer had to allow himself to be humiliated.

"Let's move out!" Agent 12 shouted as he held up his mace in the air. The twenty men soon cleared out with him and began to run out of the hanger. The Pure agent wasn't too far behind them, but when he went out, he was wondering why his men had seemingly frozen in place.

"What are you guys doing? Find the intruders and get rid of…them." His voice trailed off, as he looked at the scene in front of him.

Even now, the fighting continued to take place, yet the hangers were completely destroyed. Countless Mechs had been ripped apart. Not only that, but the men that had been stationed here were lying around defeated. Some members had been Pure agents, and they weren't exactly weak ones either.

An explosion went off, followed by another, but they appeared to be in different directions.

"Find them and bring their heads to me!" Agent 12 shouted, and the rest seemed to agree. The groups split into two following one set of explosions. While searching, they noticed that the damage was even worse than it had initially looked. How many people had been sent here? Did they have an equal force of around two hundred? Had the Earthborn group retaliated?

'If it's the Earthborn group who are here to save their people, they would need at least a force twice as large as ours to do this much. If that's the case, we might have no other choice but to retreat.' Agent 12 thought.

However, he soon noticed something strange. If the invaders had such a large force, where were the bodies of their enemies? So far all they had seen were their own members. No matter how experienced the fighters on the other side would be, it should be impossible to suffer zero casualties.

That was when he could see up ahead. A group of six Mechs had surrounded three people in their midst.

'Great, it looks like they have captured some of them! We need to capture them alive, so we can interrogate them and find out more about their plans.' Agent 12 decided.

When getting closer though, he noticed that the ones piloting the Mechs were strangely trying to back away. However, they seemed afraid to turn their back, and he soon understood why. Immediately, one of the three charged forward and formed his hand into a giant blade, with a single slice the Mech's arm was destroyed. The other mech rushed forward trying to help him. When a piece from the attacker's own arm was shot out and hit the Mech's legs. The substance appeared gooey like mud at first but hardened in an instant.

Looking closer, he noticed that one of the figures didn't look human at all, instead, it resembled a beast with a human body. It dived straight into the Mech's centre, hitting it with a strong force of wind. The Mech was lifted into the air to crash into the ground, unable to move again.

'Wait…that is definitely a beast… Does that mean we are being attacked by beasts? And humanoid beasts at that?!' Agent 12 wondered.

Still, with the surrounding ten, he was afraid and charged forward. The third person was a girl. She stood between the two beasts, unafraid, and drew her bow. Agent 12 wasn't afraid, they were hundreds of metres away, there was no way she could hit them from this distance, and it would be even hard to see them.

As the woman let go of the bow, three arrows came out, and it was heading straight for them at a considerable speed. Lifting his mace, Agent 12 was ready to block the attacks… yet at the last second they slightly moved. He was quick enough to react to the attack, blocking it with the head of his mace.

'What is this power? …is this Qi?! …but who knows Qi and has any connection to beasts? None of this makes ANY SENSE!!!'

He saw two of his men had fallen to the ground, the other two arrows having pierced their hearts. As for him, something strange was happening to the arrow as it connected to the weapon. It started to spin and the force of Qi increased rapidly.

His Qi was losing out, and he was hit, falling to the floor, looking at his weapon that had been shattered.

'Who are these people? …no, that's not important! I have to warn the others! I need to tell them about this!' Getting on his receiver, he was ready to call them, until he could see what looked like a human child by his side.

He saw the boy smile, and eventually he stomped on his hand, crushing his bones to pieces. It then leapt and landed on his other hand, crushing that as well.

Agent 12 didn't understand how a human child who looked no bigger than a puppy could have such strength. No longer being able to use his hands, he tried to make sense of this situation. The more he thought about it, the more he was convinced that all of this had to be one horrible nightmare.

"It looks like you actually cleared the place Raten, that is impressive." A voice was heard from behind. Tilting his head and moving his eyes, Agent 12 could see a larger group walking forward, they had come from the other direction, where his men had gone. What was worse, it looked like some of them were carrying his men on their backs.

"You guys had more people!" Raten complained. "Of course you would clear your side quicker!"

"Actually, we didn't do anything." Linda corrected him. "Most of it was actually Peter, and his two 'friends'."

The others, who were with Peter, had seen the frightening display of power. The two Lesser Weights by his side were truly monsters. Legs, formerly the five spike Dalki known as Slicer, and what was left of Hilston, but what was even more scary was Peter himself, who now had the same stats as Quinn but at the same time, his regenerative power was even beyond the Vampire King.

Because of this, the others didn't really have to do anything. Anyone they came across got beaten before they could even join in the fight.

"So this guy here is the highest ranking member, right?" Sam asked.

"I found another one!" Nate shouted from far back, and he had the Sergeant from earlier held by the back of his shirt.

"Wait, hear me out, I'm not one of them!" The sergeant cried. "Please believe me! I'm not part of Pure. You guys, I recognise some of you. I've seen you on the livestream, you're the Cursed faction, right?! Please listen to me, these guys they captured us… and that damn Nathan… that rotten guy betrayed us all!"

Immediately, this became something that Sam was very interested in hearing. He had a suspicion. In the first place, Nathan was from the military, he had been told to escort Quinn and the others. He should have known that this wasn't a real base, that these weren't real soldiers, so why hadn't he said anything?

"You! Tell me everything that happened and what you know!" Sam demanded, with his eyes glowing red.

# Chapter 1437 - What Side Are You On?
There were many reasons for the special event to take place. More than anything, the Board and the humans were getting out of these fights was information. They found out exactly what vampires' abilities and blood skills could do. It was also giving them a grasp of their strength as well.

Even if most of the human side had lost their fights quickly, it meant that at least in the future, they could try and prepare countermeasures against such a situation if the vampires were ever to attack and turn on them.

One thing that stood out more than anything was their use of abilities, how it differed from those that the humans had. All of the abilities that the leaders had used so far were not available to humans, and some of them seemed to be quite powerful as well.

Of course, for the Board members in their heads, they were already imagining other humans with these abilities and were trying to figure out ways they could convince the other side for this information.

This was one of the reasons that the Board had accepted the request of the Ninth leader. Since the leader said she would show a spectacle, they were all quite excited to see what she had in mind.

Before her match began, Muka once again began to spin her coin out on the table in the room. This time, the coin had landed on the head's side. Picking this up, she walked forward and was ready to start the game.

The machine displayed the faces of those who hadn't yet fought from the human side. Mona, the sleeveless unranked, Chris, Agent 3, and Grim were left to go, and finally, it had landed on Grim Graylash -The ex-leader of the Graylash family.

Muka had no idea of the strength of all her opponents, but still, she believed in her 'Luck' and decided to head into the VR machine, ready to start the match.

Before the match had started, the old man on the Board who had been sitting down most of the time stood up and started to walk away from the others.

"Mr Watson, where are you going?" Andy called out to him.

"Well, I have a very important matter to deal with, don't worry, I will return soon. It is important we know all our enemies." The old man said while exiting the room.

As usual, the terrain started to load before the match commenced. For the first time between all the matches, the room had gone dark, as it emulated the place being nighttime. Soon a black substance started to appear, and on one side, the ground slightly rose.

Eventually, something like a fortress appeared. All humans knew what this was; this was similar to a Dalki fortress. At times they would use these games and maps to help simulate real-life battles for the military, which was why it was put in.

However, there was something strange for those carefully observing the recent matches. The map in particular that appeared, the fortress had only appeared on one side, while on the other, there was nothing. Just empty black land.

When the map had finished generating, there stood Muka in her heavy black armour, on top of the fortress walls placed on a mountain. She had a height and aerial advantage and the fortress's defence.

While Grim, on the other side, had open terrain to get through, with nothing to protect him at all.

"How is this fair!" Albed shouted. "This match has to be rigged. The terrain is in one person's favour! They should change the map and fight again!"

Many of them in the room were in agreement, but Sach spoke up.

"In a fight, we will never have a complete fair advantage. There will be times when we will be faced with this exact situation. That was why we created the map in the first place. Many of you when you fought, had the advantage of the area; even Owen had used it to win his match."

"Should we restart that match as well?!" Sach exclaimed.

Hearing his words, the others really couldn't argue, and the Unranked Albed just tutted as he continued to watch the match.

"I guess Grim got the short end of the stick this time." He murmured. "That ninth leader is just lucky."

————

It turned out that there was no need for Sam to use his influence skill on the sergeant. He was ready to spill the beans on everything that had happened so far. How Pure had taken control over one of the military bases, and how Nathan of all people was the one who had brought them right to their doorstep.

To put it simply, from everything Sam had heard, Nathan had betrayed the Earthborn group. Hearing this, he immediately decided to inform Quinn of the matter. He wasn't sure if Nathan had been part of Pure since the beginning, or if they were threatening him, or maybe it was some deal, but none of that mattered.

Right now, his actions were endangering the lives of others, and that included Quinn. Sam didn't know where the latter was or what he was doing, but he needed to tell him.

-----

Quinn had received the message clearly, but he had yet to say anything. He continued to follow Nathan, who was now leading them towards the South section of the arena. This was in the opposite direction from the North section where the Board members were seated. It was also the only empty part of the stadium where no contestants or anyone else was positioned, which was why Quinn never tried to go there, believing that there would be nothing there.

'If what Sam said is true, and Nathan is working for Pure, then should I keep on following him? If that is the case, it's clear he could be leading me into a trap right now. At the same time, if I stay silent, he might bring me to the people I need to see.' Quinn mused.

'That's the spirit; I mean, when you're in this situation, why does it matter if you fall into a trap!' Ray encouraged his ancestor. 'Just blast your way through any problem that appears!'

Quinn wondered how long Nathan had been on the Pure's side. Was it something that recently happened, or perhaps he has always been one, since their time at school? Leo could sense Qi, and he would have noticed if something was up.

However, only high-ranking Pure members would learn Qi, but it was hard to see why they wouldn't have taught Nathan Qi. At the same time, he had an ability as well.

"I remember that just like the North area, they had a room that looked similar to the one you left from. Maybe you will be able to find something there." Nathan said as he continued to look left and right.

"So that's where are you taking me, to the other facility on the South section?" Quinn replied.

"Yeah, but we have to hurry but be cautious at the same time. The longer I'm away, the more suspicious they will get."

Seeing Nathan, someone he had known since his school days, like this, was painful; it was as if he knew every word of Nathan's was a lie. Now that he thought about it more, Quinn could even hear his heartbeat changing slightly every time he said something different.

"And are you sure there won't be any surprises when I arrive there?" Quinn asked.

"What do you mean?" Nathan nervously chuckled, his heart thumping faster.

"Nathan, you know my hearing is sensitive and more sensitive than you could imagine, and it's to the point that I can even hear slight changes in it when you speak. So I will ask you a question, and I'll know if you have told me the truth, but I just want to hear it from you.

"Where are you always in Pure…or are they somehow forcing you." Quinn straight up asked. This wasn't a game, but these people were treating others' lives as one, and Quinn wanted to take no part in it.

# Chapter 1438 - Muka's Power
With no valid complaints, the fight was about to start, as all the others had done. Muka stayed on top of the wall, where she could see her opponent standing in the distance. He similarly wore robes like all the others in the Graylash family, though Grim tended to have both his hands in his sleeves.

'The hardest part isn't the fortress, but it's the high ground itself.' The former Graylash leader thought, as he calculated the optimal way to tackle the difficult situation. 'I never thought I would have to think so much and fight as hard as this during my age.'

Running forward, there wasn't much Grim could do. There was no secret way he could suddenly teleport over. The lightning ability, while certainly powerful, only had a limited range where one could use their Lightning Travel skill.

A skill that allowed the user to move as if they themselves became a bolt of lightning. The reason for this was because there were actually two movements to the skill. The first was forming their body and shooting it upwards in a lightning bolt form. Then, once they reached sufficient height, they would have to use the skill to shoot themselves down towards the ground.

The range for how far they could move was limited when in this form, and it was why it was an impractical movement method. Nevertheless, it was great to use during a fight, as it not only allowed him to avoid his enemies, but he could also use it to get right behind them.

Still, there was a problem and Grim knew it as well, for he could see a red aura coming his way. Attacking downward was far easier, and he had yet to even see Muka clearly.

"I have to admit, I'm a little jealous. Those eyes of yours seem to be pretty good, I bet they don't deteriorate even with old age. I guess being a vampire really has its advantages!" Grim spoke, as he began to act. His body started to electrify itself with a constant shock. Rather than trying to hit and avoid the red lines of aura, since he had seen his grandson able to block the attacks of his opponent, he too decided to just run forward.

From the spectator's perspective, he looked like a barrier of armour made from lightning, and was even attacking the ground around him as he moved. When the red aura hit the lightning barrier, the force of it struck at the aura in front, breaking it apart, causing it to disperse into little red particles.

Seeing this, Muka still didn't panic, and instead held out her open palm.

"I guess trying to fight head on, wasn't the right idea." Muka said.

Red aura started to gather in her palm, once it was ready she looked down, aiming at Grim himself, yet before releasing her attack, she adjusted it slightly ahead of where he would be. Even if she was to calculate his speed, this was too far ahead, but that was because Muka never intended to hit Grim. She had more chance if she was trying to not hit him.

A large blast left her palm, and her arm was chucked back as the Blood canon was used. It was the first time that the Board and the leaders were seeing such an attack. A constant stream, more powerful than any of the past attacks they had seen from the vampires.

As for why the other leaders hadn't used it, that was simple. In the fights so far, they either hadn't needed to, lacked the chance to use it, or it hadn't been the optimal skill to use. It was a skill that took some preparation time, after all.

Seeing it, at first Grim was prepared to use his Lightning Travel to avoid the attack, or his Spinning Bolt, but he could see that the attack wasn't aimed at him, which greatly confused him. As such, he chose to trust his judgement and not do anything.

The Blood canon hit the ground, and it blasted into hundreds of small pieces. At the same time, these pieces started to fall and all of them headed towards Grim. It was a little too late for him to notice what exactly Muka had planned, and now that all the rocks that went his way they were setting off his electrified armour.

It was an automatic skill that attacked anything that got too close, and due to how many rocks there were, it created an opening. Grim didn't know when, but the vampire leader had already leapt through the air, and was falling towards Grim's position.

He understood that due to his armour reacting to the rocks, he was wide open for an attack. The good news was, that it didn't matter. Grim's body soon started to shine brightly blue and the next second he disappeared.

'This skill… it's the same one the one fighting Jin used, but it seems like none of you are as strong as that kid.' Muka thought as she took a mace off her back and threw it in a random direction.

At that moment, another bolt of lightning was seen coming down from the sky. It hit the ground and Grim appeared in its place, the only thing was the mace that had been thrown was already an inch away from his face and there was nothing he could do.

It ploughed into his face, causing him to fall to the ground. The throw had the strength of someone with a strength type ability.

'How did you know where I was going to be?' Grim wondered.

The truth was, Muka hadn't known.

'It looks like my luck is indeed working in here and even more so than I thought. While I expected it to hit him, I didn't think it would be his head.'

The game was currently simulating the damage that had been done to Grim. Which concluded that his eye had been critically hit, impairing his vision slightly. With that, the fight would resume, and what followed was a close combat on the side of the mountain.

Owen and Hermes were carefully watching from above.

"Do you think your grandfather can win?" Hermes asked. "Before you came along, your grandfather was considered one of the strongest lightning ability users."

"He's already lost this match." Owen replied instantly and confidently. "Although what you say is true, most of that is due to his soul weapon. At the time we fought that five spiked Dalki, if he didn't have that we would have been in serious trouble. Unfortunately, this is just a simulated match, so he's unable to use it. However, even if he was, there is something very strange about this whole fight.

"My grandfather uses his head far more than me, while I prefer to just go with the flow around me. Yet, in this fight I can see the look on his face, he seems to understand what is happening. Every time he uses the Lightning Travel, his opponent manages to find him somehow. It's only a matter of time until this match ends."

Owen's prediction was correct, as the match came to an end right then and there, with Muka being the winner. Other than the Blood canon, there had been no other impressive moves from the ninth leader, at least not anything they hadn't seen before.

Nevertheless, in this fight, the former ninth leader had somehow managed to make the Graylash family's ability appear like it was no threat at all. The vampire fighter hadn't even suffered a single hit, making some believe that the first fight might have just been a match up for the vampire side.

Meanwhile, the vampire leaders who had watched the fight were shivering slightly at the thought of going up against her. Fighting the Royal knight… it would be a strange experience to have to say the least, but of course, faced with overwhelming power, against someone like Quinn or Laxmus, this type of luck would eventually run out.

Muka casually got out from her pod and walked over to Vincent, resuming her duty to protect their King. They all waited and watched for the next result carefully. However, the vampires already knew who was left, and to nobody's surprise the screen listed Quinn Talen as the next fighter.

Seeing this, Vincent let out a sigh, but just waited for who his opponent would be, and finally it had landed on the hooded Unranked figure.

'That… that is the one that has the power of the god.' Vincent recalled. 'I was hoping that you would be back by the time your turn came up, so you could fight yourself. Or perhaps you would have witnessed the power of the god. It's a shame that I have to go up against him. What is taking you so long…'

In the end, Vincent had no choice but to participate.

# Chapter 1439 - The Return Of Him
Standing between the north and south part of the stadium, through the gigantic hallways that seemed never ending, were Quinn and Nathan. The Cursed faction leader was waiting for his guide to start speaking, however, the other hesitated. It was so silent, that all Quinn could hear were the sounds of his own and mostly Nathan's body.

"You know I can force the information out of you, right?" Quinn pointed out. "However, you've earned my respect that I would rather not do that. Back at school, when Duke used to be in charge, and all the students were being mistreated by him, you were the only one who stood up to him. Back then, it felt to me like you always wanted to do something about it, but you just lacked the power to make a change.

"Which is why I don't want to believe you're entirely a bad person. I know unlike the others you don't have that strange Qi surrounding your head, if you did Leo would have spotted it. As such, I know that you're at least not forced to do what you're doing." Quinn's eyes started to glow red, he wasn't using his Influence skill just yet, but he knew how to channel the red aura, so his eyes would have this effect.

Seeing them, and feeling the power coming out from Quinn in this proximity, Nathan hesitated. In his eyes, he wasn't just seeing a young man.

"I'm sorry Quinn… I hate having to do this." Nathan finally spoke up. "You're right, at the school I was weak, but I had risen to my position due to my hard work, and my unique powers, but I couldn't do anything then, and now… I seem to have ended up under an entirely different 'Duke'.

"I wasn't always part of Pure… I mean…I still am not sure if I technically am one, but it's true that I have been helping them for a while now."

While Nathan was speaking, Quinn made sure to listen to his heart to see if there were any changes. Honestly, he had no clue what reaction a heart would make when one was lying, or whether one's heart would start beating differently just due to the situation. All of those words had been a bluff, but his instincts were telling him the other wasn't lying.

"Are you willingly helping them, or not?" Quinn asked for clarification. Maybe he wasn't part of Pure before but what about now? When did it all start? There were times when his people, the Cursed faction, had greatly relied on Nathan.

"In a way, but not outright." Nathan replied, the look on his face being one of pure guilt. "Quinn, all I can say is that you will understand once you see him. Pure… they have been involved in everything from the start without any of us even suspecting anything.

"I don't know what their end goal is, all I know is that they wanted me to take you to them. I honestly don't know if this is a trap… no, I guess it's pretty obvious it can't be anything else. What I mean is, I have no clue what they have in store for you."

This was the end, Nathan had failed his task, and he thought there was no way that Quinn would follow him now. Knowing it was a trap, and because of his actions today, there was a good chance that a big war would soon start.

"Who's 'they'?" Quinn asked.

"The person who organised this whole event." Nathan replied. "Zero."

Nathan didn't know why he was telling Quinn everything, but it just felt like that he should know everything now, even though he was sure that it was all over.

"Take me to him, and pretend that this conversation never happened." Quinn requested with a smile. "Once all of this is over, you'll have a lot of explaining to do."

Hearing this, Nathan didn't know how to feel, but there was a growing pain in his chest that couldn't bear the situation that he had been put in. He continued to walk and as Quinn said, he resumed walking behind him. However, the distance between the two of them had grown.

'Huh… well, I guess that's only to be expected.' Nathan thought, clenching his fists.

The actual reason why Quinn had distanced himself, though, wasn't because of Nathan. It was due to him getting in contact with a certain group that had been left behind. Quinn had been given an update on what Sam and the others had learned and asked what he wanted them to do next.

They had a ship prepared and were ready to leave at any moment. Just in case, Quinn asked for them to be prepared to come at a moment's notice. If they could perhaps start to move a bit now, yet they would have to make sure they would remain unseen.

'Zero… so I'll finally get to meet you. Were you the one that was using Qi drain on all of those people? Are you responsible for the Qi command? Because if you are… I don't think we'll be able to reach any common ground.'

————

On the human side, the hooded man had entered his VR game. He was one of the many Unranked that had arrived. In all honesty, a lot of the Unranked were less impressive than others had imagined.

They had been told stories of their strength, being compared to that of the Big Four, but it seemed to not be true at all. Perhaps these were rumours spread by their rich employers, hoping to scare off any attackers.

They were strong, but not at the level of someone like Sil or Owen who they had seen fight so far. Which was why, no one had expected anything from this figure. That included those from the vampire leaders.

"Will he be okay?" Sunny asked.

"He has our King's body. Although he may not have his ability or Blood control, you've also trained alongside him. He was more impressive than any of us." Jim replied.

The stage started to materialise once again, yet this time there didn't seem to be anything noteworthy about the arena. The ground was hard and dry, giving off an orange or brown look. There were no trees or water, just an empty surrounding.

It meant, unlike the last fights, that these two wouldn't be able to use the area to their advantage. In other words, they would have to resort to their skills, and everyone was looking forward to a good display.

Finally, the Unranked appeared, and so did Vincent.

"It should be a walk in the park for Quinn, right?" Hermes asked.

"Perhaps, but we don't know how much of his powers had been transferred in the game. On top of that, he might not use his full powers. If I was him, I wouldn't reveal my full strength here, instead I'd rather use this as a training opportunity by limiting myself. Of course, that depends on whether that Unranked guy can keep up."

Laughter came from one of the Unranked, and it was the young man with a bow on his back named Albad.

"You guys really don't know any of us Unranked, do you?" Albad asked. "Look, I saw the video you all of you guys did, but trust me when I say this, that man is different from the rest of us. No matter what happens or who he has fought, he always comes out surviving no matter what."

The others thought that maybe he was just bragging due to them being friends, but if that was the case they would find out soon anyway, so what was the need to brag. Perhaps his friend really was that strong.

Hearing this as well, Sil assumed that the strong power that he had been given, the large amount of MC cells, had to have come from him.

Back on the field, the two stood opposite each other and the match had started, but neither one had made their move.

"You!" The Unranked man shouted. "What's your name? I always like to greet those I face in battle."

Vincent found this request strange… why would the Unranked be unaware of Quinn's name? At this point the whole world practically knew it, had he been living under a rock. Either way, Vincent replied.

"Quinn Talen, and yours?!" Vincent replied out of respect.

It was then that the man pulled down his hood, revealing his face…

"My name is Sera…"

Albad stood up in the glass container room to get a closer look at the match.

"There's another name that we have for him between us, Unranked… usually we just call him the 'God of War.' "
