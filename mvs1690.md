Chapter 1690: Get off!
Vorden, along with Hannah, had decided to head back to where the others were. Without the Dragon there, everything was possibly left to Jake and Vicky and the other two members of the Blade family who had come along with Vorden on the trip.

“Although I did that training with the dragon in the shadow space, I don’t think I’m ready to take on the world’s best.” Hannah thought as she made her way over, but they soon realised that perhaps Jake and Vicky didn’t need so much of their help.

Before, many members of the Chained were worried about getting involved in the fight due to the Dragon, but now, with the Dragon gone, they could take part in the fight. However, within the next few moments, several mounds of what looked like heavy mud crushed many of the members.

As for the person responsible for this, it was Vicky. Using the demon tier beast weapon at her disposal, she ensured the others wouldn’t get involved. Then there was Jake, along with the other two blades, who had done well to hold off the other attackers.

Just as they arrived, General Fizwell looked to have recovered and was going in for a hit, but before he could even get close to Jake, the latter stomped his foot, and a metallic mound lifted from the ground. Fizwell’s punch had successfully hit but did next to nothing.

“Am I doing the right thing?” Fizwell thought.

‘I’m kinda pissed at the Dragon that effortlessly defeated me, but I can’t just attack the Green family. Andy will bite off my arse if I continue.”

Jake knew this well that Fizzwell was putting up a show which was helping him take out the others, including the real problematic one, the dhampir. It was almost as if she had gone up a second gear.

No matter what Jake tried to do, he couldn’t reach and attack her. He struck out a quick lighting strike towards Flora after blocking another attack from Fizzwell.

However, she had readied her sword and swung it in a lower semi-circle arc. Hitting it at the right moment, it looked as if she had wrapped the lighting around her sword.

Then, throwing out a strike of her, the lightning strike went back towards Jake but was quickly stopped by another metallic mound he had created.

“Her swordsmanship is troublesome against lightning attacks. But, at least I’m learning something. Jake thought.

“The dhampirs have always been good with the sword. Are they preparing something special against the Graylash family? Are they expecting to clash with them as well? Either way, I might have to select a different set of powers against them.”

“Hey, it looks like you could use a hand,” Vorden said as he walked forward, he had reached this group of four, “Look, this fight is useless.”

It was then that Vorden pointed towards Fizzle, who was now captured. She looked extremely guilty with her head down towards the ground and still had a few wounds on her body from the fight against Mitchell.

“If you know we captured her, you should know that we dealt with the rest, and unfortunately, the rest weren’t as lucky as her.”

It didn’t take long for the expression of the members of the Chained stuck in the mounds to turn pale.

Nevertheless, the fact that he had come back with one of the core members of the primary Chained team meant something, and the reporters who had been hiding at the back also had to pinch themselves to believe what was happening.

“Does this mean that the Blades… defeated the Chained? Their long dispute is over?” A reporter asked.

“That can’t be right; they just have one; maybe it’s a transformation skill or something?” Another replied. “They just want to stop the fighting”

The reporters didn’t believe Vorden’s words and hearing them, those in the Chained weren’t inclined to believe it so much either. They just couldn’t. Did it mean their leader Russ had died as well? And where were these others that had defeated them?

“It’s true.” A voice came through from the crowd.

“The ‘A team’ as you guys refer to them, were completely defeated.” When looking at who was speaking, they saw that it was the famous reporter Aj.

“I filmed everything. I filmed them getting beat by the intruders, I saw it with my own eyes, and all of you will be able to witness it as well.”

Hearing this was a big blow to the Chained. They all knew how strong this A team was, but there was still one question on their mind.

“What about that Vampire…and Russ, are they…” The reporters and many questions to ask, but Aj simply shook his head, indicating he didn’t have an answer for them.

“I don’t know where the two are. I can’t find them… but everything else is true. I think before all the major factions leaders fight, you need to consider why you are fighting.”

“There may be no reason for you to fight anymore.” Aj said.

He, too, wanted the fighting to stop. Although he was a reporter, he felt like, based on what he had seen… that they were perhaps fighting on the wrong side because there was one thing that Aj had captured, and he had figured it out.

It sounded like Clicker had transported the main intruder out of the fight, which meant he had to have known his name. If that was the case, then who was the intruder?

Something was playing at the back of his mind: a video he witnessed his family line make many times. But if he were to report this, he felt like the world would think he was crazy.

As a reporter, it was his duty to verify facts from alleged possibilities. “Everything that the reporter said is true,” Vorden said, stepping forward. “We just want the girl named Jessica, and everyone will leave.”

“We can talk about things properly another time, but there is another problem. Everyone needs to leave this place… something is happening, a fight that could destroy this island.” Now the others were even more perplexed.

“Yeah… right.” Flora laughed. “You think we would believe that. You use an excuse like that to stop this fight.”

Vorden shook his head.

“Look, I just care about my own life and those I need to look after. That’s why I’m trying to stop this fight, and if you don’t listen, I will do it by force. But let me tell you, I won’t be the one dealing with you. It will be someone else.”

Vorden pointed to his head when he said that, and many didn’t understand what the Blaide was trying to convey, but Vicky looked over and shook her head. She knew this wasn’t a good idea but chose to remain silent.

The situation was now at a stalemate. The reporters, Chained, and allies were deciding what to do and what would be the best decision to make.

“I came here with those from Pure, and they told us to help the chained, so I will continue to do that,” Flora stated, pointing her weapon towards Vorden.

Just as a few others were about to make their decision, a flash of bright light could be seen on their faces. Quickly all eyes turned to their right, and all they could see was a giant cloud off in the distance, having erupted high in the air.

Less than a second later, the ground started to shake, everyone could feel the surface beneath their feet rumbling, and it was getting wilder with every passing moment. Then, before anyone could react, they heard a loud bang – the sound of the explosion had reached them.

“Everyone! Get behind me!” Jake shouted as he jumped to the side of everyone.

He placed both hands on the ground and created the largest mound he could. Then, combining his hardening powers, he tried to harden them as much as possible.

Seeing how dangerous the situation was, Vicky also used her demon tier weapon to try to reinforce the wall with the mud. Everyone wondered what was happening, but they heard another loud bang, and they all could feel as if something had hit the wall.

“What is this, vorden…? This is just the first wave; the real explosion hasn’t even arrived and…I don’t even know if this wall can hold!” Jake shouted.

“It’s… what I was talking about. We all need to get off this island.” Vorden replied while gritting his teeth.

***

Chapter 1691: Shockwave
Everyone could feel an intense amount of energy bombarding on the wall created by Jake. It was so much that they could even feel the heat produced from the attack. The scary part was how far away the explosion had occurred, meaning this was just the first wave of the attack; the real blow was yet to reach them.

“Hey, guys, I don’t think it will hold up so much… we need a plan B!” Jake gritted his teeth, barely holding on against the incoming energy onslaught.

A few cracks could be seen breaking through the metal indenting inward. Now noticing that the wall wouldn’t hold for long, the reporters and members of the Chained ran back towards the main establishment. The docking bay where all their ships were stationed was on the other side, but they didn’t think they could make it in time.

Seeing that Jake was struggling, Vicky retracted the mud holding up the wall for support. She then formed two daggers in her hand and stabbed them towards the floor, and soon, everyone at the scene was covered in an igloo-like mud bowl.

As soon as Jake’s vision was blocked, the wall crumbled. Next, the wave of energy hit the mud, and everyone inside could feel the ground shaking again. Finally, they could hear the sound of heavy things falling over, and eventually, it stopped.

The time had passed.

“Is everyone okay?” Vicky asked and noticed a few people she hadn’t exactly planned to save eve n though they were here. The Bree leader and her beast had run into the large encased mudball. Even Flora had somehow made her way in, much to Vicky’s disappointment.

The rest were the allies that Vicky had tried to protect, and surprisingly, Aj was also there; he had run into the circle at the last moment

Regardless, Vicky couldn’t complain about who had used her shield and decided to disintegrate the mud wall, revealing the scene on the side, the destruction caused by this wave of energy. In front of them, the ground appeared to be scorched. It had changed from the dry mud ground to being burned black.

Then, when they turned around, the whole Chained establishment that once stood tall was now almost non-existent. The building had collapsed and crumbled, and it certainly didn’t resemble a wedding venue, even the blood-red roses were now nothing but ashes.

Soon, they also noticed a few who seemed to have survived the attack-coming out from the wreckage of the building. Most of them had used their powers in some way to protect their lives, but not everyone was lucky enough to survive.

A few were also trying to heal others, but there was also a look of panic on their face because everyone could hear and feel constant vibrations ringing through the air, and one after another, loud bangs could be heard off in the distance.

There was no incoming shockwave like the one before, but now everyone was frightened that soon there could be another.

“What was that? You have to explain!” Fizzwell asked.

Vorden looked off in the distance from where the energy vibrations were coming from.

“I think that was the warning he was talking about. Now we don’t have much time.”

Saying these words, Vorden could already see people heading straight for where the ships were. They needed to leave this place right now, but it looked like one of the spaceships was no longer in operation, having been damaged in the shockwave.

“Everyone, head back and get out of here!” Vorden ordered. “Tommy, Way, you will come with me and head to the Blade ship. We have to stop anyone taking the ship at all costs.”

“What do you mean?” Jake asked. “Aren’t you going to be leaving as well? So why are you protecting the ship.”

As the words left his mouth, Jack realised that everything his uncle had been doing was for a reason, and it had to be a big one to go so far for someone.

“We will be staying here until the last possible second. Don’t worry about us. We were never involved much in your political sphere in the first place. Just leave and get to safety. I’ll see you again.”

The others had already left, deciding it was too dangerous, leaving only Vicky and Jake out of the great allies. It looked like Jake wanted to stay, but Vicky had decided for him as she began to pull his arm.

“When you see him, tell him I said hi,” Vicky shouted toward Vorden. “If he survives this, I certainly will see him again and make sure he comes to us. He’s been waiting for him for a long time as well!”

*** *** ***

In the underground floor of the Chained establishment. They had created a special place, and this place was specifically made for Jessica. They thought she might attempt to escape once again. Thus, they have currently put her in this special room made of Glatharium bars.

The bars were too strong for her to break on her own, and there was a weird circular lock combination on the door. This was where she had been the whole time after Clicker had teleported her.

The underground room was occasionally shaking due to the events on the surface, and even parts of the ceiling seemed to fall, worrying Jessica that she might die a horrible death, either being suffocated or getting crushed. However, she wasn’t alone.

“Please!” Jessica shouted. “Can’t you see that something is going on out there? They don’t care about you or me. They might have even forgotten about us! Do you really want to die down here?”

The hooded figure that was present in the special room with her hadn’t said a word. Instead, she was just tossing a coin the whole time.

“You’re a vampire, right!” Jessica shouted. “Why are you even working for the Chained? That makes no sense!”

“I choose my battles.” The hooded figure finally replied, and to Jessica’s surprise, it was a female voice. “I have lived this long because of how I have acted and who I have chosen to go with. However, I don’t just care for my life anymore.”

“Waking up from my slumber and witnessing all of that. I now wish to know and destroy the culprits… who are behind the destruction of the vampire settlement.” She said, gripping the coin tightly in her hand. “This is one step, and many more are to come.”

When she tossed the coin once more, it landed on the heads facing up. She turned around and pulled her hood down, revealing the most stunning perfect face Jessica had ever seen. She was so taken aback by the beauty that she even took a step back and turned slightly away as if she wasn’t allowed to look at such a person.

While looking away, Jessica soon heard a click, and that’s when she saw the door to her cell door had opened.

“Now is the time for us to leave.” The female vampire said.

*** *** ***

Flying through the air, Quinn was trying to see if he could spot the others somehow. He was up high after all and continued to head towards the noise, but he soon could hear another noise coming in another direction, and that’s when he too saw the large explosion.

“Master Quinn!”

Upon lowering his gaze, Quinn happened to see Mitchell. The latter was running around like a headless chicken looking for Quinn, and he had finally found him, but there looked to be trouble as Quinn could sense the large energy coming towards them.

Quickly, he dashed towards Mitchell. Quinn had to decide whether to try to attack the energy to create an opening or try something else, but at that moment, he could also feel that his shadow had returned. Using the demon tier’s active ability, Quinn instantly used the shadow on his wings and enveloped himself and Mitchell.

The blast hit them, and they were unaffected. After things settled down a bit and the energy blast went by, Quinn spread out his wings again.

“What… was that?” Quinn wondered.

“Thank you! Thank you, master, thank you for saving me!” Mitchell shouted. “There is a lot I need to tell you… and yeah, I might have an idea what that explosion was.”

Mitchell swiftly recounted the summary of whatever happened while the former was away. Upon hearing the details of what had happened so far, Quinn came to know that the explosion had come from Ray, but now there were two questions on his mind: Who was Ray fighting against? And did he need to go and help Ray?

***

​Chapter 1692: Catching up!
The shockwave had destroyed most of the Chained establishment, but the other half of it was still standing and mostly relatively intact. There weren't any vampires at all in the Chained establishment other than Jessica, so at the moment, the group was running around hoping that Minny's nose was able to catch something.

After running through the rubble and finding nothing, they decided to head into this part of the establishment which mainly was undamaged. They ran through the marble floor, looking into the empty rooms and places, and eventually ran to where the living quarters of the Chained were.

Due to their fast speed, they had managed to get past a few of the Chained who were still in the middle of escaping.

They arrived in a large hallway decorated in red and gold. However, the building was clearly not what it used to be with most of the ceiling cracked due to the force from the shockwave.

"They might know a few answers?" Peter asked as he placed Lucia, who was riding on his back this whole way, back on the floor.

Her face was a little embarrassed because the truth was her lighting abilities had already come back, and she could have kept up with the group on foot, but it was too late as Peter had already picked her up before she could say anything.

It was then that those of the Chained turned around and also noticed them.

"Hey... I think I saw some of those guys fighting against Clicker and the others."

"Come on, let's just ignore them and get out of here." Another one commented.

Look, do you think we will be able to just leave this place? The enemies might attack as soon as we step out, but if we take one of them with us as a hostage, we will have a better chance of escaping.

Some of the members of their group seemed to agree with this. Soon, six of them turned around, facing Peter and his group.

"Well, it looks like we don't need to stop them after all," Peter said, and in the next second, a fluorescent glowing substance came out straight towards Lucia. The latter was ready to use her lighting abilities and defend herself, but before it even reached her. Peter stepped forward and placed his hand out, blocking the attack.

The glowing substance turned out to be some strange acid as it melted Peter's hand upon contact. However, as the latter's hand fell off, it regenerated itself, quick enough for him to use the same hand to punch the attacker right in his face and send him flying through the walls.

"Where is Jessica?" Peter asked, turning around. "Or do you all want to be beaten to your last breath?"

The Chained were stunned to move and too afraid that they would pay for the consequences if they did. They couldn't clearly see Peter's movements, but they could easily see the hole that their fellow member created in the wall after getting hit by Peter's punch.

"Peter... he didn't hesitate to protect me again. I know he's strong and has good regenerative abilities, but to not hesitate at all? That was quite reckless; who knows what abilities these people have."

"Uncle is so cool," Minny said, pumping her fist.

Remembering that Minny was on her back, she thought that perhaps Peter wasn't doing it for her but was doing it because of both of them. After all, he stated he would always do whatever Quinn told him to do.

However, turning around, rather than capturing the others, Peter walked up to Lucia.

"Are you alright? You didn't get hit by any of that acid stuff, did you? It's quite strong."

Lucia nodded, confirming she was okay without saying a word, and the next second, Peter had grabbed someone by the ruff of their neck and held him in the air.

"Minny, use your influence skill," Peter asked. "And if this person tries to block your questions with his Qi, I'll slowly start squeezing his head until it explodes," Staring at the terrified man in his grasp, he added.

"Trust me, this is not a threat, but something I can easily do."

The man was almost shedding a tear due to his situation, but he was also the one that had come up with the idea of attacking them.

"There's no need!" A voice shouted down the hallway.

Turning away, as they saw who was the one speaking, Lucia and Minny were shocked for a moment but then swiftly recollected themselves and ran towards the person incoming.

"Jessica, finally! Are you alright? Where were you?" They shouted.

But they suddenly paused when noticing Jessica wasn't on her own, and another female was standing next to her.

She stood so close that Lucia and Minny didn't think of her as an enemy. Regardless, Peter was so stunned by seeing this person that he had let go of the Chained in his hand.

"How... how are you still here, and why do you look so young? Why are you even here?" Peter asked, ready for another battle. He hadn't seen this person much, it was only a couple of times, but Peter remembered the vampire leaders well,

"It's a long story" Muka replied.

"But I think we should save the stories for later his whole place won't last for long. There are strong shockwaves of energy hitting this building every second and I don't think it can take much more. But for a quick answer you can say I'm one of the lucky ones."

They didn't argue with her response as the building shook, and parts of the ceiling were now falling. The group decided it was time to leave, especially since they had achieved what they had planned to do. Still, Peter's mind was occupied on how Muka managed to live so long and still look somewhat the same.

Muka was a vampire that had already lived quite a long time, and then there was Fex as well. How come she didn't turn old like Fex? Things just weren't fair, something wasn't right for things to be this way while so much time had passed, and Peter knew Quinn would surely look for the answers.

It didn't take long for the whole group to reach the area where all the ships were docked. Ships were currently taking off and leaving the island, flying into the air. They weren't leaving the earth's atmosphere but flying to other areas.

However, there was one Spaceship where they could see Hannah and a middle-aged black-haired man and the other Blades that had arrived with them. There also looked to be a few knocked out people near the ship as well.

As expected, some had tried to steal the ship because the shockwave had destroyed most of the ships, and only a few ships could take off. But, of course, there weren't many who could take on the Blade Family.

'Well, it looks like everything worked out well. Hannah smiled while thinking, "They really came in and saved the princess in the middle of all these people, but the real question is, where is the hero?"

"Where is Quinn?" Vorden asked.

"We didn't see him around; he must be out there somewhere, Mitchell is looking for him as well." Lucia replied. Now, the others needed to decide what to do.

"Quinn... are you talking about the old king?!" Muka asked, completely stunned her hand covered her open mouth, and her eyeballs nearly popped out from the shock.

"We will wait for some time," Vorden said.

"We can wait, and even if we board the ship, we will search for the two. Knowing him, he might have even decided to go and search for what is causing this mess. He might even still be fighting out there."

The others who knew Quinn were inclined to agree. That was when Minny sensed something and quickly hopped off Lucia's shoulder. In the next moment, rising through the shadow, they could see the one and only Quinn.

Quinn raised his hand upon stepping out, and suddenly, Mitchell appeared out of a shadow.

"I'm here," Quinn said, looking at everyone around him. He was happy to see Jessica and the others all there okay, but after a moment, he couldn't help but raise his eyebrows, especially towards Muka.

"We will catch up later, let's get out of here first." Vorden smiled.

***

​Chapter 1693: Teacher...
When arriving, there were a few extra faces that Quinn could see that he didn't quite recognise, but the fact that they weren't outright fighting each other, Quinn had quickly accepted them as allies.

There were a lot of questions on his mind, especially since he could see Muka there, but it looked like everyone was in a tricky situation and already was following the middle-aged black-haired man into the spaceship.

That's definitely Muka, without a doubt. If one of the vampire leaders is alive, then maybe I can ask her some questions about what happened to the others. I wanted to ask Fex, but it was best to keep his time short. Besides, it seemed like he went down another path away from them. Quinn thought.

Once everyone was on board, it was time for the ship to start and head off. While waiting for this, quite a few people couldn't wait to talk to Quinn, and their eyes hadn't left him.

"Quinn!" Muka, Jessica, and Vorden all said at the same time. Immediately, they looked at each other, and there seemed to be a few sparks in the air.

"I have been waiting to see his majesty for so long. I thought he would never come back, now is my chance to talk to him. What could these two possibly say that would be of importance?" Muka thought.

"I have to thank him... I have to thank Quinn... I didn't even know who he was. Is this all real?"

"I still can't believe it, but while in that cell, I thought if I ever get to see him another day, I have to tell Quinn. I have to tell him how much he changed my life." Jessica thought.

While the two girls were thinking this, they could see the middle-aged dark-haired man continue to walk forward towards Quinn and immediately go to embrace him with a hug.

Being a little on guard lately, due to the new people he was constantly meeting and somewhat had been hostile towards him, Quinn took a step back, avoiding the hug.

"Ah, I'm so sorry, Quinn." The man bowed down on the ground with his head down.

"Quinn. I was just so happy to see you, and I never thought I would get this chance again. Teacher... Teacher, it's been so long... You changed my life, and I was trying to find you... I knew you would still be alive..that's why... that's why-"

It was a strange sight for everyone to see, this middle-aged man was suddenly breaking down in tears like a child and his voice changed, making him seem like a completely different person.

Still, Quinn was unable to recognise them. Eventually, they looked at Quinn, wiping their tears away on their sleeve.

"Sorry, of course, you won't recognise me, this body is old, and it's not even mine in the first place. It's Shiro."

"You might not even remember much, but I was a pupil of yours. We went into Owen's mind together and..."

Before Shiro could finish his sentence, Quinn had hugged him tightly.

"I'm sorry, I'm sorry I didn't recognise you. Of course, I remembered you, Shiro. You did so much for us back then, even though you were just a child, even younger than I was, and I can't imagine how much you have been through."

"There has to be a reason why your mind is still conscious in another body after all of these years. You probably thought you needed to do more... I'm so sorry you couldn't just live a peaceful life."

Hearing all of these words, Shiro's tears kept on falling on the back of Quinn's clothes. He wanted to say so much, and he had always kept up a brave face being a part of the Blade family, but he didn't even know where to start.

Pushing Quinn away, Shiro wiped his tears once again. "It's not fair for me... it's not fair that I'm the only one that gets to enjoy your return, Quinn."

"There is someone else, someone else that has been waiting for you to come back just as long as I have."

Shiro closed his eyes, and when opening them again, the air around him had changed once more.

"Damn." Were the first words out of his mouth.

"I don't know anyone who could cause as much of a large mess as you. It makes sense, though. You never took no for an answer, not even on Blade island. Otherwise, I wouldn't be here today."

Just by the way he had spoken, even though the sound of the voice wasn't the same. Quinn had grasped who it was instantly. A lump was felt in his throat.

It felt like he wanted to cry, he wanted to show emotions and knew what this feeling was, having felt it before, but it was almost as if his body wasn't letting him, so instead, he smiled and went in for another hug.

"Hey, hey!" Vorden said. "You do know who this is, right? I'm not Layla."

"Of course, I know who you are," Quinn said, pulling away.

"Vorden, I'm glad you are here. I'm happy that there are still people that I know. Honestly... when I received this chest piece, I thought you might have been dead..."

During Quinn's little talk, the sound of Muka clearing her throat was heard. There was a lot that she wanted to say as well. Quinn realised it wasn't the time to speak, and the ship was already airborne ready to leave.

Before it did, the ship was shaking a few times due to the energy in the distance. Looking out of the glass, one could see small specks of explosions that were actually quite large and only looked small due to the distance.

"I know a lot of you want to speak to me. I want to speak to you all as well, but there is something I need to do before we leave this place."

"Can you head towards where those explosions are going? Don't get too close, and don't worry, I can protect us!" Quinn said.

Some thought he was crazy, even Jessica, who didn't quite know what was happening; for one, everyone who was meant to be here was already here, but Vorden didn't hesitate as he went to the controls and started pushing forward.

"Don't worry. I won't get you guys involved in this. Just take me close enough to see what's happening, and then we can decide what to do." Quinn said as he walked over to the side of the ship where the door could be opened.

Quinn had decided to come back to the ship because he believed that Ray was alright. There was proof in that by the fact the fighting was still going on. On top of that, he had promised to get Jessica and was unsure if there would be more troubles on the way.

In the fight with Russ, something still felt off, and there was the celestial he was worried about. The fact that a celestial or someone with celestial energy was with the Chained in the first place was worrying and strange.

"What are you planning to do," Vorden said, getting close to Quinn.

"The energy readings are strong... really strong, Quinn. I don't quite know what is going on out there myself. Maybe you know a little more, but Chris and that Dragon of yours that you summoned are the ones fighting."

"Chris! You mean Chris from Pure!" Quinn said, surprised.

Out of all the people to produce this much energy and last this long against someone as great as Ray, Quinn never expected it to be Chris, even with the increase of Qi energy he could feel.

Pressing a button by the side, the side wing of the spaceship started to open up, and at the same time, Quinn activated his demon tier chest piece.

"I have to stop this fighting before they destroy the planet that everyone has been trying so hard to save. Get out of here!"

Quinn shouted as he jumped out of the spaceship and started to fly off in the distance towards the fight.

***

​Chapter 1694: Two Titans
By now, everyone who wanted to leave had already left the Chained Island, and that included members of the Chained themselves. They once called this place their home but now had to decide. They had an ominous feeling that the Chained would no longer be the same powerhouse it was at the beginning of the day.

When the sun rose from the eastern horizon today, their faction was one of the world's most powerful factions, but now, just because of one intruder, they were nothing.

Some headed in the direction of the Dhampir ship, along with the Pure's members. In contrast, the rest had left with members of the Green family.

The waves of energy, happening off in the distance, were still shaking the land and destroying all that they had created.

The strong building of the Chained was now nothing but ruins. Even now, pieces of rubble would break further as more and more energy struck them.

Whatever was the cause of this, no one wanted any part in it. Not even the reporters that were dying for a news story, dying to tell the world why or how this had all occurred, had stayed. This included Aj, who was known as the most daring.

They did the right thing by leaving the place. The energy coming from the two blows was so strong that perhaps it would have ruptured the inside of normal human beings that would stand too close.

*** *** ***

Out in the vast expanse on the other side of the huge Chained island, the fighting between the two continued in a crater of a mile-long radius.

A large dark fist delivered right into Chris's gut, lifting him in the air, then spinning and using his tail, Ray attempted to slam him right on his head.

There had been many times during the fight when Ray had tried to cut him with his claws, but Chris was skilful with his Qi and blocked these fatal blows.

This was why Ray found the best way to have an advantage in the fight was by empowering his fists with as much energy as possible and trying to take him down like so.

Chris raised a hand, grabbing the tail, and his large nails dug through the dragon's tail's hard scales. Then, using his other hand, Chris lifted the humanoid dragon by the tail and started to slam him into the ground, to his left and then to the right.

Up to his elbow had been completely transformed, covered in a grey coloured fur. At the same time, the rest of his skin was still red, as if he was still activating the fourth stage of Qi.

Eventually though, Ray had lifted himself using the muscles in his tail and opened his mouth wide. Bright yellow energy left his mouth, hitting Chris in the chest. Immediately the latter let go as he covered his body with his arms and was being pushed across the surface.

The energy continued to push him further, and the wound on his hand deepened as blood trickled off his arms. Eventually, gathering his Qi in his hands, he swung his arms, disrupting the flow of energy from the strange blasts.

"What's wrong?" Chris said, reverting his face back to normal. It was a little elongated, and his teeth were larger, making it harder for him to speak.

"Why don't you do the same attack as last time? You almost killed me before with that attack, Or is it a one-time thing, and you can't do it again?"

A quick blast of energy left Ray's mouth again. It wasn't a constant stream like before but was large and round.

Seeing this, Chris threw out his hand simultaneously, hitting the energy away and flinging it into the air off in the distance and there, it eventually exploded. Even though it exploded in the distance, it shook the ground where they were standing.

"I have fought against Werewolves before," Ray commented.

"Your energy, even though you hardly tire, and you feel like you can fight on forever, you can't. Your energy is not unlimited. As for me, I could carry on doing this all day."

Readying up their fists, Ray and Chris went at it again as they kicked off the ground. It didn't seem like the battle would end soon because none could get a significant advantage over the other. The fact that Ray had something else on his mind also affected his fighting strategy.

"How long... how long until everyone gets off this place?"

As the two were about to collide, a figure came storming down, crashing into the ground between the two. Both Chris and Ray felt like they should pay no bother as they threw out their fist in full force.

Mid-air, as the two fists hit, they felt that they had stopped. It felt like an invisible force like a magnet was pulling them, but all they could see in front of them was a purple shadow.

“You two… what are you doing?... Are you trying to destroy the entire planet?!"

Seeing the shadow and sensing the familiar energy, they both dropped their hands. They knew straight away who this was that included Chris as well.

"Is it you... is it Quinn?" Chris was beyond surprised. The reason why he knew it was Quinn was due to the energy. Quinn wasn't using his celestial energy now; he was just using his normal Qi, with blood aura.

This feeling was something that Chris had experienced first-hand, and it was an energy that he would never forget, as it was from his one and only student.

At the same time, Quinn was quite surprised that his wings could block the attack. Seeing the destruction around, Quinn was sure that they would have disappeared entirely if he had just had his 10,000 or so MC points.

Only something like shadow overload would have been able to handle this. Yet, with the active skill of the demon tier chest piece, there was no need to. He would also go through his shadow in the past, but it seemed like with the Demon tier equipment, the Qi had no effect.

"Quinn, what are you doing? Are you here to help me or what?" Ray asked.

Turning to Chris, seeing as it seemed like he had been recognised, Quinn wondered if there was another way to resolve this.

"Although Chris is a member of Pure, he has never mistreated me. Leo told me that the two of them even fought against the Dalki together."

"Of course, a lot of time has passed since then, but it's still the same Chris, right?"

"Let me talk to him, Ray," Quinn asked, turning around.

Although Chris wasn't attacking, his arms were still transformed, ready to strike at any moment. And even if Quinn had blocked the attacks from the two, he was unsure if he could stop another at this distance.

One disadvantage he had was the movement of his wings to block the attack. In the first place, he didn't have the element of surprise now.

"What? Is he a friend of yours? You know him from back then, but he isn't a human anymore!" Ray said.

"It doesn't; look like he's human to me," Quinn replied, noticing that Chris looked like the other Pure member he had seen before. And, it was clear that the latter also had some Werewolf DNA in him.

"Let me give you a warning, Quinn, before you decide to talk to your old friend." Ray started to speak.

"For the others, there was a reason why they all lived their time. I don't know what it was exactly or how they did it, but this person in front of you is different."

"If you look closely, even now, all the Qi in his body isn't quite his. If you put two and two together, there is only one way a human could have lived for so long."

"Quinn, he stole other people's lives!"

Quinn had heard Chris's heartbeat become slightly faster for a moment. It was a sign that there was some truth to these words. But Quinn wasn't much worried about this. Instead, putting his hand out towards Ray, he opened his palm.

"Ray, just rest for a few seconds."

A shadow appeared behind Ray, and the next second he had disappeared.

Chapter 1695: A good guy?
When Quinn had landed in the middle of the two titans fighting against each other. Something echoed in his ears after a long time:

Ding!

And a pop-up window appeared the next moment.

[New Quest received]

[An ancient enemy of the vampires is in front of you]

[Defeat the God Slayer]

When the system message had first appeared, Quinn believed that it was the same as he had received when fighting another member of Pure on Mars.

He could tell from seeing Graham's arms that they both had similar traits, although the colour of the fur on Chris was different.

However, seeing the name it had given the person in front of him, using the word 'God Slayer,' Quinn had no idea what this meant, and it was the first time such a term was used.

This proves it; the Pure has somehow managed to get their hands on Werewolf DNA and can fuse it It was almost as if there was a boost in energy with Quinn right after his transformation due to all of these things.

It was clear that this was coming from Ray, who had been polite enough to let Quinn have a normal conversation with Chris, but Quinn was holding out all this time because noticed that mentioning Leo's had caused Chris's heart to skip a beat once again.

There was something there, something between that Chris hasn't yet revealed.

"You really think I'm a good person Quinn?" Chris asked.

"Then would such a good person do nothing but stand and watch when Leo died?"

"What?... Leo's... dead?"

***

​Chapter 1696: Beyond Demon
A chaotic mess was going through Quinn's mind right now. When waking up, he felt like he was building a jigsaw getting one piece at a time. As he got more pieces of what had happened, he started to see the whole picture a little more, and he could guess what had happened here or there.

Which was why, when he knew next to nothing, seeing something that reminded him of Vorden caused him to act a certain way. However, despite all the puzzle pieces, one thing he couldn't see was this.

This was a corner piece from the puzzle he hadn't started to gather yet, and it had come crashing into the work, nearly throwing all the pieces out of order.

It was why he couldn't speak or say anything, there were just too many questions going through his mind.

"What is Chris saying? Leo is dead. Was he killed, or did he just die of old age? If it's true that Chris was there, then he couldn't have just died." Quinn thought.

He then remembered a crucial detail. While many of the Cursed faction had so far seemed to have lived long lives, maybe that wasn't the same for Leo.

After all, he had his own important mission to solve while he was getting rid of Graham, and that was stopping Pure from taking over Earth.

In a way, they had failed that task since Pure had become a mighty force that the people greatly supported today, unlike during Quinn's time.

"Who killed him, Chris?" Quinn asked, his eyes glowing red and the red aura energy bursting around his body.

"I don't think you meant to use the influence skill on me. I think you are consumed by rage at this moment," Chris replied.

"It's better this way, better that you're angry at me. Maybe then you can fight me without holding back."

The ground started to rumble once again, and a loud bang followed shortly after, following even more explosions and sounds of destruction. The two looked at each other, thinking it was one of them but soon realised that it wasn't.

Deep in thought and focused so much on what had happened in front of them, they hadn't had time to see what the scenery was around them. The land, Earth, was acting strange,

Tornadoes had created large vortexes that went up to dark clouds that were firing out lighting. Striking the ground constantly.

A pressure of heat had shot up from one part of the land, while steam from another along with trickles of water. It looked like the earth was crying, in pain from the fight that had occurred. Looking at the area around them, Quinn felt a little guilty.

"I know you won't tell me more, but I will have the answers the next time we meet," Quinn stated.

"Don't tell me! Quinn, wait!" Chris shouted, but it was too late. Quinn had become a shadow and had started sinking away. A few moments later, and when Quinn could see once again, he was inside the metallic hull of the spaceship, with all the others looking at him.

"We're happy to see you're not hurt," Peter said.

However, although Quinn wasn't physically hurt on the outside, there was pain somewhere else. He needed a rest from this all. Because he was hurt on say much, and they knew they needed to give him space.

Quickly finding the sleeping area on the ship, Quinn laid down looking at the bunk bed above, thinking about what he had heard.

"Leo, you were the teacher that helped us out so much at the academy, and even when I turned you and got you involved in all of this mess, you never once got angry at me."

"Why is it that everyone that decides to get involved with me dies... should I have gone back and stayed with him then?"

There was more than just one moment where Leo had helped him, becoming his vampire knight, helping out Erin several times, with reasonability that should have been Quinn's. Helping out with the Cursed faction, and he was his teacher in many things in life.

There were ways that no matter how strong Quinn had gotten, he thought he could never best Leo, and in a way, he was excited to see.

If Leo had managed to survive a 1000 years, just how much further someone like him would have been able to hone their skills.

"He always had time to help me with my troubles, but I never got the chance to help him out with any of his. The least I could do..is complete his goal and find out what happened to him." Quinn thought.

"Have you spent enough time mulling over someone who might have already been dead for a 1000 years?" Ray commented.

"Just because you have come to this realisation or found out this piece of information, you can't change anything, but what is important is to talk about what happened back there."

Ray was quite blunt with his words, but Quinn knew he talked some sense, and after helping him out significantly today, he was inclined to listen.

"You should listen up carefully to what I have to say. That guy's power was dangerous; he had power beyond that of a Demon tier beast."

"The only person, or a Dragon, I should say, that had that kind of power was Krad, and he is the one that had your shadow powers, to begin with."

"Huh, wait, my powers, you knew the person who had the powers before me?" Quinn was a little surprised.

"Look, just ignore that part for now." Ray interrupted.

"What I'm saying is that guy is a threat, a threat that can match you. After 1000 years, you have managed to run into one of these guys, but what if there's more?"

"During my time, Bliss always talked about these scary things, how too much power in one solar system or area would attract too much attention."

"I didn't really understand it, and I don't really understand it now, but what I do know is they're more of those out there that are like that."

In the past, I gave up my life because I believed that the earth didn't need anyone to protect it anymore, but it's clear that it's not like that anymore.

I feel like soon; there might be a battle of the gods or something similar. If that's the case, you're going to need more than just your strength.

"When fighting, I realised something. You guys might think this body is strong, but it's weak. It can't use my full strength, especially after the new power I got."

"I didn't come out and show that Werewolf guy a lesson because I realised that when I went back into the shadow space. The body was in pain."

"If I tried to do another large scale attack, I don't know what would have happened. Anyway, my point is... I'll be leaving you, Quinn."

"I'm leaving in order to increase my powers, and I'll come back when you need me."

A lot of information was being thrown at him, but Quinn had the obvious question he wanted to ask.

"Wait... I mean. I guess I'm fine with you leaving. I don't think there's anyone that can really get to you, but where would you even go and do what? You said to get your body stronger, but how?" Quinn asked.

"I have a few ways." Ray replied.

"There's the person that had placed me in the tablet in the first place. Right now, we don't; know where the tablet is but maybe there's is something that can be done there."

"It means tracking down that woman, then I don't want to involve you in her crap. If that doesn't work, then I'll just have to search for some demon tier beasts or Nest crystal and consume them."

"Maybe this body of this Dragon's will get strong enough to contain the energy then."

"Wait, consume Demon tier and Nest crystals? More than one? You mean, there's a tier above the Demon tier?" Quinn asked.

Demon tier beasts were already a frightening existence. The strongest being the Dragon that caused all of this mess in the first place.

"I don't know about that. I just know that I was stronger than this dragon, and I had consumed a nest crystal before. Maybe it would help you out if you got a few as well." Ray replied.

*** *** ***

After a short back and forth, there wasn't really much Quinn could do. Heading to the back of the ship, he had agreed to let Ray free to do his thing. Ray had made it clear that he wasn't requesting but telling Quinn what he was going to do, which was why there wasn't much arguing over it in the first place.

After opening up the back, Ray was seen in his humanoid dragon form, summoning wings and flying off in the distance to do his thing. When he would be back, Quinn didn't know, and for a second he wondered if he had made a mistake if this would be another loss, but he realised that there was no stopping someone like that.

Turning around, Quinn looked back at the rest of the ship.

"Right... this is the Blade's ship, and Vorden is back as well. It's time I focus on the things that I need to do and find out what happened."

Chapter 1697: Crazy Blood-Lord!
Although the world wasn't under a significant threat like it was before, the current options of the public were split in two, and they were almost fifty-fifty in terms of popularity among the people's views.

Politics was something the people could no longer ignore. It was one of the many reasons everyone's eyes were on the Chained's event that was being broadcasted over all forms of media, and the whole world had turned up to see the grand wedding.

Even though the live broadcast had ended, the occasion was still a hot topic throughout the world, and people were discussing the shocking turn of events they had witnessed today.

Many questions, speculations, rumours, and conspiracy theories were spreading across the internet.

The most common were regarding questions such as:

"Have the Dalki returned? What was the identity of the person who had crashed into the wedding?"

"Were the Chained no longer a faction if they were, which side had they chosen to align with?"

"What will be the reaction of the other factions? How will world politics change now in the upcoming days?"

The people's primary focus was on the Dragon, who had turned into a humanoid. There was a lot of conversation and segments between hosts talking about this.

"Hey, do you think that was the original Dalki or something, like the person who created them all?"

"It's him. He and his group took everything away from me. No matter what appearance he has, I can tell by his actions that it's him, Quinn Talen."

"It looks like me, and you have the same thought. I never thought out of all the people in the world that the two of us would be standing next to each other after what happened." The man replied.

"Yet here we are. Still, we have to be patient, very patient. I have spent all this time making sure things won't go wrong, and that brat took all the pleasures from me."

"But worry not, we will take the stage by storm when the time is right."

The man said, walking away into the darkness once again.

Chapter 1698: Woken Up
The crew knew something was going on with Quinn because he had requested access to open up the back of the ship. No one knew why, nor did they ask questions. Things just naturally fell in place for them, all now knowing who he was.

Those that were his friends trusted him, while others knew him as a legend, which they still hadn't entirely processed the fact he was here through their heads.

When returning, he had done so in an assertive mood, Pulling up a seat, Quinn sat down at the meeting table, and straight away, all of the others gathered around, apart from the other two Blade members who were controlling the ship, continuing to fly to their destination.

"I know many of you have questions you want to ask, and it's the same for me. So first. I will tell you everything that I know, and then we can try to fill in the spots from there."

Before Quinn went on to explain to everyone. Vorden had updated him on the videos that had been shown of him online, as well as updating him on what the public opinion of him was. Quinn found it all interesting, to say the least.

He also thought the name chosen was quite silly. However, it was just one of the many different things he had been called throughout his life that he could add to that list.

After that, it was Quinn's turn to talk. He informed everyone there about his situation, Lucia, Hannah, Jessica Vorden and Muka, who didn't know the full extent of his past.

Explaining what he could remember after defeating Graham and what had occurred when he woke up.

It came as quite a surprise to many of them, but what came as more of a surprise was perhaps that no one knew anything.

Quinn sat there asking if Muka or Vorden knew anything to do with why he was in that apartment with Peter or who could have possibly moved them.

"With that video, I think you might start to see more people coming to look for you now than you thought."

Finishing that, Vorden stood up and looked behind him. He could see something through the glass that had put a smile on his face.

After that, he stepped to the side, allowing Quinn to see, and what he could see was a city that had been built up from the sea. A large city that wasn't on any land but was similar to that of a small country.

"One of those people has already contacted me. There's more than one person that wants to speak to you, and I think it would be best if we both spoke to you together anyway."

"We're finally here. We are here to meet Logan Green. I hope with both of us we can fill you in on everything that happened in the last 1000 years." Vorden stated.

***

Chapter 1699: Meeting Place
When the video broadcast of the Chained event was being shown live, one person glued his eyes onto the screen, not just to one specific screen but multiple. Watching them all at the same time, trying to make sure they didn't miss a single second.

Because when they saw Quinn enter the main stage disrupting the big wedding, their heart started to race, and sweat was pouring down from both sides of his head.

"Is that..." With Quinn's next move, as he summoned the dragon from the shadow, it had confirmed all of Logan's suspicions.

He was watching the clip multiple times as he looked at a person he hadn't met in so long. At the time, Logan had tried to contact his son.

However, the Chained had somehow blocked all forms of communication apart from the live streams. Logan could only assume that it was one of the abilities, but by the time he saw that Shiro had decided to help out anyway, Logan knew they were in good hands.

"I can't believe it, I thought it might have been them, but I also thought I was being tricked. However, he had the Dragon with him; it had to be him."

"This can't be some sort of trick. Quinn has really returned." Logan said, all excited as he continued to type away in his large lab.

He was looking through files, and the videos, bringing up past dates and trying to figure out a pattern. In the end, Logan could assume when it had started and tried to follow all of the events, eventually heading back to when the Dhampirs had first attacked one of the testing planets on a Graylash planet.

"Here... here is the moment they were last seen. But why were the Dhampirs there? Was it a coincidence, or perhaps they somehow knew Quinn was going to be there before even us... but how is that possible?"

"It couldn't have been Pure, they worked closely with us and if they had such a strong ally to help them, they would never have partnered with us to try and find the red heart."

"I smile every time I see it. I can't get over it." Peter said.

"So he wants to meet us here?" Quinn guessed, ignoring the more than life-size statue of him.Shiro shook his head and pointed out the direction of the large building behind the statue.

"Not here, but there."

Looking closely, the others read the words on the building.

[Earth's national museum of the Great Hero Quinn Talen.]
