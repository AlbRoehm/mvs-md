# Chapter 1340 - A Large List…
Things still had yet to go back to normal in the vampire settlement, but it had been days since the attack had last occurred. The pooling area was now non-existent. The vampires that were still alive had finally been given access to the inner castle areas.

A decision that had taken longer than it should and had left a bad taste in their mouths with their leaders. The pooling area vampires were vampires that often switched between families. When they next got the chance, they felt they would in the future move to the families that had acted quicker and were more successful in defending their people.

It was because of this that the middle of the settlement had become a ghost town. Abandoned and destroyed houses from the last fight, having yet to be repaired. Blood left staining the street floors, and a pile of bodies gathered, ready to be burnt.

The tenth family, once again, had taken in the most refugees. A lot of the vampires from the pooling area were insistent on going there after seeing and hearing how well they had done to defend themselves from the attack. It was a similar situation in the thirteenth family. Still, for some reason, they had decided to take no one outside of their own family.

However, despite all this, all of the castles, the leaders, and people were on the tip of their toes, for one of the royal knights and leaders had been killed and in their own castle. If they could get to them, who was to say that they were safe, no matter where they were.

At the same time, no replacement had been made for the twelfth family head. Instead, Bryce was giving out orders to the family using Jill's ability mostly. Telling them to organize themselves, and they were essentially being self-sufficient. There was no leader in the castle, causing them to somewhat panic as well.

Regardless, Bryce didn't care because he believed that everything was temporary. Once he got rid of Arthur, he could assign a new leader to the twelfth family, and everything would go back to normal.

——

At the moment, Erin, Leo, and Silver were staying in the thirteenth castle. The king rarely dropped by, especially with what was going on at the moment. Yet, even now in the tenth castle, there seemed to always be a pair of eyes somewhere on them. The king would often send royal guards there to check if Quinn or any other punishers had returned. So they decided it was safer for them to stay with Lee and the others with everything going on.

An important meeting was currently taking place, as Muka was updating Silver and the others on their new plans. Since their last meeting, Silver had told them about the information about Arthur's hit list. The leaders who met up from before, apart from Paul and instead Erin was present with them, were sitting in a smaller room with a round table.

They didn't want anyone, including members of the thirteenth family, to be aware of what was going on. Because they were treading into more dangerous territory as they found and gathered more information.

The fewer people connected, the less likely to be found out, and if they were found out, they hoped fewer people would be dragged into the whole mess.

"After what you informed me, I have been doing some research. Going through the files, I found out about those that went on the expedition along with Bryce at the time." Muka said as he threw a piece of paper that had a record of all those that had gone on the expedition out on the table.

What Silver didn't realize, looking at this was that the list was far bigger than she thought.

"This…is, Arthur is going to go through them all?" Silver asked.

"We can't be so sure," Sunny said. "After all, so far, Arthur seemed to have only gone for the leaders, the vampire knights, and anyone who is in a higher position than that. Maybe he believes that the other vampires were just forced to come along, not knowing what they were doing."

"Or perhaps he is only dealing with the people he thinks needs his punishment," Lee suggested.

"Or he could be saving them for later," Jin said. This, of course, was the obvious thing, but Sunny or Lee didn't want to say it, as if saying those words would make it come true.

"Thanks to your group, we have found out the reason why Arthur is attacking the vampires, and some of us can ease up even if it is only a little," Muka said. "Since Arthur didn't deal with you, we can assume he has decided to stay quite strict to this list, but there are still many problems we have to deal with, especially those that he brings with him.

"Knowing about this expedition, nearly half the leaders were involved. We can't use their testimony. The others will back that said person up or finish them before they even get the chance.

"Which means the only thing we can still do, find out the truth about what Bryce is doing with the missing vampires. It seems like the two matters might not be linked after all. My best bet is we will find out the answer in the king's castle.

"It's the safest place for Bryce since not even the leaders can freely enter that place. However, I am sure that Arthur will attack again soon. Bryce knows who Arthur is after, so the best move would be to enter the king's castle during the next attack.

"Most likely, since he has gone after one Royal knight, they will assume he will go after the other. Bryce will stay by his side to set some type of trap. So the castle should be easy to navigate. I know it was a close call last time, and it is hard for me to ask you this again, but you are the only ones that can do this."

Silver was a bit hesitant. She felt like with the way Arthur was acting, if they had tried to get in his way, in his way of completing his revenge, they could have easily suffered as well. When Leo got close and Erin looked to have nearly hurt him, Arthur had no choice but to fight back.

"We'll do it." Erin surprisingly spoke up and was speaking as if it was for the others.

"Erin," Leo said in a tone as if he was telling off his own daughter. "I know you wish to test yourself or prove yourself, but remember we need to think about not just us, but the rest of the family. If we get caught, then the tenth will be in far more trouble than when we were heading towards the twelfth family castle.

"What I am far more concerned about is what Arthur plans to do after and whether or not the vampires can stop him. If we don't figure that out, then this whole conversation and everything that we are doing could very well be completely useless."

The other leaders present didn't want to admit it, but Leo had a point. The settlement in thier mind had always existed and always would.

Another thought on Leo's mind was if the leaders were still taking the Dalki as a minor threat because they hadn't even been considered in the conversation.

"We will do it," Leo said. "But if there is any sign that we will get caught. We will abandon our mission. This is a task to find out information. Not to fight any of the guards or the others inside."

As the meeting came to an end, and everyone was ready to relax for the rest of the day, or at least as much as possible, they could see the dark shadow that appeared above, covering all of the castles.

Seconds later, and a repeat of what had happened last time had occurred. The Dalki were falling from the sky along with the masked vampires.

The attack was happening again.

*****

# Chapter 1341 - What My Powers Can Do
As soon as the dark shadow appeared above them, all of the vampires started to panic. However, this time, they were more prepared. None of the pooling vampires could match up to the Masked or the Dalki and would most likely just add to the body count, so they had been told to stay in their homes in each of the castles.

However, they were also told to be prepared to fight for their lives if necessary. In a fight against their enemy, numbers didn't mean much. The actual castle vampires and the original castle vampires were the ones who were to do battle.

This was how it had been set up, through most of the families. Apart from one, who had decided to have all the pooling vampires stay in the castle instead. These were those from the thirteenth family.

The vampires belonging to the family castle, and the inner castle vampires would go out to face the enemy, while the pooling vampires would bunker up in the castle, with a few vampires left behind to protect them. The main reason for this was because Lee wanted to prevent anyone finding out about the thirteenth family's secret for as long as possible.

The leader had been surprised that after using the inner blood weapons last time, nobody had reported them, but had eventually accepted that due to the chaos of the situation nobody might have cared, but when the whole thing was to blow over, it could mean serious repercussions for the thirteenth family.

The Dalki, and the Masked started to fall from the large black shadow in the sky just like last time. Not understanding the skill or how someone was able to do such a thing, the only thing the castles could do was wait till they landed, but there was one, odd fellow that was falling through the sky with them.

"What the heck is going on? Why am I suddenly falling?!" Agent 11's face was flapping as the wind hit his mouth and the ground was getting closer to him by the second. One moment he had been in a strange lab, and the next in a dark space.

While in the dark space, the Pure agent had been on his own, wandering around trying to find someone or something to get him out. He assumed that it was the ability of the man they had met earlier. Every ability should have a weakness, so Agent 11 assumed he just needed to figure it out.

However, after a few hours, he found himself in the position he was in now, falling through the sky. There was a Dalki, next to him but it was too far away from him to reach. Looking down again, Agent 11 knew that using Qi wouldn't help him much in this situation. At best it might prevent his immediate death, but he would still suffer fatal injuries.

Panicking and thinking of what he could possibly do, he noticed that Fex still had his strings attached to him via the needle; they were nearly impossible to see, but they had remained in Agent 11's body when he was taken to the dark room.

Reaching around the back of his neck he pulled out one of the needles.

'Damn it, I hope this works.' Agent 11 ran his finger down from the needle and could feel the string until he reached the end holding it firmly in place, then with the needle, he started to concentrate. He circulated the first stage of Qi through his muscles, and the second stage of Qi, through the needle to make it sharper.

At the right time, he threw it at the Dalki, managing to hit it in the shoulder, the needle piercing right through. Then pulling the string, he pulled his body towards the Dalki. Agent 11's body was approaching the creature, and with his legs charging in first he kicked off the Masked who had been riding on top.

"Phew, looks like I'm sa-"

A bang was heard and a dust cloud was lifted, for seconds after the Dalki had landed on the ground. Agent 11 quickly jumped off from the Dalki to see where he was, only to find himself in a strange area, full of mansions, but more importantly there was clearly what looked like a war going on.

A Blood swipe was thrown out from behind almost hitting the Pure agent, but before it did, a strong black horned rabbit jumped on his shoulder, and powering its horn fired off a lightning attack hitting the aura and saving Agent 11's life.

"What are you doing just standing there?!" A vampire who came running over yelled at him, and soon the black rabbit hopped back onto the shoulder of the vampire.

"That Rabbit saved my life, does it belong to you?" Agent 11 asked in confusion.

"I'm Rokene, a castle vampire from the fifth family, listen to my order and either fight, or get in one of the houses!" Rokene shouted.

It was then that the Dalki that Agent 11 had landed on, had almost come to, turning around and looking at the two of them.

Agent 11 was still confused about how they had come to this world, and even the Cursed faction he was with were cautious of the V. He didn't quite know what was going on or whose side he was even supposed to be. Still, he was sure about one thing. Dalki were humanity's enemy, this kid had just saved his life and he wasn't someone who didn't repay favours.

Agent 11 grabbed his sword and charged towards the Dalki, avoiding its strikes and cutting it in certain places. He hated to admit it, but with the fighting style Fex had utilised while controlling him, he himself had managed to further improve his swordsmanship.

Rokene, seeing how skilled the Pure agent was, felt that with the two of them and with his familiar, they could easily take on the Dalki.

——

At the tenth castle, Paul ran towards his balcony, as soon as the shadow had appeared.

"Remember your training everyone! The Dalki blood empowers us, so get ready to put it to good use!!!" Paul shouted.

Those that had flasks started to consume it immediately, the others were a bit cautious but when a few of them started to praise the new energy they could feel inside of them, they all started to drink the packs of green blood that had been handed out.

"This, I actually feel so invigorated and it tastes sweeter than human blood. What is happening to us?"

"I thought we couldn't consume blood of beasts, so why are we able to consume their blood?"

It didn't make sense to a lot of the vampires, but it didn't have to either.

With the power of the green blood, the gargoyles and towers, Paul was going to make sure that the tenth family came out of this whole thing with the least amount of casualties.

———

Bryce had decided it was time to go out to the pooling area once more, only this time he wasn't going there alone. Alongside him was Kyle Dawn, his remaining Royal Knight, as well as some Royal guards. Additionally he had made Jill and Harlu Dawn, the current 7th leader, tag along.

Just like last time, the force that was composed of mostly Dalki landed in the pooling area, but Bryce was confident. He could tell that Arthur was going after all those who had gone on that expedition, so those that were most important on the Punisher's hit list were currently gathered in this place.

If Arthur wanted to take a single one of them out, he would need to bring the fight here.

The battle started and with the Royal guards and everyone else there, the fighting was much easier than the last time. King Bryce hardly had to do anything himself.

"You have no clue what my powers can do." Arthur's voice suddenly resounded in the open place.

The voice was heard by everyone there, but no matter how much Bryce and the others turned around, Arthur was nowhere to be seen.

"Where is Harlu?!" Kyle eventually shouted, as he used his cape to block the attack of a Dalki, and pierced through its head with its hand soon after. "I can't find him anywhere."

Jill searched, the Royal guards searched but they could see nothing, and a few seconds later, they saw a shadow open up, only for a familiar looking body to fall to the ground.

"Another one off the list."

The body was none other than the new twelfth leader Harlu Dawn. Harlu had only been a few meters away from Bryce, yet the King had been unable to save him from the Punisher.

*****

# Chapter 1342 - Not Even An Original
When the attack started, the trio didn't waste any time complying with the mission they had agreed upon. Travelling through the tunnels, they had done so with Muka and the other leaders for the first part of their journey.

This was because they needed to get back to their castles to give orders and to help as quickly as possible. If anyone saw they had all come from the thirteenth family as well, then it would raise suspicion on what this group was planning to do.

At times like this, usually, they could have used Jill to send out messages to their respective knights on what to do, but that would be a red flag straight away if she was to find out about it. Especially now, she was basically Bryce's dog, held by an invisible chain who stayed by him at all times now.

"Remember, this time, we will be avoiding any confrontation if possible." Leo reminded them as they ran through the tunnels. Muka had already opened the one that led to the king's castle, and the leaders split, so now they just needed to travel a little further before reaching the place.

"Unlike the last mission, we are just to search where the missing people are, or if there are any missing people at all."

When Leo spoke, Erin knew that this was directed at her. She didn't know if it was due to her fight with Arthur, but her lust was returning slightly. Leo had noticed this based on how much of the suppression chains she had wrapped around her forearms.

After killing a few vampires and slowly weaning her urge from them, Leo thought that she was fine, but maybe that wasn't the case when coming across more complete or stronger vampires.

The three of them could see the entrance up ahead, and they wore the same uniforms they were in last time, Covering themselves with cloaks and masks. Since no one was left alive who had seen them, there was no problem with them using them again.

The tunnel eventually started to lead upward. The familiar trap door that was stationed underneath all of the castles was seen. Silver went ahead and was ready to move it but looked towards Leo and Erin for confirmation that no one was on the other side.

Yet strangely, the two of them were looking in a completely different direction.

"What's wrong?" Silver asked.

"There's something in this castle, something compelling, no that's not right, there is something under this castle", Leo said, and it looked like both of them could sense it since Erin was looking in the direction as well.

"Underground, but that's impossible. There shouldn't be anything underground. Other than other tunnels." Silver said. "Are you saying that someone is here with us?"

Leo shook his head, but he didn't answer either because, truth be told, he didn't know what the energy was, but he had felt something similar before. Underneath each of the other castles were where the tombs would be located. With the tombs, he could sense the slight presence as if there was some type of excess power keeping them alive for all those that were in their eternal sleep.

"Are there any tombs under the king's castle?" Erin asked, having the same thoughts as Leo.

"There shouldn't be." Silver replied. "Even the king is buried with their original family when they choose to go into eternal slumber. So all of the elders, past kings, royal knights, all get returned to the tombs where their families live."

With that answer, it just made Leo wonder why there was an energy source under the king's castle and why was there only a single one as well. Regardless, their mission wasn't to look into this but to look into other matters.

After checking that no one was present, the trap door was lifted, and they entered the king's castle. This time, they had to be far more cautious than they did when entering the twelfth castle.

"There are still a large bulk of the Royal Guards inside, and we don't know how long the fight will last this time before the attack stops outside," Leo said.

"Let's just hope we aren't too unlucky to run into Arthur twice this time." Silver replied.

The king's castle was around twice the size of all the other castles from the other leaders. It seemed quite unnecessary for hardly anyone lived in the place. When looking around, most of the walls were just covered in paintings of the past kings and queens' achievements.

"Where do you think we should head to, the throne room? Or the Council room?" Silver asked.

"No, the last time I was there, I didn't notice anything. My suggestion would be one of two things. Either the place would be somewhere that is heavily guarded by the Royal guard or if it is even a secret from them. It would be a place where no guards were placed at all." Leo said.

Following this logic, Silver and Erin agreed that this was too big a matter for the Royal guards to be involved in. So they searched each floor of the cult where there were few guards or next to none. This benefited their search as well since it was easy to look In places with fewer guards.

So far, they had found nothing and eventually reached the second-highest floor, just underneath the throne room. There were the most guards stationed on this floor. Yet, suddenly, Leo could sense someone rushing up the stairs, and all of them quickly entered one of the rooms nearby.

"The castle, the second leader, has entered, and the situation is getting out of hand. We need help. He is refusing to listen and is attacking us!" The Royal guard reported.

"Inform king Bryce straight away, send a group out, while we will try to stop him and see what he wants." The other replied, and the group protecting the second floor were gone just like that heading down to the entrance.

"The second leader, as in the Original Tempus? What is he doing here, and why is he fighting against the Royal guards?" Silver asked.

"We should just be thankful that this distraction has given us time to search for what we need," Leo replied.

Now they were able to check the entire floor freely.

Eventually, their search had led them to a library. The library was enormous and reminded both Leo and Erin of the library that they had at their military school. There were three floors just like at the school, only the floors seemed to go on for far longer and wider.

"What is all of this? Why so many books?" Erin asked.

"I assume it's just a collection of all sorts of things. Things collected by the kings, I wouldn't have a clue, honestly. In the first place, this castle is really only limited to a select few even in the vampire society." Silver replied. "This would be a place that I would have probably never seen in my lifetime."

Ignoring their conversation, Leo continued to move around the library. In the first place, he didn't have a care for books. He wasn't the best reader anyway. He looked to be heading to a particular place in mind, and then on the second floor, in the corner down one of the isles, Leo stopped.

"This…is the place." When Leo spoke, he seemed to be nervous, but maybe that was because he knew what exactly was on the other side.

"Is there anyone inside?" Silver asked.

"No, it's just, you will see," Leo said.

He took a few books off the shelf, and behind a type of lever was shown. It was an old fashioned design. Pulling it, the bookcase began to move.

——

On the bottom floor of the king's castle, at the moment, the Royal guards, who all had the strength of a Vampire knight, had surrounded the second leader.

"I knew you wouldn't listen to me. How dare you point your weapons at an original. It's because of me that some of you are even here in the first place!" Tempus shouted with anger.

"This is the king's castle, and not even originals are allowed here. Please leave, sir! Until we get authorisation from the king!" One of the guards shouted.

"Authorisation from the king? He wouldn't listen to me no matter how many times I spoke. Why do you think I'm here in the first place?"

*****

# Chapter 1343 - Trespassers
The entire library shelf slowly slid to the side, but to a certain degree both Erin and Leo had already been able to see what was on the other side. There were no signs of life, but their ability had allowed them to see the outline of everything and it struck deeply in both of them.

Silver, who was the most hopeful of the lot that they might finally find what they had been looking for, was ready to go in as soon as possible, until a sudden horrid smell hit her nose. It was so putrid, so vile that she nearly threw up in an instant.

"This smell." Silver said, her eyes widening as she had figured it out, it was the smell of death. It wasn't as if Vampire knight had never experienced or seen death before, but this was something completely different.

Rushing in, Silver went to confirm her suspicions and that was when she could see it. The room was dark, being lit up by light crystals on the side, but it was also quite vast inside. In front of her, was what could only be described as an entire pit of deceased vampires.

It looked like an empty giant swimming pool, but what was worse was the fact it wasn't filled with water, instead it was filled with bodies.

"These must be the missing people! Are any of them…" Silver didn't even want to ask the question because she couldn't hear a single heartbeat from any of them.

"No, none of them are alive. I could see their bodies through the door. '' Leo replied. "The sheer number… there must be hundreds of vampire corpses here."

"But why…why did Bryce store them? Why kill them? What was he doing with their bodies, or what is he planning to do with their bodies?" Erin asked.

Strangely, Silver's next action surprised them both, as she suddenly jumped right onto the pile of bodies. The Vampire knight began searching through and pulled some of them out to the side.

"Shouldn't we leave the bodies as they are? If they return then…" Erin was trying to help, but Leo just grabbed her and shook his head.

"Let her do what needs to be done. All of this will need to come to light anyway." The Blind Swordsman explained.

Silver was pulling out the members that belonged to her own family. They had died with their clothing intact showing their family emblem, and tears couldn't stop form her face as she wondered what or why their lives had ended this way.

Despite being a Vampire knight, nearly all of them were vampires she didn't know and those taken from the pooling area, but there were even some inner castle vampires among those dead. Each one with a few simple wounds.

"Based on the wounds on their body and the expression on their faces, they couldn't have seen that their death was coming. It must have been done by someone who was able to overpower them in one strike since there are no signs of other wounds." Leo noted.

"How do we report this? What should we even do, now we've discovered this? There is a chance that Bryce was just storing them here for now. What happens if he gets rid of them or burns their bodies?" Erin asked.

This certainly was the tricky part. Even if they filmed the scene before them, with today's technology nearly everything could be faked. It also wasn't the right time to show this to the vampires while they were focusing on another problem.

"I swear, I will make Bryce pay for everything he has done!" Silver stated with determination, getting up from the ground and jumping out of the pit of bodies. "He is not fit to be a King! How could someone who cares so little about the lives of his fellow vampires have been elected king in the first place?!"

'Sometimes people get blinded or get upset by the words of others and those around them. It was just nature for beings to act that way', but Leo could tell it was not the time for one of his lectures.

"This place might have been untouched. Bryce has been busy with the attack, so I assume until he accomplishes whatever his goal is, there might be no need for him to return to this room. As for the other vampires, if you remember those from your inner castle, see if they know anything. You might be able to talk to their friends and find out how exactly these people had gone missing in the first place."

"If we can follow the trail we should be able to find people that can help us. The only thing we still have yet to find out is why they need to do this. What was he after? Was it their blood crystal?"

Inspecting the bodies more thoroughly they found out that although the blood crystal had been removed from all of them, it seemed more like an afterthought than the real reason for their death. Some of the killing attacks had been so close to where the blood crystal would be present according to Silver.

"We've done what we can, so it's time for us to leave this place." Leo determined.

There was still the top floor of the castle to check out, the throne room and the King's bedroom to see. Although they didn't think they would find any more bodies there, they at least believed that they might be able to find out information on what Bryce was trying to do.

However, after entering both areas they found nothing and were unable to access the special vault that could only be opened by gathering the blood of each of the leaders.

"It looks like we only have one choice then." Erin said. "We need to talk to Kazz. She clearly knows what her father was doing. That's probably why she told Paul not to look into the missing people."

"I find it hard to believe that Kazz would turn in her father if he was committing such crimes." Silver replied. "I have known her for the longest time and her father…is everything to her."

"Maybe…but maybe you underestimate the girl." Leo put his two cents forward. "In the end, she did agree to help us out. If we tell her what we know then perhaps, this will be the push for her to realise that her father has crossed the line. That this is completely wrong."

It was then that Leo could sense an energy coming towards them incredibly fast, and Erin could as well. She immediately pulled her smaller blood weapon out since it was quicker to use then the one on her back.

Silver was the slowest to act, but when the doors opened they could see who it was.

"Well, what a surprise! Now who do we have here and what exactly were you planning to do?" Tempus asked, clapping his hands as he discovered the trio. Neither one of them responded as all were trying to decide what to do. In the throne room there was only one entrance and exit. If they wanted to get out they would have to fight the second leader.

"Well, at least he isn't as scary as Arthur." Silver whispered.

"I can't argue with that. That Punisher is beyond scary. He wasn't this powerful during my time, but he truly is a force to be reckoned with, don't you agree my dear strangers?" Tempus spoke in a weird tone.

"I have tried to tell the King time and time again, and it looks like he has just lost another one of his precious leaders. This probably has to be the worst reign in vampire history. Well, maybe the second worst."

"You stranger must have entered the King's castle because you believe, like me, that Bryce is failing in a spectacular way. Now, I don't know who you are and frankly I don't care, but if our goals align, why not help each other?"

"I won't mention that you were trespassing, nor will I try to stop you from leaving this place… as long as you help me look for something in particular. You see this entire castle was built to hide something. A single tomb, but I have no idea where that tomb could be located. I was looking for some type of map or blueprints. So what do you think about my deal?" Tempus asked.

It was a strange situation to say the least, yet the offer was strangely enticing.

*****

# Chapter 1344 - A Message To The Settlement
It was safe to say that Bryce was beyond mad at the loss of Harlu Dawn. As soon as he saw his body lay there on the ground, the King no longer tried to conserve his energy in this fight. Bryce lifted his sword, and just like last time the blood that was out on the field started to wrap around it.

It wasn't limited to vampire blood, even Dalki blood moved towards the sword. While Bryce was busy gathering the blood and staying in place, his Royal Knight, despite the loss of his family member, knew he had a job to do, so he was busy protecting his King.

His cape was capable of blocking nearly anything, and he was doing just that to prevent any of the attacks from getting through. This time there were no losses on the vampire side in the pooling area, as the Royal guards were able to fight in such a formation and way that allowed them to cover from each other.

It was completely different to how the other vampires would fight. It looked as if only the Royal guards had been trained to fight as one unit. While in the other castles it was more similar to a free for all.

As for Jill, she just continued to stay by Bryce's side, standing there, watching the whole fight go on, until she muttered certain words.

"Maybe we deserve to die." Jill muttered to herself.

Bryce was the only one close enough to have caught that. He looked at her from the corner of his eye. His large sword was complete but then he started to form smaller swords from the blood as well. Finally, they all moved outward, aimed at the remaining Dalki forces.

They went through the Dalki's chest, killing them in one hit, but after piercing their initial target, they didn't stop there. The swords continued to fly through the sky going through each and everyone of the Dalki.

The attack was so powerful that it was almost impossible for them to stop, even if they lifted up their hands to block, or strike the attack would end up piercing their hard scales, and if they tried to avoid the attack or run away, as their numbers lowered, eventually more swords could be used for the attack.

Some of the Dalki figured out that their only way out would be to kill off the one who controlled them. A task which should be easy in theory since he was staying still, but Kyle demonstrated how loyal a knight he was. In the end all of the Dalki fell under the power of the flying swords. The ten smaller ones surrounded the single large one that hovered in the air.

As soon as Bryce stopped using his powers, the blood swords fell to the ground leaving a blood mark in their place. The larger sword revealed Bryce's trademark cane sword underneath, though the King left a small trace amount of blood on it as a precaution.

It flew at him with great speed, yet he effortlessly caught it in one hand.

The fight was over where they were but they could hear that the other castles were still in the midst of fending off the intruders. Kyle had decided to take his time to check up on Harlu, hoping to figure out what Arthur had done to him. He lovingly lifted his body from the ground and examined it. From what he could see there was only a hole in the chest of the deceased.

"It looks like he has granted you a swift death, my son. You lived a long life, but no parent should have to bury their child." Kyle whispered, as he carried his body, hoping to take it back to the family castle.

It was then that Kyle was left frozen in place, for he couldn't believe what he had seen. He had only turned away for a few seconds and now he could see that Bryce had stabbed his sword right through the back of Jill.

"I gave you a chance to live when I had the right to kill you for becoming a traitor. You said it yourself earlier, that we all deserve to die. It looks like I should have done this sooner, and now Arthur won't have the pleasure of killing you himself." Bryce said.

Jill's hand was reaching out to Kyle who was in front of her. It looked like she wanted to say something but blood had already filled her mouth, and it seemed like she had accepted her death long ago. Something resembling a smile crept on her face.

That was when Jill herself realised that ever since her family had broken up, and she had been given this role, she had already lost her life. Everything after that point had only been Bryce using her like a puppet. She had hoped that serving the King might allow her to pay for her sins, but it had just added to them. That's why she decided to do one last thing.

'Everyone…the King has gone mad… Bryce Cain has been abducting people from your families…killing them…and has been sacrificing them against their will… against the leaders' will to somehow beat Arthur…'

'And now… he has killed me in cold blood…the real threat is not Arthur…we need to stop the-'

At that moment, Jill had decided to use her ability of telepathy to send a message out to everyone in the vampire settlement. No matter where they were, or what they were doing. The only exception to this was the one person who had attacked her.

Jill wanted to say more. With her death so close at hand, why should she protect her killer's secret? The former family leader had intended to reveal the existence of Arthur's list and how the other vampires didn't have to worry too much, and about the other horrifying things that the King had done, but the stab hadn't been a simple stab.

Bryce had decided to kill her slowly. If he had wanted to finish her off quickly, he could have sliced her head off, yet he had deliberately chosen to stab her through the stomach and back to prolong the pain.

However, vampires were great healers and a stab wound eventually heal. That's why King Bryce infused his blood powers into the sword that was still in her body to destroy her from the inside. It was incredibly painful. The pain had overwhelmed her, stopping her from sending out the rest of her message.

Jill passed away and fell to the ground. Pulling his sword out from Jill, Bryce used his Blood control to splatter the blood of his sword onto the ground. He then looked towards Kyle and the rest of the Royal guards, who were just as frozen.

"Now it is just me and you left on the list. If he is only going after the leaders behind that mess you know what that means, but I won't let him." Bryce said.

Right now, it was hard for Kyle to look into the eyes of Bryce, the King who he had vowed to follow, because even when he did, it looked like his ruler was never directly looking at him. After hearing the message Jill left, Kyle couldn't imagine what this meant for Bryce.

Unless they would go against all the leaders who would try to get rid of him, then there was no chance that he would remain King. Unfortunately, as his associate, he wouldn't come out unscathed either. It was impossible for someone like him who had allowed the other to do such things to be pardoned, Kyle himself no longer had any choice.

His only worry was whether Bryce would kill him next. This old man was more unstable than he had ever been. It wouldn't even surprise him if he would sacrifice the guards who had been with them in the foreseeable future.

"We are going to finish this today!" Bryce shouted. "Go to the King's castle, and retrieve them. Bring them here immediately!"

"Your Majesty." Kyle replied but then stopped himself when Bryce seemingly ignored him. Before going to the King's castle he wanted to go to his own family to check if they were safe and to make sure his boy's bodies would be in safe hands.

"That bastard managed to kill your son, don't worry we will pay him back. I should have done this in the first place. If he won't reveal himself, we will just have to force him to come out. We will head to the fourteenth castle, and destroy all of it."

"Everything that ever belonged to that Punisher, anything he ever touched, and any sign of that damned shadow. All of it will be purged from this universe!" Bryce shouted in anger.

# Chapter 1345 - The Castles Special
Inside the king's castle, in the throne room, Leo and the others had just heard the offer from the second leader, the original known as Tempus. The group didn't answer straight away. The truth was they wanted to converse with each other, but even if they did, it would be hard for them without Tempus listening to their conversation.

In a situation like this, Silver would often let Leo do the talking. She felt like this because they were the ones that were dragged into this mess in the first place, making her feel guilty. She felt like she had no right to make any decision on their behalf.

If they wished to try to fight their way out of this, then she would too. If they chose to accept the offer, then she would as well, but there was one thing she needed to confirm and get out of her mind because she didn't quite understand what was going on.

"There's a tomb under this castle? What do you mean? I have never heard of this before? Who is it, and why do you want to wake them up?" Silver asked, trying to get more information and also trying to buy more time for the others to make a decision.

"I almost forgot that everything about him was erased so you all know nothing. Perhaps only your current king would know the truth," Tempus explained. "I am of course, talking about the first king, and no, I am not talking about the tenth family Eno.

"The true first king who they tried to erase from vampire history. Right now, Arthur is a vampire that is stronger than anything I have seen. Perhaps it's because the two share the same power but regardless.

"The true first king was a special vampire, even more special than Eno. He was the most powerful vampire to ever exist. If we want the vampire race to continue to live, then we have no choice but to summon him!" Tempus said.

Just hearing these words, it was hard for Silver to believe. They spent years in school learning about the vampire's history. Still, she soon remembered that the vampires did indeed try to cover up many things. There were significant blank periods, and even recently, things like Cindy's past had come to light that was never known before.

"So why is Bryce so scared of summoning him?" Erin eventually spoke. "If it's an easy solution and this vampire is as strong as you say he is, then why don't they summon him, and why did the vampires choose to get rid of his past.

"I've learned that the vampires often like to try to erase the bad from their history as if it never happened. So there had to be a reason for erasing this."

"The vampires?" Tempus repeated, finding it strange that she was referring to her own race as such.

"Of course, they are just scared. We, original vampires, are all friends. I assure you I wouldn't be trying to wake him up if I thought he would do us harm. I, just like you, are trying to save the vampire settlement, not harm it. Anyway, you are wasting my time, so tell me what you plan to do?"

While the two sides were in silence, a specific message played in all of their heads. The message that had come from Jill. Bringing Bryce's wrongdoing to light.

"Did you both hear that?" Silver asked.

Leo and Erin both nodded.

"Well, it looks like Bryce's wrongdoings have come to light. Now we have no choice. Do you think someone who wished to become king for so long will be able to give up the throne just because the leaders say so?

"Even if he defeats Arthur, then we will have another problem on our hands. With the absolute blood powers, there will be no one who can stop him."

With the information spread out, it looked like they no longer had to worry about having trespassed in the king's castle or worry about the evidence seemingly having gone missing. Their testimony and Jill's words would be pretty convincing to almost anyone.

The question was, could the three of them take on the Original in front of them. The original's powers varied in strength, and they were all slightly special. The fact that Tempus looked unworried was worrying Silver.

On top of that, she agreed that someone would have to take care of them if Bryce or Arthur won this fight. The absolute blood book would make one the strongest vampire.

'There was one person that stopped someone last time, but could they stop Bryce as well?' Silver thought.

Since the standstill between the two seemed to be going nowhere. Tempus was getting tired and started to walk towards the three masked people.

"Well, if you can't make a decision, I guess it's time I unmask you guys," Tempus said. "I would at least like to know who you are.

Erin stepped forward and was ready to charge in, but Leo stopped her using the butt of his blade.

"We will help you look for the tomb. After we find it, let us go peacefully." Leo said.

Both of the girls were surprised at Leo's answer, but at the same time, they trusted him. In the first place, Silver thought that if there was such a tomb that Erin and Leo should have been able to find it with their ability already, so she just needed to wait and see exactly what he was planning to do.

"Excellent!" Tempus replied. "I assure you you won't regret it, and as you know, us leaders always repay our debts. Bringing him back, if there is any need, he will be sure to help you all."

The other three didn't say anything and began their search in the throne room to see if there was anything they could find. Erin and Silver stuck close together, while Leo would slowly approach Tempus, getting closer and closer each time to see if he would do anything.

"Oh please, if I wanted to hurt you, I would have done so a long time ago," Tempus said, noticing their strange actions. "Look, for you three to come in here on your own, I gather you are strong. So it would be a pain to fight you guys. And I have my task to do. This is a win-win for us both."

In the end, after searching the throne room and finding nothing, Tempus went to sit on the throne and looked to be a little disappointed.

"I thought sitting here would feel a bit special. Or perhaps I would get kicked off or something." Tempus sighed.

"What are we exactly looking for?" Silver asked.

"Well, there seem to be no blueprints to this place, but I'm looking for a type of circle. Hmm… honestly, I don't know how much I should tell to you three strangers, but you should at least know how the leaders' powers are linked to their castles.

"At the same time, there is a ritual that has to take place when a new leader is selected. Well, all of that was set up and designed by one of the originals. Setting certain rules, society, and more. So not anyone can just force their way to become a leader.

"Anyway, the king's castle is a bit different. As you can see, no matter what, all of the crystals on the outside are powered. This is true even if the king dies. Do you know why that is? Because the system set up for this castle wasn't linked to the selected king's power but was linked to the true king's power instead.

"However, these castles were built using amazing Ma- let's just say built amazingly. Sometimes the castles themselves are the ones that select their leaders? Don't you think that is truly amazing in itself?"

Castles selecting leaders, the more Silver was listening to the Original ramble on, the more she wasn't making sense of anything. Everything she had learned from the vampires was falling apart. The way Tempus was talking, it was as if the castles were alive.

"What I'm trying to say is, even this castle in all its time has never accepted anyone else but the first true king. There has to be a link somewhere to find out where its source of energy is."

It was at that moment that Leo sensed something., Underneath them, he could tell that someone had returned to the castle and had done so with more of the guards that had the same strength as those stationed inside. He thought that maybe they were coming to their room, but that's when he noticed that they had gone to the library and soon entered a particular room, where the dead were found.

'What are they planning to do with them?' Leo wondered, and there was a good chance that they might need to stop whatever they were going to attempt to do.

"Why don't we head to the library? Maybe there is something in there that we can find related to the castle," Leo suggested.

Tempus looked at Leo strangely for a few seconds and a short while later before any of them could answer. Leo could feel the mask underneath his cloak vibrate.

"Communications are back online." The voice from the mask said. "We can communicate with each other and the ship again. If you can return to the castle immediately."

*****

# Chapter 1346 - Make A Choice
The one who had sent out the message to Leo was none other than Xander from the tenth. He didn't know what situation Leo would be in, but it was an urgent matter to contact the others. Since they weren't fully aware about who might be around the Blind Swordsman, the content of the message had been vague enough to not leak any secrets or the family's identity.

Paul had ordered Xander to consistently check if the communication channels might open up, and eventually, seemingly out of nowhere, they started to work. The oddest thing was that it had happened in the midst of the attack from the Dalki and the masked forces.

Nonetheless, Xander immediately informed Paul about this discovery. Due to the situation at the tenth castle being far better than anywhere else, the Vampire knight had been able to simply give out commands without having to go in personally. Once notified, he immediately headed back inside the castle to safely talk to the others.

It was then that Paul was informed that the Cursed ship had been trying to get into contact with them for the longest time. The Vampire knight didn't hesitate to reach out to Sam on the off-chance that the communication might get cut off again at any moment.

"Paul, you finally called us back! We couldn't get in contact with you for a while now, so we thought something had gone wrong!" Sam sounded panicked on his end.

"That assumption isn't necessarily wrong. Things haven't exactly been smooth here." Paul replied and gave the other a brief overview about the situation in the Vampire World. The thing that neither of them could figure out was why the communication devices had so suddenly started working again.

"But you're saying that the teleporter is still out of commission?" Sam questioned, which the other confirmed. "That's too bad, I had considered sending some people through the other teleporter. The special one Logan created, but for some reason it seems to be offline as well. … we just got news ourselves…"

"If the Vampire World wasn't in chaos, I was about to request your help." Sam then went on to explain to Paul what exactly the Cursed faction was facing at the moment. Both sides were in a pickle, and neither one really afford to go out and really help out the other. However, there was one person they needed to inform about the dire situation, because it was up to him on how to deal with it.

"Let me be the one to notify him, but before that I have to ask whether you've received any news about Linda's and Fex's arrival? Before it went offline we did manage to send the two of them over to your side to check up on the Dragon."

There was silence on the other end, though not because the communication had been cut. No, Paul needed to ask Timmy and Xander if they had heard such news, yet neither one did. The two from the Cursed faction were supposed to be here secretly so it would make sense if they hadn't revealed themselves. They tried to contact them via their masks that should always be with them, yet there was no response.

"Nobody saw them and it's not possible to reach them over the masks. Until we know what happened to them. Let's get in contact with Quinn and see what he wants to do." Paul suggested. Agreeing to this, Sam proceeded to give him a call.

It was at this point and time that Quinn and the others had finished their trials and had received the call from Sam, obtaining the bad news about the Vampire World.

"If the tenth castle is in trouble, I'll travel to Linda immediately and help out there. I can get back to you guys immediately, while those two can travel back to you once the teleporter works again." Quinn immediately volunteered.

Sam wanted to say more, since he still hadn't fully explained the situation with the Cursed Faction yet, but before he could, Quinn had already attempted to find the connection to Linda. However, he was unable to connect to her shadow at all.

'Why can't I connect to her? Has she turned it off completely? That's strange… where exactly is her shadow? I can still feel the others, so there should be no problem on that end. I didn't get any system message either so she shouldn't be dead, but it's almost as if completely disappeared.' Quinn thought.

Still on the call, he asked the one person that might know a little more.

"They should be in the Vampire World, but according to Paul they were unable to get into contact with them. We were thinking of sending a team through to see if they were okay but the teleporter there isn't working either."

This only made Quinn think that perhaps the two of them had been caught, and the teleporter they had come form might have been destroyed. Linda was currently the only one on the vampire planet with the Shadow ability. Without her, his Shadow link was useless.

"Quinn before you decide anything, there's something I need to tell you. I didn't want to do this, but the Cursed faction is facing a problem of our own right now." Sam reported while Quinn was still thinking about what to do. "The Cursed planets… the one that Helen and her sisters are on… it's under attack by the Dalki."

"We are unsure about the size of their forces since we only got a report recently, but our guess is it's a big one. The teleporters are still online there, so we can go, and if you use your Shadow link to travel back here you can do as well."

It was the worst timing, the Cursed faction and the vampire settlements were both in trouble, but it was then that Quinn also realised something. Quinn could get to the Cursed planets relatively quickly since there were plenty of people with the Shadow ability, but the same wasn't true for the vampire planet.

However, right now he was quite close to it. Travelling by ship it would take him a few hours to get there, but if he left with his Shadow link, there was no way for him to get back. He had no idea about what had happened to Linda, so there was no way to tell when the connection to her would appear again.

And for some reason he wasn't able to connect to Arthur's shadow. Even if he could, at this point and time jumping right where he would be wasn't a good call.

Should he choose to help the Cursed faction out, then there was no way to tell if he would make it back in time to help out the vampire settlement.

"Quinn." Sam spoke up. "Do you remember what that Bliss person said? That there would be a time where you had to choose. I think this might be it. I think she was telling you that you would have to decide between either saving the Cursed planet under attack or stop Arthur from killing the other Dragon tier beast."

"I think you know what the right choice is."

The problem was, Quinn really didn't know what the right choice was at the moment. The tenth family wasn't in any immediate danger, but it sounded like Arthur's revenge was taking its toll on the entire vampire settlement, not just Bryce and the others. The Punisher seemed to no longer care about the means for achieving his goal.

While in the middle of thinking this, a system message had appeared.

[Hostility has been detected in the fourteenth castle]

[The fourteenth castle is in danger]

With a lack of answer, Sam knew Quinn's struggle, and thought he needed to give Quinn a push.

"Quinn, I think only you can help the vampire settlements. Since that's the case, me and the others will go help out Helen and the others at the Cursed faction. We will fight and hold the Dalki back for as long as we can. Go help the others while we wait."

It was a tough choice, but Quinn needed to believe in the other cursed faction members.

"Alright. I'll go to the Vampire World then. I have a way to get there. I might not be able to use my Shadow travel, and I might be a little late, but I'll be there to stop Arthur!"

*****

# Chapter 1347 - Back To A Baby
Inside Arthur's throne room, the group was getting ready to move out when the message was heard on Leo's mask. It was heard by everyone in the room since they had enhanced hearing and that included the likes of the second leader.

"Oh, it looks like your little family might be in trouble and needs your help. Although, I believe we had an agreement first." Tempus said. "Don't tell me you're planning to leave after getting that message?"

Too many things were happening at once for Leo to make an accurate decision on the spot. For one, there were those in the castle, and now he could see that they were moving the bodies, placing them on some strange device in the library.

There was then the annoying leader, who was trying to summon the original King from the Tomb, and now his family seemed to be calling for some type of help. The truth was, that the family wasn't in urgent need of Leo, but they wanted to ask Leo what was going on, on his end, and if they had seen Fex and Linda before letting Quinn make his decision.

However, without the chance to talk to them Leo was unaware of that.

"No, let's head to the library quickly. We're in a rush." Leo answered, walking out the door, and the two women quickly followed behind.

Tempus noticed that as the group got closer to the library two people in particular had slowed down. He found it strange, for he had recently come up through all the floors and knew that there was no one on this floor when he had arrived.

He also noticed that one of the masked kept looking at the other two for confirmation.

'Are the other two able to sense something? Something that not even my vampire senses can sense? That is certainly interesting.' Tempus noted.

Entering the library, Silver caught on that they weren't there to look for a book to help out Tempus but it was because of another reason. Entering the room it was filled with around ten Royal guards.

Two stationed on the bottom floor, who could hear that the others had entered.

'This is bad, each Royal guard has the strength on the level of a Vampire knight, and there are ten of them. What are they doing here… could it be?' Frozen in her thought, Silver was too slow to act, but Leo and Erin were not, both quickly heading out.

However, they weren't easy opponents. The Royal guard were able to react by firing off a red slash of aura. Leo had an easy time avoiding it, ducking before the aura came his way, then getting in position, he avoided a punch and got right up behind the Royal guard using the back of his sword to knock him out. It was quick, strong and had Qi energy infused into it.

'They certainly are skilful, it looks like I made the right decision not to fight them.' Tempus thought, but he could see that the single attack had already caught the attention of the other Royal guards on the other floors.

Erin had used the suppression chains to try and silence her enemy, wrapping it around their head, but midway she had learned they had been caught and because of this. She decided to wrap one of the other chains around the vampire's legs, and swung him, hurling it towards the other floors.

She had succeeded but the only problem was the Royal guard was able to make a recovery, as he spun and landed perfectly fine on the second floor. Seeing this, Erin kissed her teeth tutting.

"These aren't your average vampires. Going easy on them isn't an option, not unless you're as skilled as that person." Tempus chuckled looking towards the masked Leo. For some reason, this comment rubbed Erin the wrong way. She felt like the Original insinuated that she was below him.

Hearing the commotion, rushing out from the pit room, was Kyle Dawn. He ran to the balcony and could see the others down below.

"Tempus, what the hell are you doing here?! The King hasn't granted you permission to come here!" Kyle shouted.

"Do you think that really matters at this point?" Tempus shrugged.

One of the Royal guards jumped from the balcony and was too eager to charge in. Silver was thinking of helping, but Leo grabbed her before she could. The Blind Swordsman wanted to see something, just exactly how strong was this original or what could they exactly do.

The Royal guard had used Blood hardening covering both his hands and was pinning them together as it rushed towards Tempus, but the second family leader just gave a yawn as if the whole thing was just tiring.

"Did you not see the countless bodies of the other Royal guards from the first floor? I didn't realise that they started to allow anyone into the Royal guards." The second the guard got too close before he even could attack, Tempus had knocked both of his fists from above and suddenly the guard's hands were planted into the ground.

The guard tried to get up quickly but before he could, Tempus had already stepped on the guard's back and pushed him into the ground further.

"Whatever happened to respecting your seniors? You know what, I think everyone should learn a lesson for attacking an Original, what do you say?" Tempus asked, not waiting for an answer.

Watching everything going on, Silver also was trying to gauge the Original's strength, yet it was incredibly hard for her to do. It was clear he was stronger than a typical Vampire knight, and it didn't seem like he would struggle against most leaders, but how would he fare against the King?

Tempus picked up the Royal guard from the floor, but something strange was happening as the Original placed his other hand on his back. It looked like his body was shrinking in front of their very eyes. The wrinkles on the guard's face were disappearing and the appearance of the person was getting younger.

'What is going on, is it…the second family's ability, but I've never heard of it being so strong! Is he actually reversing his age!' Silver thought seeing this.

Eventually, the former Royal guard turned into a crying baby and only then did Tempus let go of him, gently placing him on the floor.

"You should thank me, you'll now get to experience life once again as a newborn." A smile was on his face, proud of his work, while all the other guards were now frightened to move.

Even Kyle was worried about what this would mean for them now. "Tempus, have you lost your mind? Stop interfering and I promise to not mention this to the King. You know what Bryce needs these people for. He's our only chance to stop Arthur. You can stay here, just let us do as we wish!"

As someone who wanted to do everything the easiest way possible, Tempus liked this suggestion.

"It's a deal." He shouted.

For Silver and the others they knew that they couldn't let Kyle finish what he was doing, and this was when the deal needed to be cut off.

Silver was ready to act, but once again someone stopped her. She felt something grabbing her around the back of her neck, and Tempus who was a few meters away was now suddenly behind her.

"Ah, ah, ah." Tempus spoke to the other two masked, who had their weapons pointed towards him. "I might not know who you are, but it's clear that you guys seem to care for each other far more than your average vampire does. On top of that, you tricked me."

"You brought me to this place knowing that they were here. I can tell that you two have some type of ability that allows you to sense them or see them. If you're lying about that, then perhaps the two of you are lying about where the tomb is as well."

Pressing his hand against Silver's back, slowly the same thing that happened to the other guard started to happen to her. Silver's appearance started to change, and her body sunk down, until she was just in her top that now covered her entire body.

"Wait." Leo shouted. "Stop! Turn her back and we'll tell you what you want to know. We'll tell you the location of the tomb!"

*****

# Chapter 1348 - The Families Shame
The fighting at each of the castles had almost come to an end and unlike during the first attack, the vampires had been prepared this time, leading to a decrease in the number of their losses. However, this still left the families with one worry in their mind.

After this, just what exactly should they do next? Having received the message from Jill, all the vampires were at a loss. The leaders didn't know who to turn to.The King had betrayed them, the one person that they should have all trusted, the one that they relied on in tough times and the one that they had voted into that position.

Still, they were also having trouble against Arthur in these times. Was it really the time for them to dethrone Bryce? After dealing with the invaders, the leaders had decided to do something about this question on their mind.

A strange phenomena occurred next. All of the surviving leaders had collectively decided to head to a certain castle. There was no communication between them. It was something they knew they had to do. All had headed towards the first castle and were waiting outside of the first family castle.

The castle where Bryce was originally from. They were there to demand answers and to confirm whether what they had heard was true. Being strict creatures of tradition, they felt like they were unable to storm the King's castle, so this was the next best thing in their minds.

At the moment, certain leaders had gathered. Jin Talon, Sunny Kent, Jake Muscat, David Scutter and Lee Sanguines. They were the leaders of the 4th, 5th, 6th, 11th and 13th families. The other families hadn't decided to come, or simply had no one that could come at the moment.

When meeting with each other, the leaders exchanged their opinions on the matter.

"It seems that we all got that message from Jill. I still can't believe it, has the King really been sacrificing his own kind?" David asked.

Muka was the first to nod.

"We have been looking into this matter, and it all adds up. If we look at the eighth castle there are no longer any crystals on the outside that are lighting up. Her message must have gotten interrupted by Bryce killing her. I'll be honest, we suspect that certain vampires have been helping him."

"The ones…that Arthur has been killing." Jake said, having figured it out. "I already knew. When the other leaders were getting eliminated, I remember that they were ones who had traveled with my brother a long time ago!"

"With my brother gone, I was left in charge of the family for the meantime, of course. Vadeen Muscat was already dead so Arthur was unable to go after him, but I had no idea that Bryce was doing this. Why would he be doing this, and where is he right now? I didn't see him in the pooling area."

"That's why we are here." Jin stated the obvious. "We need to get some answers, and we need him to be honest. Bryce won't tell us the truth, but there is someone else who should know the truth at this very place."

Not wasting time, Jin got his shield ready, tapping the top of it, making the small blades shoot out from the inside. The blades went around the entire shield dripping with blood. Then throwing it out, it approached the gate. All of the castles had closed their inner castle gates for fear of an attack and the first family wasn't an exception to this.

The only thing they didn't suspect was that there would be an attack from one of the other families. The shield started to spin, throwing out the blood against the wall and in seconds multiple explosions went off. When the explosions stopped the wall could be seen partially destroyed.

"What is going on? Oh no, are we under another attack?!"

"We just managed to get rid of the Dalki and Masked! Is this the Punisher?"

They looked towards the entrance, and could see the other leaders walking through the doors of the inner area. The vampires there were at a loss of what to do, for they too had heard the message that had been broadcasted to them all.

In the end, they decided to do the only thing they could do. They bowed their heads in shame towards the leaders. They kept their heads down, their bodies at a 90 degree angle never lifting it up. While the leaders walked through.

Even the vampires that were injured remained still, letting their wounds bleed out. The vampires were simply embarrassed at what their former leader had done, their current King. They didn't need an explanation as to why the other leaders were here.

In the end, they didn't even need to reach the castle for there were two people who they wanted to speak to were waiting for them.

"Kazz, Nicu." Sunny called out to them. "Both of you have been under your father for a long time. Kazz as his trusted Vampire knight, and Nicu as the son he was raising to take over his leader position.

"I'm sure you are aware why we are here. We wish for you to tell us now what your father has done. Please comply, else we will have to storm the castle and look for evidence on our way. The worst case, we will lock you up until we can bring in the King himself."

"You idiots!" Nicu shouted, stepping forward. "My father would never-"

Before Nicu could say much more, Kazz fell to her knees with her face full of tears.

"I never thought…I never thought……he was doing the wrong thing. He wouldn't have done this…he wouldn't have if it wasn't for Arthur."

There were some of the leaders that still had their doubts whether or not Bryce was behind such a thing, but this confirmed in their minds that the King was unfit to lead.

"Will you tell us why he was sacrificing members of our family? Their families will want to know whether their death at least had some meaning to it…" Muka requested.

"My father has always stayed true to his word…he has done everything for the sake of protecting…no he wasn't protecting us, everything he has done was for the sake of getting rid of all those with the Shadow power. I knew this, and he had done so using underhand methods that had damaged the settlement he promised to protect." When speaking, Kazz was biting her lip. She didn't even seem to realise that she was bleeding.

Ironically, the person who had pounded into her how important it was to follow the rules had been none other than her own father. It was because of that that she knew how much he had broken them as well. After that, she confessed everything she knew to the leader, about what exactly the King had done with those that he had taken from the other families, and their eyes winded as they heard the tale.

Some of them felt bad, that they hadn't noticed it even though it had been happening right underneath their noses. However there was one thing Kazz didn't know, and that was what he had done to the bodies of the deceased.

Due to this, they had decided to enter the castle, and Kazz led the way, leaving Nicu in charge of all those on the inner castle ground area.

It was the worst day in history for the first family.

——

Bryce, himself, had finally arrived at the fourteenth castle. He entered the inner castle area, which was filled with buildings that had been abandoned for years, yet he didn't care. Wasting no time he started destroying everything around him.

The blood from the pooling area was brought along with him, and covering his arms, there were now two large vortexes of blood constantly spinning in place. As Bryce stood in the centre. He looked towards the castle.

"Arhur show yourself! I will destroy every single thing in this place until you do!" Bryce shouted, as he let out the large blood vortexes on either side, making them grow ten times in size. They began ripping the houses around them in seconds. It was as if thousands of Blood swipes were hitting the buildings again and again and they were unable to survive. Eventually, both of the vortexes had met up with each other and the blood had disappeared .

However, along with it, so had all of the houses in the fourteenth's castle inner area, now only the castle remained. Chuckling at the site, Bryce was over the moon, because the person he had been waiting for had arrived.

"You were meant to be the last person on my list." Arthur stated, standing in front of the castle, the shadow waving behind his back. "I see that it was wrong to leave you for this long. It's time for you to be gone from this world."

"You're taking the words out of my mouth!" Bryce shouted back.

The battle between the two strongest vampires was to begin, and the whole vampire settlement could feel what was about to occur.

# Chapter 1349 - Blood Swords
Arthur could see that the blood was moving from the other castles and heading towards Bryce from a distance. It was all of the blood spilt from the vampires, the masked and the Dalki in the area. Controlling more blood was troublesome, and even now, Bryce had plenty of blood to play with.

This was apparent by how much destruction he had caused with just the amount of blood he had now. This was why Arthur decided to not hold back. Quickly using the shadow equip skill, his blood armour was shown, and Arthur held his great sword in his hand.

At the same time, the large shadow started to form on his back, giving him two gigantic wings made from shadow. On Bryce's side, he had formed the ten large swords of blood that were hovering in the air, and it was time for the clash to begin.

The largest of the blood blades was sent out first. This was the blade that continued Bryce's true sword inside as well.

Seeing this, Arthur moved his large shadow wing to block the attack. The two hit, sending out waves of energy in all directions. Pulses could be seen due to how much power was in both of these objects. The sword stayed hovering for a few seconds.

Regardless, the sword also could be seen being moved from the shadow easily and going to attack again. It was hard to tell if the effect of the shadow slowing down objects was working on the blood sword or not, for how quick it could move even after touching the shadow.

Controlling them all, Bryce tried to find a way to attack using all the swords, moving them in different areas looking for an opening. At the same time, the shadow on the wings was reacting to each of the attacks just as fast. Changing shape slightly and being able to move freely.

Eventually, Bryce split one of the blood swords into two at the right moment and went straight for Arthur's head. Before it could reach him, Arthur was able to swing his sword down, slashing it directly in half.

"Did you forget that I was once classed as one of the greatest swordsmen in human history, and I had even more time than you to polish my skills," Arthur said.

Now that his little warm-up was over, it was time for him to attack.

————

Leo and the others had left the library in the king's castle and were slowly heading through the floors. While Tempus still had a hold on Silver. Although Leo had requested that Silver be changed back to her form before he would help her, he had a feeling that Tempus was not the type to comply.

In almost an instant, he started to make it so Silver was even younger, and now she was about the size of a five-year-old girl. Thankfully the large robe they were wearing was long enough to cover everything on their body. Still, now that she was far smaller, her mask had fallen off, revealing her face.

It was hard for anyone, including Tempus, who wasn't even alive back then, to know who this cute little girl was. It was almost impossible to match it up with the Silver that they knew of.

"Why are we walking?" Tempus asked. "Surely your ability can scan this whole castle. You should know where the tomb is?"

"My ability doesn't work like that." Leo lied. "I'm guessing you noticed me using it before, but it has a short range and is less accurate. Depending on the situation, it is harder for me to see as well. Fast movements can also cause problems.

"I assure you, I don't want anything to happen to my fellow colleagues, and you know that my castle is in trouble, so I would not be taking this lightly."

Of course, everything that Leo said was a lie, and he and Erin already knew where the tomb was. Leo was just trying to buy time, to figure a way out of this without complying with Tempus' order.

The problem was, how would they revert Silver back? It seemed like the only way was to listen and awaken the first king. Perhaps Leo was just delaying the inevitable in the end.

——

Now that the others had left, Kyle Dawn was free to do his duty. The bodies were being piled up on a large type of storage vehicle. The royal guards were helping with the duty, but some of them didn't seem to be enthusiastic about moving the bodies.

"Hurry, we have no time to waste. Can't you feel it? The battle with the king and Arthur has already started." Kyle said.

Still, even with these words, the Royal guards just felt like this was wrong. They had played no part in Bryce's schemes, they knew nothing about this, so they were processing what he had done just as much as any vampire was.

However, their duty, which had been ingrained in them, was taking over, and they were following orders from the Royal knight. Eventually, all of the bodies had been placed on three vehicles, and it was time to move out.

———

Running forward the flying blood blades continued to attack Arthur's back, but they were unable to touch or keep up with him. His large wings of shadow started to expand and grow, chasing after the sword blocking them each time they even came close to him.

Arthur readied his sword and was ready to go straight for Bryce, that was until he could suddenly see ten more blood blades appear, hovering over Bryce's head. For a second, Arthur thought the attack behind him had stopped, but they were still there.

'He's been able to gather more blood, and as time goes on, he will be able to summon more of those blades. With absolute blood control, using my own blood attacks will be ineffective against him, he could even use his powers to stop them, so I will just have to attack the old fashioned way.'

As the swords came towards him, Arthur swung his own blade effortlessly despite its large size, whacking them away and even destroying some of them with such strength. Still, Bryce was able to use the blood again, reforming them into hardened swords the second they were destroyed.

"I see the shadow was something I really didn't have to worry about much at all. Eventually, your time will be up as I gather more power." Bryce said.

"Do you really believe that?" Arthur said as he continued to swing his sword, moving his shadow blocking all twenty of the flying blood blades. Then Arthur took a step forward, not just one, but he continued to step forward, blocking them all.

"Do you not remember the reason why I exist? I am the punisher, and my power is meant to be so great, that even if the king is to break a crime, then I am to punish them as well."

Arthur seemingly ignored some of the blood blades now. There was no need to block all of them, and he let a few of them hit his blood armour. Because when they did, it did absolutely nothing.

Although Arthur couldn't use his sword's abilities from a distance, he could still use them on impact. Finally, getting within range of Bryce. Arthur swung his sword down, and Bryce quickly moved his cane covered in blood to his hand. Lifting it, blocking the blow.

An explosion was set off at the same time from the sword's power, causing Bryce's knees to buckle under the strength, bending slightly.

"You might have better blood control than me. You might be able to do all of this, but it doesn't help you in the strength department, nor make up for your lack of skills!' Arthur shouted, kicking Bryce in the stomach sending him flying through the air.

Arthur quickly followed, swinging his sword hitting Bryce in the stomach and sending him to the ground. The blood swords were trying to keep up, but Arthur's shadow wasn't letting up. He was able to control it at a speed beyond what others had seen before.

Not just that, but with each successful hit, Arthur was getting faster due to one of the abilities contained in the sword. After Bryce had recovered, he was being hit with the great sword, again and again, thrown like a rag doll, each time making his movements faster. Bryce could do nothing but protect his head from the devastating blows.

His armour was what was keeping him alive at the moment, but if he didn't do something, Arthur would only get stronger. Out of rage, the blood armour he was wearing started to light up. Its active skill was activating.

And a flash of red, a great power of aura, was unleashed onto Arthur, who was right next to him. When the flash red disappeared, Bryce could tell that the attacks had stopped, but his opponent had covered his entire body with the shadow wings and was still completely fine.

"You…" Arthur said as he slowly opened his wings. "Even as king and borrowed power are so weak. I can't believe you did that to them. If only I was there!"

However, Bryce hadn't just been doing nothing while suffering abuse from Arthur. Now around him, all the blood had been gathered from the settlement. Hovering above him were over a hundred blood swords.

"You dealt with twenty, but let's see you deal with this!" Bryce said, sending them all out at once.

*****

# Chapter 1350 - Hundred Blood Swords
The hundred Blood swords looked menacing as each of them were pointing towards Arthur. Just ten of the flying swords had been enough to decimate a large group of Dalki, and now the Punisher was facing ten times that number all on his own.

However, despite the situation, Arthur didn't show any signs of hesitation, still willing to go in.

"I have confidence that I will win this fight. I promised myself that I would not fall until I made sure that everyone on my list has been dealt with."

Bryce laughed at this comment.

"We're not so different. Unfortunately, unlike you, I'm not an Original so I wasn't blessed with an immortal body. Why do you think, given my age, I have willingly stayed awake after all this time? I won't lie to you, Arthur, each day my body is in pain, begging me to take the rest it deserves. However, I haven't allowed it to! Just like you, the only thing that keeps me moving forward is my desire to get my revenge on ALL OF YOU PUNISHERS!!!"

The hundred Blood swords were unleashed. Arthur looked like a small dot in comparison, as he ran toward them. It looked like a human who was about to be showered on by rain. It would be impossible to block every single one of them even with his shadow.

"I learned something interesting watching that boy, these wings are fancy and nice, but they're not practical enough." Arthur spoke, as both the wings on his back started to form in his left hand. Instead of holding the swords with both hands, he had switched to solely his predominant one.

Meanwhile his shadow looked to have almost condensed into a shield made of shadows. Although Arthur could move his shadow faster than other people with the said ability, against hundred swords he knew his shadow wouldn't be able to move fast enough which was why he opted to hold it in place.

As the swords came forward, the Punisher was able to move his hand blocking each of the strikes, controlling the shadow expanding it bit by bit even in its shield form, while also hitting away the swords. Arthur also wasn't holding back as he used the sword's powers to blast away as many as the Blood swords as possible.

It was an amazing sight to behold, something worthy of being immortalised into a painting. The ancient vampire blocked dozens of them, yet he was unable to fend them all off. Still, being as skilled as he was, he made sure to limit it so that the majority that breached his defenses only managed to give him surface wounds or bounce off against his armour.

"Even if you had a thousand swords, I would still get through them all!" Arthur declared, as he recklessly started to move forward towards Bryce. Standing still, he had managed to avoid major injuries, but on the move such a task wasn't that easy. The closer he got to the Vampire King the deeper the cuts he received from the Blood swords. However, he didn't care, making sure to avoid just the ones that would be fatal.

"Idiotic." Bryce scoffed, as he formed ten more Blood swords, sending them Arthur's way, hoping to finish him off before he could close the distance completely. Arthur continued to attack and continued to use the explosive powers of the sword. He no longer had the ability of the twelfth family, as it had been a while since he had hit Bryce, but he was still fast enough to deal with all the attacks.

'How is he still able to use his Blood weapon's powers?' Bryce tried to figure out what he might have overlooked. The King had been certain that he would have had a great advantage over the Punisher in this fight. Absolute blood control should have meant that as long as his opponent was a vampire that it should be near impossible for them to use Blood powers or Blood weapons, making it so that he would only have to deal with the other's shadow ability and physical abilities, yet somehow Arthur was still able to activate his weapon.

'The only thing I can think of is that damned armour. It must have some type of ability that still allows him to use his weapon. Well no matter, it seems he is still having trouble with-'

Bryce stopped his thought there, as he noticed that even with the increased number of swords, Arthur was inching his way forward. He continued to swing his sword at the blood swords, narrowly avoiding attacks and blocking them with his shield.

To Arthur his current situation was reminiscent to the olden days when he had participated directly on the battlefield where a fatal blow could come from anywhere. It had been a long time since he had been reminded of when he had still been human.

It was then unexpectedly, when Arthur had come within ten meters of Bryce, he decided to hurl his sword in the air, throwing it like a spear.

The Blood swords tried to stop it, but the sword went through them destroying them as they went past. While Arthur had dropped his Shadow shield allowing it to protect him for a few seconds.

'Any tricks with the shadow I know won't work on this man. Neither the Shadow path, nor the Shadow jump redirect, but he knows nothing about what I have been through!'

It was then that Bryce had to make a quick decision, half of the swords he decided to drop to the ground in order to create a wall of blood that would stop the sword. As the sword hit the wall it was stopped in its tracks, but to Arthur this didn't matter. He had never expected for things to finish this easily. He pulled on something that looked almost invisible and the sword started to come back towards him.

At first, Bryce thought that it might have been blood control, but soon realised that this was the ability of the thirteenth family. The sword was attached to a piece of string, allowing for it to come back to Arthur's hand, but it never did return.

Now that the number of Blood swords had lessened, Arthur began his attack, swinging the sword from outward in a different direction. It was now Bryce's turn to go on the defensive, preventing his enemy from killing him.

"You know, when I was but a small boy, I actually looked up to your kind. However, you have proven that you have no shame!" Bryce stated. "You killed an innocent man. I won't deny my own crime, but my grandfather had never attacked your people. He would never do anything like that! You say you punish people for their crimes, but who was supposed to punish you? Why didn't you deserve to be punished for killing an innocent man?!"

The two were still fighting while in the middle of conversing, Arthur blocking parts of the flying sword with his shadow shield while swinging his sword with his other hand, and similarly Bryce was blocking attacks with his blood while also controlling the swords.

"Is that the reason why you started your expedition?!" Arthur questioned him. "I may have been the one who dealt out the punishment, but it was still the council who decided against your grandfather. I was not the single person who had decided for or against the decision!"

"That may be true, but it doesn't change that you were the very person that didn't try to look deeper into the truth! At the end of the day, you were the very person who killed him in front of everyone! I don't care if history remembers me as a tyrant, as long as nobody else will have to go through the pain I did!" Bryce shouted.

"That is pathetic!" Arthur denounced his actions. "If you did all of that because someone innocent got punished, why did you go after them? Why did you go after the others? Even now, I haven't chosen to blame the whole vampire settlement, yet instead of going after me personally, you went after the people I cared about! Just because you couldn't find me, you took out your petty revenge on innocent people! How does this make you any better than me then?!"

Each one delivering more power into their strikes and the pulses of energy sent form each one had even moved the rubble around them further and further away off to the side, but finally there was something that was soon to turn the tide.

'Arthur, he is far stronger than I imagined. If I was just a vampire leader I would have never been able to get my revenge. I became King to overpower him, yet that still doesn't seem to have been enough, but it seems like the Gods are on my side. Because even they want me to win this battle!'

"Your Majesty! I have arrived!" Kyle shouted and the three vehicles were there just outside the inner castle area.

It was time for Bryce to use the crystal. Pulling it out, it was filled with black shadows, all of the Shadow power he himself had gathered, and he was now going to use Arthur's own power against him.

*****

# Chapter 1351 - A True Infected
The fight between Arthur and Bryce was at a standstill, with both sides attacking and not one side being able to best the other in strength or find an opening. Still, Arthur believed he had the edge for a few reasons.

His sword still had plenty of power, more so unlimited. He could still use all of his abilities due to the effects of the blood armour he was wearing. His blood armour special effect was to allow him to infuse blood to whatever he was touching. It was an ideal matchup to his weapon, allowing him to use all its abilities whenever he wished. Unless Bryce could destroy the Armour, there was no way for him to stop using the abilities of the sword.

The good thing about it, was it also allowed him to use his blood weapon when fighting against non-human opponents. Although even then, it didn't help him out in a particular situation.

Although Bryce could control all blood, he could not control this, and eventually, even with the absolute blood control, its power would take its toll on one's body. This was what Arthur was waiting for.

Yet, in the middle of the fight, Arthur could feel something was happening, Bryce still was continuing to attack hard, but his shadow seemed to be reacting strangely.

'Is there another shadow user nearby? Is that why my shadow is reacting in a weird way?' Arthur thought, still holding onto the shadow shield. 'No, this feels different. My shadow feels like it almost wants to go over to where he is rather than come to where I am.'

-----

Kyle had done his duty, and there was no need for him to get close to the battle. Even as a Royal Knight, he was worried getting caught up in either of their attacks would finish him off in a single hit. Thankfully the vehicles he could set to an auto travel feature, sending them into the inner castle area.

Arthur, seeing the vehicles approaching from a distance, wondered what was going on. He could see that they were carrying bodies, dead bodies.

'What is he up to?' Arthur thought. The scene of the dead bodies just angered Arthur more, and he wondered if Bryce was trying to use them in some way to taunt him, but that felt silly. Bryce was someone who would do anything for his goal but wasn't a fool to think this would help beat the punisher.

"I bet even you didn't know about your shadows' full capabilities or the true origins of its power," Bryce said. "Let's see how you deal when your own power is used against you."

From the crystal, shadows started to escape and travelled to the bodies. Arthur, seeing the familiar shadow, was stunned for a few seconds. He had no clue how Bryce was able to do such a thing, nor did he understand, but seeing shadow, he thought naturally he would be able to take it for himself and control it, or at least intercept it.

The shield form had done him well so far, but with half the amount of flying swords attacking him, he could use the shadow as he did before. The condensed shadows changed, and now Arthur was sending his own shadow out to intercept what he could see going after the vehicles.

Before the two of them touched, against Arthur's will, his shadow started to move away and was heading directly to where Bryce was.

"Haha, excellent!" Bryce started to smile. "I thought there was a chance that it wouldn't actually work against your shadow, but it seems like it does."

Arthur, seeing what was happening, wanted to recall his shadow, and that he did, but he was only able to recall a part of it. Nearly half of the shadow that he had sent out looked to be in some type of trance, floating and continuing to move towards the king.

That's when Arthur could see it. There was something in Bryce's hand. The crystal was slightly dark in colour, and the shadow soon went into the crystal, making the colour darker than it once was before.

Arthur could feel that part of his shadow was lost and no longer in his control.

'What is that crystal, and why is it able to absorb my shadow?' Arthur looked at it confused. It was worrying. He didn't know if it was a one-off or not, but he would have to try and win this entire fight without using his shadow.

With absolute blood power, not allowing him to use his blood attacks, and now this. Arthur would only be able to rely on his sword skills and power. The fight was getting harder by the second, and that wasn't the end of it.

The shadow that had escaped from the crystal had now entered the bodies of the dead. It looked as if the shadow power itself was infusing with their bodies. They were becoming covered in shadow from head to toe, constantly shifting.

And then, they started to move. They got up from the pile, still with shadows constantly moving around, and walked towards the battle. This continued to happen until there were now twenty people covered in shadow.

'My shadow powers have never been able to do something like this before. Is he reanimating the dead with them?' Arthur thought.

Arthur was focused more on the Crystal in Bryce's hand, he needed to get it for himself or somehow destroy it. Thinking this, Arthur placed his sword on the ground, and certain areas on the floor started to light up.

He had set up his traps and just needed Bryce to walk into them. He then swung his sword, attempting to hit Bryce. Widely swinging it with the string and using the explosive ability at the same time. Even though Bryce had blocked the attack with his blood, the sheer power of the explosive was nearly getting through his blood wall now

It was moving Bryce ever so slightly from side to side, until the light shone beneath his feet. Bryce had stepped into one of the traps freezing his body for a few seconds.

It was the perfect chance to hit Bryce cleanly.

Arthur had been using around 90 percent of his strength in each attack so far. Still, knowing that Bryce probably had more, Arthur didn't want to tire himself out for unexpected situations like now.

'Now I have to use everything I have to shatter that crystal!' Arthur once again hurled the sword like a spear. It went faster than it did before, and the blood wall had come to protect Bryce.

The wall was successful in arriving in time but not successful in stopping the sword. It went through it as if it crashed through a wave splitting the blood to either side.

Yet, Bryce wasn't worried because all twenty of those with the shadow bodies lifted their hand, and just like Arthur, what looked like a wall now made of shadows had appeared.

'They can…control the shadow…' Arthur realised. The second his blade touched the shadow, he realised that it worked just like his.

He pulled the sword away via the string with strength, attaching it back to his hand, and was left even more perplexed as to how to get out of his situation.

Now, he couldn't use shadow or blood skills, and he was fighting against his own powers.

It was at that moment that the other leaders had arrived from the first castle.

They decided to stay quite far back as they watched the spectacle and could see the dead bodies, the bodies being used in the way they were.

"This was Bryce plan. How is he able to do this?" Sunny wondered.

"I'm not sure," Jin replied. "However, it seems like he might have Arthur pushed up in a corner."

As they watched this scene, the question on everyone's mind was, who should they try to help. Who was the villain? Would Arthur continue to attack those in the vampire settlement with the Dalki after this, or would Bryce descend further into madness, refusing to give up the throne?

Perhaps, it might have been a situation where none of them deserved to live. What the leaders didn't know was that the situation was about to become more dire, and far more complex. For at the king's castle, Leo had made a decision.

With no way out and wishing to save Silver's life, he had led Tempus to the first king's tomb. They stood on the underground floor in a certain spot. There was nothing to show that the first king was buried here, but Tempus destroying the ground where they were could see the round chamber. The specially designed tombs for those to go to sleep.

"Finally, finally!" Tempus said with excitement. "It's been a long time. It's finally time for you to take back what was always yours, my friend." Tempus said.

*****

# Chapter 1352 - Interruption
Due to the situation, the leaders were in. In the end, they decided to help neither side. Joining one side at the moment wouldn't guarantee that side would win. Although it looked like the Punisher was cornered, they thought that he would still be able to at least harm Bryce or tire him out somehow.

The best course of action for them would be to wait for a winner out of the two and then for them to act because right now, neither one of the two were good for the vampire settlement.

Now that Arthur was aware that those that were covered in the shadow could use his powers, he decided to go for a different approach. Arthur needed to take out those with the shadow power.

"You are already dead, so there is no guilt inside me when I do this!" Arthur thought as he charged in towards one of those with the shadow powers. Arthur swung his blade, hitting the shadow person from the head down to his feet. The flying Blood blades were still following from behind.

A quick slash was made, And Arthur went on to move to the next one, but he realised something.

'I felt like I hit nothing. What is going on?' Turning his head, Arthur could see that the figure he had just attacked, nothing had happened. It was still standing there. Arthur had no time to slow down. Otherwise, the blood swords would eventually hit him.

When reaching the next person covered in shadows, he decided to do a vertical slash instead, hoping to cut the body in half. This time he paid closer attention. He could see his sword going through the body. He could feel it slicing the body, but just as quickly as he went through it, the shadow was almost reattaching the parts and bringing them back together again.

'I…I can't hurt them… it's like I'm just hitting a body made of shadow's.' Arthur didn't understand these shadow beings, and he didn't have time to figure it out. Turning around, ten blades went to stab him at once.

Moving the sword, he tilted it so the flat side could block the attack, all ten points of the blades hit at once, but the force was great, causing him to be lifted in the air by its power. It was a bit close, but Arthur had no choice but to activate the explosion power.

A loud bang was made, and the swords were destroyed. Still, Arthur had also suffered from some of the attack made by his own sword. His face was hurt and partly burnt, and for some reason, it wasn't healing either.

"Haha, you really are a fool", Bryce said. "You have a gifted body that can heal you from an attack like this, but I guess for more serious wounds, even you require blood. When was the last time you had consumed blood? If you don't, you will soon die." Bryce said.

Knowing there was nothing else Arthur could do, he decided to go forward to Bryce once again.

"So what I can't use the shadow, so what I can't use blood powers. All I need is a sword in my hand to take you down!" Arthur shouted.

He covered the distance in mere seconds and thrust his sword forward. A shadow appeared attempting to block his attack, and Arthur spun his body using the sword as weight skidded himself across the floor and, moving to Bryce's side. It was open, and the shadow was unable to keep up.

Arthur thrust to hit Bryce successfully on his side. The blood blades followed and stabbed Arthur from behind. Most of them had hit his armour, but one had managed to hit him just underneath the armpit, a gap in his armour.

Still, Arthur pushing through and ignoring the hit continued with the thrust, successfully hitting Bryce, and activated the explosion power again, increasing the power of the hit and sending him across the field.

'That was a bad hit.' Arthur thought as he could feel his blood trickling from under his arm. 'But I got a hit off as well. It might have just hit the armour, but now the twelfth family ability is activated, and I have gained extra speed. It was worth it, and I need to end this now!'

Arthur had a theory, and he wanted to test it out. Running after Bryce, the blood blades stood in his way, but Arthur decided to summon his shadow once more, covering himself. It blocked the blood blade's attacks and Arthur continued to dash forward, the shadow slowly trailed once again. Although following the direction Arthur was going in, it wasn't following him, but going to where Bryce was currently present.

This was because the shadow is on longer Arthur's.

Once again. Arthur went to attack from the front, but the shadow from the other twenty were summoned. With his speed, he thrust his sword and then moved to the side to repeat the same attack as last time, successfully hitting Bryce once again from behind. Another explosion hit off, and Arthur had gained even more speed.

Bryce now was bleeding from his mouth, having been hit by two big blows. His armour was unable to defend from the power of the explosion.

'How…I have the power of the shadow…and the absolute blood powers, and he is still able to hurt me!' Bryce was angered, but the shadow from Arthur soon entered the crystal in his hand.

Arthur had figured it out. All of Bryce's strengths were in a way, his weaknesses as well. The crystal that could stop Arthur from using his shadow and was controlling the others needed to be protected. Meaning the blood wall couldn't be moved to defend himself as much anymore.

At the same time, it wasn't impossible for Arthur to use his shadow. Just every time he did, the shadow would no longer be for him to use again. It was more of a one time use. In emergency situations, he could still block the attack.

This was why Arthur was successfully able to attack Bryce, despite all of his advantages.

'If you had fought me without all these things, it would have been a more interesting fight. This is what happens when you use borrowed power.' Arthur thought.

Repeating the same thing again. Hitting Bryce for the third time. It was getting easier since Arthur was getting faster after each successful hit.

"What are we watching right now? How was Arthur able to turn the tables around?" Jake asked.

"I heard that the leader of the Punishers was a great fighter in tactics and even more," Muka said. "He was someone that the vampires even feared when humans had no powers. He was able to take on mystical beings and had even killed a few stray vampires before he had been turned. That was the type of person they had turned into a vampire.

"That person had 1000s and 1000s of years to hone his skills, and that is what we are witnessing right now. While Bryce had been obsessed with absolute blood control. Bryce also thought that if he could stop Arthur from using his shadow, he could somehow win, yet this is the result in the end."

Seeing how things were playing out, the shadow from the crystal started to lead again, heading to more bodies, and at that time, more of the shadow people were being made. The numbers almost doubled from before.

Bryce had decided on giving up on the blood being used as a defensive measure. Instead, the new shadow users stood between him and Arthur. At that moment, before Arthur could dash in, more than a hundred blood swords had returned, and they surrounded Arthur like a chamber.

"This will be your fall!" Bryce shouted, moving all of the swords at once towards Arthur.

"Did you not learn anything!" Arthur shouted, using his shadow again to block the strikes from the swords, and charged straight forward, holding his sword with both hands. He was ready to swing it out with great speed. At the same time, Bryce had his cane sword held back in his hand.

The blood vortex he had summoned from before was now around his sword, and Bryce charged forward as well. The two were ready for a big clash.

Until a certain individual had dropped out from the sky, landing in the middle of them both, his head was down, making it hard to see who it was. Neither cared for this intruder and had planned to deliver thier attacks regardless.

"Who is that, who jumped in the middle of that madness!" Jin called out.

The leaders looked at each other to see if one of them had intervened, but it was neither of them. They all thought that the intruder was to perish. Even if a leader jumped between those two attacks, they would fall.

The intruder stomped down on both of his feet, and before they could reach him or each other, he threw his fists out in both directions. A large invisible force had hit Arthur, he didn't even see what had hit him, but it caused him to fall on his back. At the same time, the blast in the other direction seemed to cut through the blood on Bryce's sword, hitting it and making the old vampire fall as well.

Leaving only one person standing, raising his head.

"Stop this!"

"That's…the tenth leader!" Jin called out.

*****

# Chapter 1353 - No Point Fighting
The other leaders were beyond shocked to see the tenth leader of all people suddenly appear in the middle of the fight between King Bryce and the Punisher Arthur. Where had he come from? How did he know about this fight? And most importantly, what had he just done to knock both of these supreme beings off their feet?

Nobody doubted his strength, after all he had been the one who had defeated the previous Queen. Although not crowned for long, Cindy had learned the Absolute blood control skill and had even stolen the Blood armour, yet he had still somehow been able to beat her.

Nevertheless, this fight was a tier above that.

Unlike his predecessor, Bryce had had ample time to familiarise himself with the King's exclusive skill. What's more, he hadn't been considered the strongest leader out of all of them despite his advanced age for nothing. Then there was Arthur, a being that none of them understood, yet all feared no matter how strong they got.

"What did he use against them? I didn't see anything come out of his hands?" Sunny asked, watching carefully.

Unfortunately, nobody else had been able to make it out, because it was something none of the vampires had seen before. Quinn had used the third stage of Qi. He had tested it out on the space beings, and had only recently come across it, but it was also the only thing he had believed would be able to surprise the two of them on initial impact.

Any blood attack they would have simply avoided, his shadow abilities would have fared no better,

yet they couldn't block an attack they were unable to see. It turned out that it had worked far better than even Quinn had anticipated.

A short while later, after the tenth leader had landed on the ground, the ship could be seen crashing off in the distance. Now it made sense to them why Quinn had suddenly appeared out of the sky.

Of course, during Quinn's flight all he had been doing was preparing himself, watching out for any situation where he might be needed. The second his eyes latched onto Arthur, he had decided to descend.

'I have to…I have to speak to them all…all of this fighting is pointless.' Quinn thought to himself.

"Listen!" Quinn shouted, while the two were still getting off the floor. "Stop fighting, neither one of you should have a real reason to fight against each other."

The second Bryce saw who it was, his anger wasn't unsettled.

'How did this boy even get here? Even as a King he dares defy me!!!' Bryce was practically fuming.

Still, due to what had just happened moments ago, the vampire wasn't going to act until he knew how Quinn had done it. The tenth leader always seemed to have tricks up his sleeve and there was a chance what had just happened was the same.

Bryce could feel his insides hurt from the strange force, and his body wasn't healing well from it. Nevertheless, it didn't stop him from holding back his tongue.

"How dare you?!" Bryce questioned him. "You ignored an official order from your King himself and what's more you tried to harm me? Do you know the consequences your actions will have?"

"Shut up!" Quinn yelled back, immediately directing it at Bryce. "You aren't fit to be King, not that I ever regarded you as one. You've attacked the fourteenth castle, and I already know what you have been doing to all those missing people from the other families!"

While on his way here, Paul hadn't stopped updating Sam on the situation, who in turn would relay that information to Quinn as well.

"Both of you need to hear the truth! Once you realise how stupid this whole thing is, hopefully you will end this madness!" Quinn pleaded.

Arthur for one, decided to not attack and let the boy speak.

"I shall listen to you, Quinn. I owe you that much at least, though I doubt it will change anything." Arthur said and stared at Bryce. His gaze made it clear that he would resume the fight if the other vampire wouldn't follow suit. The King didn't mind the chance to have a breather, especially since it would grant him time to get rid of the strange energy.

Bryce just scoffed, but he didn't give off any signs that he would attack. Knowing him this was the best he could get. Not wanting to waste any time, Quinn started to speak, hoping it might quell the situation somehow.

"Look, I understand Bryce, I know about your past! I saw the room and I know what really happened to the knights." Quinn began.

Suddenly, Bryce became far more intrigued to hear what the tenth leader had to say.

"The Boneclaw, Richard Eno's old familiar, is now with me. I saw what really happened. I know your grandfather was the person who was against the Punishers. So it was easy for them to put the blame on him, but he wasn't the one that harmed them. The one that harmed them is the familiar that is now with me."

When telling his tale, the other leaders were also able to hear, but they could only guess what Quinn was referring to.

"The truth is, Richard Eno, the first king, was the one that had ordered the attack on Arthur's knights. He did so hoping that Arthur would take his role more seriously. He needed someone powerful to pin the blame on, so the vampires would believe there was a need for Punishers."

"Don't you understand? The one that orchestrated this entire situation, the one who tricked both of you was none other than Richard Eno, the First King. He is the one behind all of this!" Quinn explained. "Bryce, he caused your grandfather's death, not Arthur! Arthur was just as much a victim in all of this."

"I know!" Bryce suddenly shouted. "Don't you think I didn't know that, but that doesn't change the fact that he and all the vampires still agreed to put them to death! No one stopped anything."

"Even if I said this fact, would anyone believe me, could they bring him back! No, by then everyone was praising the Punisher's existence, and you tell me to blame Eno? I've blamed him every single day since I found out, but where is he now? Don't you think I should blame all the vampires that also agreed to the whole settlement in the first place!"

Hearing Bryce speak his mind like this, he and the other leaders actually got a good look at Bryce's true feelings. He didn't just hate the Punishers, he also hated the vampires that had allowed the Punishers to exist. No wonder, he had been able to so easily claim their lives to achieve his personal goal.

"Do you not care what happens to the settlement, as long as you get what you want?" Quinn asked. "What crap are you talking about? The majority of vampires making up the settlement weren't even alive when your Grandfather died! Why should they be punished for crimes they didn't commit?!"

It was at that moment that Arthur let out a big sigh.

"I told you, Quinn, that no matter what you had to say it wouldn't change anything. Where even is Richard? He's not in his tomb, he escaped, right?"

Quinn was waiting for this as well., if he couldn't convince Bryce then maybe Arthur.

"Arthur, Richard is…I think he's dead." Quinn replied. "However, he's not the only one. I can at least promise you that Jim died. The Dalki were being controlled by him, you don't have to…"

Arthur shook his head as Quinn was saying these words.

"I already know about Jim's death. Your friend Fex told me, but this doesn't change anything. Even without him, the Dalki will still win this war. Before I pass on, I WILL exact my revenge!"

"Knowing that we were both tricked, doesn't change the fact that Bryce killed my friends and their families. I can't forgive him for that. The Dalki sacrificed their people to allow me to get my revenge, so I will still kill the Dragon to repay them… unless you can stop me, Quinn."

Hearing Arthur say this, Quinn knew that there was only one way out now. Still, he had one question on his mind before trying to stop the Punisher.

"Where are Linda and Fex?" Quinn said.

"Defeat me and you will find out, but I think you will soon join them." Arthur replied confidently.

At that moment, the shadow people that were under Bryce' control, charged in towards Arthur and Quinn. Bryce pushed himself off the ground, and went far away from the boy.

"I will get rid of both of you!" Bryce shouted.

However, Quinn just stood there, his fist tensed up.

'Arthur, are you saying you…killed them!'

The shadow creatures came towards him and Arhur, they then suddenly collapsed, falling on the ground. Bryce stopped for a second, wondering what had happened. He looked over at his crystal, yet it was still dark in colour, not having changed in the least and yet the shadows out there were no longer listening to them.

[Title placed]

[Leader of the Punishers]

[You now have control of the shadows in this area]

All of the shadows lifted from their bodies, revealing their true selves. Arthur could see some of the wounds he had created with his sword, the bodies now laid there on the floor, and the shadow went and joined with Quinn, adding to his own.

'The castle…it selected him.' Arthur realised.

"If you don't want to listen to reason, I'll just have to beat the both of you!" Quinn shouted in anger.

*****

# Chapter 1354 - Better Than Them
[New quest received]

[Your fourteenth castle has become a battleground]

[You have been unsuccessful in getting either person to back down peacefully]

[Quest: Throw out the intruders!]

[Reward: ????]

'Even now you're still giving me quests?' Quinn thought as he looked over the message. After receiving Eno's little gift, he was no longer able to improve his normal stats since they had been maxed out, making him curious what type of reward the system would offer him. Not just that, but there was something else that he noticed with the system as well that had given him confidence.

'So…you think I can do it, huh? You think I can take these two guys on. Not that I was going to back down in the first place.'

[Using your title's effect, you have have consumed the shadows]

[Your maximum amount of MC cells has grown]

'It's strange to see shadow users here, something must be going on.' Quinn concluded, but he didn't have much time to think.

Arthur, now knowing that the Vampire Lord had decided to fight, was charging in, but rather than at Bryce it looked like he was aiming for Quinn instead. Still, something was up, why wasn't Arthur using his shadow?

"I'm thankful you came! With those shadows gone, I can use you to speed up my attacks, Quinn! Let's see how much you've learned since the last time!" Arthur called out his challenge, swinging his sword.

"I'm sorry, Arthur, I'm afraid I can't allow you to touch me!" Quinn replied.

A large amount of Qi had been piled up in Quinn's body ever since he had defeated the Pure's Agent 2. By absorbing all those crystals in the Demi-god tier beast's hideout, he had received a boost that his body simply hadn't been able to handle… until Eno's gift that was.

Now he could use more Qi than before, and he could utilise it. To top it off, the stats Quinn received made him faster than ever before.

At the right time, as the blade was swung down, Quinn moved and went to punch the blade by its side, but before his fist even touched the weapon, Arthur already felt the force in it being pushed. The blade continued to go forward and had hit the ground.

Quinn then went in for another punch but this time, Arthur moved out of the way.

"You think, I'll allow that strange invisible force to hit me twice?" Arthur questioned, picking up the sword from the ground, and ready to slam it against Quinn.

Before that had occurred though, the flying Blood blades approached both of them from behind. Quinn could sense the incoming danger and immediately jumped out of the way, yet the Blood blades were still floating towards him.

'Blood swipe!' Quinn activated the skill, and aimed towards one of the large swords. After it left his hand, he could feel that his swipe was being controlled by something, causing his attack to miss.

'Cindy wasn't able to do that. Is Bryce's absolute blood control so great that he can even control my blood skills? No wonder, Arthur has refrained from using his Blood skills!'

With part of the Blood blades going after Arthur and some going after him, Quinn needed to deal with them, and perhaps attack Bryce. That's when he decided to activate his shadow, lifting it in place. The sword's attacks were blocked, but he noticed something. After blocking the attack, Quinn attempted to move the shadow, but just like his Blood swipe he lost control over it.

'Activate title effect!' Quinn ordered and tried to regain control over the shadow. Alas, it refused to listen to him even then. Quinn followed the escaping shadow and saw it head towards Bryce like a dog happy to see its owner.

'Is that why Arthur hasn't been using his shadow? Just what is that crystal in his hand?' Quinn wondered. It was strange, Quinn was supposed to control shadows even if they were controlled by others with his title effect.

He had believed Arthur hadn't used his shadow because he knew that, but that didn't seem to be the reason at all. The crystal seemed to be more powerful than what Quinn's title allowed him to do, even though they were in the fourteenth castle area.

'The shadow isn't the only thing I can use!' Quinn thought, dashing off the ground, and kicking the ground up as he left. Quinn was now even faster than Prima, the one that had been called the fastest vampire, and he ran past all the blood swords getting to Brcye's position nearly instantly.

"Bryce, you lost to me once already! Do you think your fancy title will change anything now?!" Quinn taunted the other vampire. Getting ready to deliver a Hammer strike filled with third stage Qi directly to his opponent's stomach. He had learned from fighting Cindy that it was important to not touch the armour, and with his improvement in Qi it should be easy enough.

"You brat, let's see who will have the last laugh after this fight! I'll make you grovel at my feet." Bryce couldn't see what Quinn had done but he could guess, and held out his palm. The King's arm recoiled backwards, firing off a red raw beam of energy. It was the Blood cannon, only supercharged with power.

The two forces collided, sending ripples out, and Quinn knew he would be hurt, so he decided to use Shadow lock on himself. The attack continued going forward and had beaten out Quinn's Qi strength but he was nowhere to be seen, instead Arthur was now following up from behind.

Arthur went and thrusted his sword forward, but Bryce had activated his ability. As the sword got within a certain range, it started to constantly be hit by some strange force, by then, Quinn had come out of his shadow lock, and appeared behind Arthur.

'Crescent kick!' Quinn went out, throwing a kick towards Arthur's head as hard as he could. Seeing as there was no way for him to avoid the strike, the Punisher had no choice but to use his shadow to defend himself.

Seeing this though, Quinn smiled. His foot continued to travel, and as the shadow went to surround it, it was suddenly pushed out of the way.

'I have to keep attacking after this!' Quinn told himself.

His foot landed solid, connecting with Arthur's head. He was confident in his shadow blocking the attack but no such thing had happened, and because of that, Quinn's foot had successfully landed, hitting him to the side.

Straight away Quinn went to chase after Arthur, but a vortex of blood appeared in front of him. Destroying the ground and blocking his path.

"Damn it!" Quinn yelled in frustration, aware that this time Bryce was getting in the way.

The leaders watching the spectacle couldn't believe it. Quinn wasn't simply strong, but he was actually able to keep up with the other two supreme beings on the field. They were watching vampire history unfold in front of their very eyes.

"How did the boy get so strong so fast? He might even be doing better than them." Sunny said.

"Quinn has gotten stronger, the situation is to his advantage." Jin pointed out. "I don't know if you noticed, but Arthur's greatest weapon is his shadow, but the King's crystal seems to stop him from being able to utilise it. To top that off, even when Arthur uses it, Quinn appears to have a way to get around that somehow.

"Quinn's speed and strength is beyond that of any vampire I have ever seen."

They were right, Quinn himself didn't know what had happened to him, but ever since his system had been unlocked and the full potential in his body got unleashed he was able to keep up with them both.

'This won't do.' Quinn thought. 'I can keep up with them, but I can't beat them like this. Without my shadow, I can't utilise my full strength, but Bryce has his annoying crystal…maybe, there's still a way.'

It was a risk, but it was the only thing Quinn could do. Right now all of the momentum of the fight was in his hands, and he needed to finish this before things changed.

[Soul weapon activated]

[Shadow overload]

*****

# Chapter 1355 - An Eye With Wings
Using Shadow overload in a situation like this seemed quite crazy but Quinn had his plans. He didn't know how long Bryce or Arthur had been fighting for, but both of them were physically wounded and not at their best. There wouldn't be a better situation to subdue the two of them then at this moment now. Quinn needed to finish it.

With Arthur unable to use his shadow due to the strange crystal, Quinn thought he would have a nice surprise for them both.

[Shadow overload activated]

The shadows started to pour out from Quinn and soon covered his body giving him the shadow body he would usually get. He was waiting to see if his shadow body would be consumed by the crystal but it didn't seem to be the case.

Then, letting out a slight flicker of Shadow control, Quinn could see it heading for the crystal. Although the shadows on his body weren't influenced by the crystal, whatever he would use would be.

'At least this means I can still use the shadow, and while I'm in this form I have unlimited MC cell's to use the shadow as much as I like!' Quinn thought. 'Two minutes that's all I have.'

[Nitro accelerate activated]

Quinn's already fast body sped up even more. There was a reason why the Vampire Lord had kept this armour set in particular, instead of exchanging it for ones at a higher tier and it was all because of this active skill.

Perhaps in the hands of a human, it would have only done so much, but on a vampire with 100 Agility, the boost from this active skill was all he Quinn needed.

Bryce's Blood swords went out towards Quinn. Seeing this, the most common comparison one could make when seeing such a sight, would be that it was like raindrops. Something impossible to avoid, but Quinn could see each and every one of the individual swords.

He ran forward, moving past each one as if they were in slow motion. They missed and slowly turned around, but every single one of them couldn't touch Quinn even for a second.

"Impossible!" Were the words coming out from Bryce's mouth, a sentiment that everyone else present would agree with.

Seeing this, the King prepared to use his blood in a different way from the swords, ready for the close combat battle that would soon come, but Quinn would interrupt any idea he had of this.

Two Shadow portals appeared in front of Quinn. He empowered his hands with just the first stage of Qi and punched forward as hard as he could. Bryce was confused by these actions because Quinn was nowhere near close enough to do damage, even with his strange powers.

At the same time though, as Quinn's hands went through the shadow, they came out from two shadow portals behind Bryce's back, hitting him from behind. The force was so great that it threw Bryce through the air, towards the tenth leader.

Quinn had actually lost control over the Shadow portals the moment they had finished forming, but he didn't care. They had served their purpose and in his current form he could do it as many times as he wanted.

Bryce was approaching him, but he had already adapted to the situation, creating two Blood swords in his hands, while he placed the crystal around his waist.

"Sorry but I'm not the one you're going to be fighting." Quinn smirked, lifting his hand, and dropping Arthur in the middle of it. Arthur was suddenly thrown into an awkward situation appearing from a shadow portal, and had no choice to once again use his sword to cause a giant explosion destroying the Blood sword but also hurting both of them in the process.

The two of them tried to recover quickly but were still hurt from their fight from before.

"Quinn…you. What is that?" Arthur asked, looking at his strange shadow body which was something Arthur was even unable to do with the shadow.

"This is you not knowing a goddamn thing about me, Arthur!!" Quinn answered, as he ran forward towards him, the blade was swung down, and Quinn had summoned his own sword himself. He swung it as hard as he could, and Arthur was getting ready to swing back.

Quinn's swordsman ship screamed immature, but what did it matter when the strength, speed and Qi behind was beyond anything that Arthur had seen before? The second the two swords made impact, Arthur could feel his strength losing out.

"I fought against Cindy using this to save the settlement! I fought against countless Dalki and more. All with the image of you in my head!" Quinn revealed.

Arthur, seeing that he would lose out in strength, decided to cause yet another explosion, but his hands were still damaged and it had started to pile up. Still, he could see no other way to get Quinn's sword off him.

A big explosion occurred and Arthur was hurt but neither had moved from their place, Quinn was unhurt. His shadow body had protected him and his sword was in perfect condition unharmed.

"This was a gift from a human! He gave this to me because he wanted me to live, to get stronger and to help save the human race! So why? Why couldn't you do the same?" Quinn bellowed, kicking Arthur's sword, sending him to the ground.

It was then that Quinn could feel something coming from behind, as he turned he could see two large vortexes of blood heading his way.

"Don't interfere!" Quinn shouted.

He started to swing the sword like a mad man, but each time it would let out stages of the third Qi, when it would touch part of the Blood vortex it would disappear and disperse. With this, Quinn created countless sword slashes, going through the air hitting the vortex until it was no more, and followed behind it was the sword itself.

Bryce had no clue this was coming. The sword went through his barrier ability of a thousand strikes. Everything that got within a certain range of the user would be struck by an invisible force that was similar to that of a sword, controlled by the person's ability. Of course how many strikes in a certain amount of time was determined by the user, and the strength of the ability itself was also dependent on the user.

This could be used in an offensive as well as defensive way but despite his ability, the sword went through without faltering and hit Bryce in the centre of the chest so hard it caused him to fall onto the floor. The sword had even slightly dented the armour as it stayed there in place.

"Arthur, I don't understand!" Quinn turned his attention back to the Punisher, now unleashing Shadow portals all over the area, he started to throw out Blood swipes, Blood disks and more into each of the shadow portals. On top of that, Quinn would create new ones so the attacks would be directed coming from a different place.

Arthur picked up his sword and started swinging, blocking a lot of the attacks, but eventually there was one person that would be there as well, Quinn himself. He threw out a knee that was blocked by the sword, but then a Blood swipe hit Arthur from behind.

Quinn delivered a strong thigh kick, this time Arthur used part of his shadow to block, but seeing this the tenth leader used the third stage of Qi to break through it. It also broke through his own shadow body, but once the kick was delivered to Arthur's thigh almost shattering his bone inside the Shadow body returned.

"Do you remember when you beat me silly before? Well I haven't forgotten it, but let's see you try that again!!" Quinn didn't hold back his spite, suddenly sinking into the ground and appearing from behind. The Vampire Lord kicked his target into the air, and then sunk into another shadow below appearing directly above Arthur and gave a punch full of pain straight on to his chest slamming him into the ground.

Arthur landed, creating a crater, leaving Quinn standing in front of him.

"Did…Quinn just… win?" Jake asked, still not believing what his eyes had seen.

It was at that moment, that all the shadows that Quinn had used in the fight, including the one Arthur had used, headed towards Bryce.

"Get up." Quinn ordered. "I'm not done."

——

At the same time, inside the king's castle. Leo had finally gotten Tempus to revert Silver back to her original appearance. The Original cared so little about them that he didn't even take the chance to verify who had actually infiltrated the castle and just handed her back after he was done.

Blood was already dripping onto Tempus' hand and had fallen into the chamber.

"Should we stop him now?" Erin asked.

"No." Silver shook her hand, placing her mask back on her face. "It's already too late."

"We have to get out of here!" Leo answered, and the three of them started to run out of the castle immediately, but who would they warn, who could they warn and what could they do.

The chamber slowly started to lift from the ground, this one slightly larger than all the others in the other tombs. Then slowly as the blood dripped onto the body inside, it started to energize them.

"Awaken, once again my old friend!" Tempus called out.

The chamber slowly started to open, and the one who had been asleep for the longest time, took a step out. There was a look of confusion as the one looked down to his hands and checked his surroundings.

"What…happened." Those were his first words, directed at Tempus as he was the closest one to him. The next moment memories of the events of everything before he had been placed in the chamber filled his head.

"ARGHHHH!" The being screamed with anger, as he walked forward and a special marking could be seen on his back. A single eye with wings.

"You have woken up, my friend! You, the first REAL King of the vampires, the only King we should have ever had! Now come and let me help you claim what's rightfully yours!" Tempus explained, with clear fanaticism as he tore off the sleeve on his shirt, revealing the same marking as the other, a single eye with wings.

*****

# Chapter 1356 - A Vampire God
In that instant, the leaders, the vampires in the settlement, and even Arthur, Quinn and Bryce could feel a strange energy suddenly enter the whole settlement. It was for a brief moment, but as it hit them, it caused all of their bodies to shudder. It was something that none of them could explain because it was something that they had never felt in their life before.

On top of that, Quinn could feel something reacting to it.

'Is it in my dimensional space? The tablet is reacting to whatever that was just now.' Quinn thought.

Still, the fight had to continue, and Quinn didn't have much time to waste, as Bryce had gotten up and thrown the sword off to the side.

"I'll kill you, I'll kill you all!" Bryce shouted.

The leaders wished to stay and watch the outcome between the three of them, even though it seemed apparent now who would be the winner.

"Did you feel that?" Muka asked.

"I did. My heartbeat twice as fast for a few seconds there." Sunny replied. "Has something happened in the settlement?"

"That would be my guess." Said Jin. "I think it might be time for us to head back. Quinn has this under control, and we can tell him our plans after this."

All of the leaders were concerned that something might have happened back at their own castles, so they decided it was best for them to check up on the situation.

——

At the king's castle, the original king, the first that had been tasked with leading all of the vampires, had been awoken once more. He was a large muscular man who had a perfect V shape on his upper body. Broad shoulders and long black hair that went down to his collarbone. The most impressive thing about him was the muscles on his back. They were defined so well one could see them even when he simply walked.

The only thing he had on was a pair of trousers, so his top half was visible to all.

He looked to be in his late forties or so with his finely trimmed beard on his face. Just like other vampires, his eyes were red, but this one had a particular glow to them, a glow that was unseen in the other vampires as if a fire was constantly burning in them.

"From what I know, that is everything that has happened since your slumber," Tempus reported. He had just given an update to the first king, the same way he had done when he was awoken. Telling him of the world of vampires and what each king had done after him, even explaining the punishers that were created after him.

"So that damned Eno first chooses the humans over Rex Immortui, the being who gifted us this power, to then give my own power away. My power was used as a chain the vampires from doing what they wished!" He shouted, slamming his foot on the ground.

Cracks started to appear on the floor, and the whole castle shook under his sheer power.

"Call all of the vampires, tell them to get out from their castles and meet in the centre. The new king, Laxmus…I shall give up my name to prove that I am a real follower of the dead god. I, Laxmus Immortui has given them their order."

Giving a bow, Tempus had decided to go out of the room first, and Laxmus, the old king, had followed. Surprisingly they could see a bunch of the Royal guards present just outside.

At first, they had helped Kyle deliver the vehicles to the king, but halfway through their journey, they had second thoughts, stating that they could do this no longer and had decided to return to the castle.

Seeing them, Tempus was ready to talk to them, but they knew they would be hard to convince, but that's when Laxmus had gone out before Tempus even reached them and looked into their eyes.

"This is an order. Tell all the vampires to come out from their castle areas and welcome me." Laxmus said, and just like how the influence skill would work, their eyes started to fade.

The royal guards immediately went out, informing all of the families in the nearby area. Tempus couldn't help but continually smile at the old king's return. He had been part of those that had subdued the king in the past, but showing his tattoo proved that he was a faithful follower of Immortui, which was why the Laxmus hadn't outright attacked him.

When they finally reached the pooling area, the place was a mess from the countless fights with Bryce and the Dalki. There wasn't a single building that had been left standing. As the order was sent out, vampires started to leave their castles and enter the pooling area, at least what was left of it.

Even they were shocked by what they could see. The people came out confused. With no leaders present in the castle, they felt like they had no choice but to listen to the command of the Royal guards.

"What is happening, was Arthur dealt with?"

"I think they might be selecting a new king, or maybe a new king has been selected."

Rumours started to spread, and eventually, everyone gathered in the pooling area from each of the castles. In the end, even Paul and the others had decided to follow the orders, not wanting to cause trouble and Kazz as well.

The reason for them coming out was the strange feeling they had felt not too long ago. Paul, Silver, and Erin had arrived; they were no longer wearing their disguises and now stood by Paul's side.

"From the look on your faces, it seems like you guys might have a better idea of what is going on at the moment," Paul asked.

"It would take a while to explain, and I'm not quite sure," Leo replied. What was worrying him was the colour coming off from the vampire that was standing in the pooling area. Now that he was awake, he could see it clearly. Although his colour was purple like most of the vampires that Leo saw, he could also see a source of white light.

The Royal guards stood in order, as they would usually do in front of the king, only this time they weren't standing in front of the king, and instead in front of a vampire none of them had seen before.

However, the vampires did recognise Tempus, who was by this person's side. It looked like the new vampire was prepared to give a speech and that the leaders had returned from their little spectacle that was happening at the fourteenth castle.

They could see their families were all huddled outside of their castles and wondered what was happening.

"Excellent, it looks like everyone who needs to be here is finally here," Tempus said. "Although, there is one person missing? Is he dead?"

"Greetings, everyone!" Laxmus shouted in a booming voice, it travelled easily through the air, and everyone could hear him clearly. "I am the vampire king, Laxmus Immortui. A servant of the one that bestowed this great gift to us all, and leader of you all.

"I, your rightful king, was betrayed a long time ago by all your family leaders, bashing me into an eternal slumber, but all I was trying to do was complete the task that our god asked us to do.

"To send more souls to the undead world. I was simply fulfilling his wish, and for some reason, they had decided to stop that. It was the reason why we exist and the reason why we were so different. Now that I am back, I plan to continue this conquest.

"We shall travel to earth and start the annihilation. Sending countless souls until Immortui's belly is full!"

The other vampires listening to the speech were confused. They had no idea what this new vampire they had met for the first time was talking about. Some strange god that they served, none of them even believed in gods. They simply cared just about vampires and themselves, even those vampires that believed they were above humans.

Some of the older leaders knew a little bit about the old past and had a bad feeling about who this person was.

"Leo, what are we going to do?" Erin asked. "I know a lot of what that vampire said sounded crazy, but I'm pretty sure he just said that he was going to get rid of all humans."

Leo was unsure what to do and was hoping that instead of them needing to act, that the other leaders would. But he feared something else even if they did act.

"It seems none of you sees me as your king. I gave an order, yet no one is moving. There were no cheers after I spoke. I see the vampire settlement has truly, truly fallen." Lifting up his hand, Laxmus made a flicking gesture, he pointed it towards the crowd, and with a flick of his finger, a red beam of aura left it.

The next second, the entire row of vampires no longer had their heads and fell to the ground dead.

The vampires screamed as they ran around the settlement, trying to get back into their castles. These actions just seemed to annoy Laxmus more. Still, before he could do anything else, all of the leaders were now standing in front of him, including the Royal guard Kyle.

"Oh my, doesn't this remind you of the past," Tempus said with a smile, looking at all of them against the original king.

*****

# Chapter 1357 - Laxmus' Strength
It was a struggle for them to gauge the strength of the vampire in front of them, but after they had seen him destroy so many vampires with a simple flick of his finger, they knew two things. One, he was powerful, and two, he didn't care about the vampires' lives at all and would do anything to get his way.

"Is it just me, or does it feel like the vampire settlement has been on its last legs a lot recently," Jin commented as he pulled out his blood weapon, the blood shield.

"Indeed, but I remember a time when the leaders would complain that nothing would happen, that their powers were wasted, well here is your chance," Lee replied.

Muka stepped forward out of the group of leaders.

"This is the vampire settlement. I know you may be one of the original vampires, but we have our own rules and ways of working. You recklessly just killed vampires under the settlement, you are not fit to be a king, and none of the council does not agree with your decision. We now have no choice but to attempt to forcefully remove you from your position.

Laxmus looked at the leaders in front of him and just started to laugh.

"There were a lot more of you last time. Do you really think that you can stop me? All of the originals only just, and there was that annoying Eno man before."

Hearing this, the leaders were unsure if the new vampire was bluffing, but he was right about one thing. That the leader's numbers had dwindled. Kazz hadn't joined in, and Tempus was standing on the other side.

The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd families had no leader that could represent them in this fight, and it was similar with the 7th, 8th, 10th and 12th families. Either they had been disbanded, similar to Jill's family or they just didn't have a leader anymore.

Leaving the fight up to six leaders, Jin Talon, the fourth leader, Sunny Kent the fifth leader, Jake Muscat the 6th leader, Muka Fortuna the 9th leader, David Scutter, the 11th leader, and Lee Sanguinis, the 13th leader.

The vampires in the settlement stood to the side, watching the fight that was to occur in front of them. They believed that it was easy work for their leaders, while the leaders themselves did not. The first to make a move was David. He had strong hard fists that would only become more powerful with each hit.

It was a similar ability to Prima, but it relied on strength more so than speed. As he ran forward, all the other leaders followed in an Arrow formation, ready to make their attack at the right time.

David threw out his fist, which looked to be twice the size of a regular person. Laxmus looked to also be making his move, as he threw his own fist to match with Davids. This was exactly what David wanted, a head to head confrontation. It was where he was at his strongest, no blood powers and no fancy tricks.

Seeing the movment of the hand, Lee decided to use his blood strings to pull back the hand of Laxmus, so he was unable to punch, allowing David to make a clean hit, but at that moment, Laxmus wasn't held back at all.

He moved his hand, and the strings didn't break but had overpowered Lee, sending his face to the ground. The two fists collided, David's fist was shattered in seconds, and his whole body went flying backwards.

That was when the settlement saw something they thought they would never see. The way the vampire treated them was similar to how they imagined a fight with a leader and a regular vampire would go.

"Do you really think someone who has been blessed with the gift from our god could be hurt by you fools!" Laxmus shouted, and a shield was seen coming his way. Grabbing onto the shield, he caught it.

Seconds later and several explosions went off. It used Jin's blood activating on the spot. Jake was pretty sure that wouldn't be enough to hurt the original and soon was placing his hands on several places in the ground, setting up traps wherever he could.

At the same time, both Muka, with his large spiked mace, and Sunny decided to attack from the side. Muka swung his mace with blood aura over it while Sunny was prepping for the attack known as blood canon.

The dust from the explosion had settled, and Laxmus was seen standing there.

"What an interesting shield," Laxmus said, and using his finger, he gripped hard, crushing it and causing it to break with pieces crumbling to the floor.

Laxmus' whole body started to turn slightly red. His entire skin was red, and it was something the leaders had never seen before. When the mace successfully hit from, Laxmus grabbed the weapon with his bare hands allowing the spikes to go through it, and using his strength, he pulled it from his hand, now holding the weapon for himself.

The blood cannon from Sunny had successfully hit Laxmus, but it didn't even move him a few inches. Taking the spikes out of his hand, Laxmus held the mace and swung it hitting Muka, and smashing his black armour to pieces, he went falling to the floor.

Sunny started to use her blood powers one after another as she constantly kept moving, keeping her distance. Laxmus then dashed over towards her, but she had carefully made a note of where Jake had laid his traps.

It was then that one of them lit up, and Laxmus was unable to move. Seeing this, Jin made a cut on his arm and threw out his blood, attacking with everything he could, and Sunny and the other leaders had all done the same.

However, despite all of this, Laxmus' red skin was still intact, and the only wound on him seemed to be from Muka's mace that he had self-inflicted.

"The leaders…they can't beat him…" the vampires thought.

They could see they had used great skills and their abilities, yet it was quite clear that the vampire was hardly injured. The vampires didn't know what to do. If they were to run into their castles, it was quite possible that they would be attacked.

It felt like all they could do was watch as a new vampire king was forcefully selected.

"I was right. You guys are weaker than the ones before. Let me show you what a real blood attack looks like." Laxmus said as he smiled.

Placing both his hands to the side, a red ball of aura could be seen gathering in both of them. Blood would spin constantly. It was then he threw it out that two beams of red energy shot out. It looked like whoever or whatever it touched would be destroyed.

The beam was too large for the leaders to avoid, so they all prepared blood cannons, firing it off into the red energy beam. Their own attacks had joined up, creating a powerful blood attack, but it was a dwarf compared to Laxmus'.

When it touched, it did nothing, and the leaders could see their lives flashing before their eyes, until a certain girl with black hair who they hadn't seen before stood in front of them. She stabbed her large sword into the ground.

'Third skill activated.'

Soon an ice wall started to appear, and the attack hit the ice wall, and it wasn't breaking at all. It was then that the attack began to reflect back, and it was now heading for Laxmus himself. Seeing this, he had no choice and braced himself.

He gathered energy in his fists again and punched the energy upward, almost redirecting it into the air. Still, he wanted to hit it all away, but some of the energy had still hit his body.

Soon the ice barrier disappeared, and Laxmus could be seen, huffing and panting. His skin was partly hurt from his own Aura attack.

"What was that!" Laxmus shouted out. "Tempus!"

It was then, that a red blood swipe, faster than any of the vampires had seen, shot out from the side, Laxmus lifted up his arm trying to block it as if it was no deal, but it had cut through his arm and left a large cut on his skin, drawing even more blood.

The one that the leaders thought were invincible had just been hurt and damaged twice.

"It looks like the two of you took all the limelight," Paul said.

"In a fight like this, that does not matter. We just need to win." Leo replied.

As for where the two attacks had come from, the tenth family seeing them started to cheer.

"It's the tenth family! The vampire knights and Erin."

"Vampire knights," Laxmus said, holding his arm, trying to figure out what this weird energy was. "Vampires from the tenth family hurt me, and they were knights at that!"

The leaders themselves couldn't believe it. They didn't understand what happened but knew it had come from these now standing in front of them. However, Erin had used her strongest skill and had the element of surprise using it at the perfect time, still Laxmus was not yet defeated.

To top things off, Tempus went to Laxmus' side and placed his hand on him, and in front of all their eyes, Laxmus' wounds that he had just received had healed.

"That is going to be a troublesome pair," Paul said. "Looks like we need to get rid of him, first."

*****

# Chapter 1358 - Vampire Knights
Out of the blue, three strangers seemed to have become the settlement's hope. After they saw that the leaders' attacks did nothing to harm the strange vampire, suddenly they bore witness to how those from the tenth family managed to harm him.

Laxmus, now having made a full recovery, had decided to change his plans a little after meeting these new vampires. He ran toward the Royal guards who had just stood by the side, not sure what they were meant to do.

It was a sorry sight to behold. They had once represented the glory of the vampire settlement, yet their number had dwindled to a mere fifteen, the rest having perished in battle. The Royal Knight Kyle stood in front of them since he was meant to command them, rather than with his family members.

"Kill them all!" Was the the simply command Laxmus gave the Royal guards, and nearly in an instant they turned against the crowd of people, charging in without any mercy.

"Wait!" Kyle shouted. "What are you doing?"

It was obvious that the Original King had used something similar to the Influence skill, but each Royal guard had around the strength of a Vampire Knight. Not even leaders could force them to do their bidding unless the guard might have served under them.

"Stop, this is an order!" Yet, no matter how loud Kyle yelled, it did nothing as they ran into the onlooking vampires, yet the leaders were there to prevent the normal populace from suffering any harm.

Sunny and Jin, were the first to go to combat with the Royal guards, hitting their spears away, and delivering a palm of red aura. Still, they would recover and attack again as if they were possessed.

"Leave the protection of the settlement to us!" Sunny shouted towards the tenth family group. "You're the only ones who can harm him, so please, defeat that tyrant!"

This seemed to be the will of the other leaders as well, as they joined the fourth and fifth leaders in holding down the Royal guards.

"You heard them!" Paul said. "They're relying on you two. I know my powers aren't enough to beat him. I've only learned how to use the first stage of Qi from the other vampires and I seriously doubt it will so much as tickle him."

"Still, there is another annoyance that I can help you get rid of." Paul never planned to just sit around and watch. He went to face the one who had awoken the strange vampire, the current leader of the second family, Tempus.

As long as he was there, not only the Royal guards but Laxmus could be healed over and over again. In a way it was of the utmost importance to get rid of Tempus before any of the others and Paul knew this.

The leaders and the vampires watching this thought Paul to be suicidal, because Laxmus wasn't far away, but the second he tried to move towards his fellow Original, Erin ran forward and pointed out her blade between the two of them.

Out from the Demon tier weapon came a large ice tunnel, until it hit the castle wall, creating a barrier between the two of them.

"You and your damned sword again!" Laxmus cursed as he turned around, looking at both Erin and Leo.

"This might be a harder fight than against Arthur. Now you will finally get your chance to show off all your skills!" Leo stated.

——

The reason why Paul was able to run head first towards Tempus was because he had confidence in his allies, or at least that's what he would have liked to think. While running over his heart kept beating louder hoping that they would do something. He wasn't a fool, he knew he had no chance going up against Laxmus, thankfully they did help out in the end.

'Now, it's time for me to do my part!' Paul thought, as he banged his gloves together to reveal the poison claws and immediately went striking towards Tempus, who moved out of the way quickly, avoiding each of the strikes.

"Are you really just a knight, you are a bit fast for one?" Tempus commented as he calmly went to grab Paul, but before he could, a set of strings had come out, and wrapped around the Original's hand, pulling it away.

"Don't let him touch you, if he does it's all over." Silver warned, and at that moment, not wasting time, from her chest a red glow could be seen.

"I will pay you back for embarrassing me!" Silver shouted, as nearly an identical version of her, appeared. The only difference was, it looked like this version of her was slightly red. Silver quickly attached strings to herself, and charged in along with Paul.

'What is this, a blood weapon but where did it come from?' Tempus wondered. The feeling was similar yet different at the same time. Regardless, he went in and avoided the sword strikes. At the same time, Paul came from the side striking again, yet he missed as well.

However, it looked like he was finding it difficult to attack as well.

"This is annoying." The next second Tempus decided to charge in, and one of the Silver's was successful in her sword strike, scraping his chest. A smile appeared on Tempus' face, as he moved to the side and grabbed her hand, trying to activate his ability, yet it wasn't working.

"Now!" Silver shouted.

It was at that moment, that eight flying balls of poison could be seen, and Paul made sure to target them all from different directions so the balls wouldn't miss. He was using his soul weapon as well. It wasn't a battle where either of them could hold back and a single touch could change the battle.

The poison hit, with no regard for the Silver that was still being held and this was because he had figured out that it was nothing but a puppet. The strange thing was, the Silver that had been grabbed was coloured, while the other one was tinted slightly red.

Which was why Tempus was slightly confused by how he could have been tricked by them.

"Idiot, I can make the puppet look how I wish! I thought someone as simple as you would fall for this."

It was then that, all the poison had successfully hit the Original, it immediately made him feel weak and he fell to the ground. Paul saw this as his opportunity to go in, and so did Silver. The two of them were beyond annoying.

As they came close, Tempus smashed the ground lifting up rocks in the air, in mere seconds his body looked to be recovering to what it once was. All the poison damage that had affected his body had disappeared.

"I'll make you pay for having tricked me!" Tempus' lackadaisical attitude changed to one serious, now not caring whether he was hit or not, he went straight towards Silver. Her puppet had been damaged and destroyed by the poison. It was their one chance she thought they had, but didn't realise just how fast the Original could heal.

Still, as Tempus reached out his hand, Paul had arrived from underneath stabbing his claws directly through it.

"There's two of us!" Paul shouted.

He could see Tempus using his open palm to hit Paul again, but he simply stabbed it with his claw again, hitting the other's open palm. As he was now, the Vampire Knight decided to use all the poison he could to weaken their enemy, yet they seemed to be at a standstill.

No matter how much poison he pumped into the other's body, the vampire kept reversing its effects, returning to prime condition.

'We have to get rid of him!' Silver thought.

Tempus was moving slowly forward pushing through the pain, and allowing for the claws to go deeper into his hands, all he needed to do was touch Paul. At this point, Silver was behind Tempus and tried to slice off his head.

However, having expected as much, her attack only struck on an outer layer of Blood hardening that he had used to protect his neck. Silver struck again, this time aiming at another area and slashed at his back, but the second she pulled it out, it looked like his body was healing on the spot. She continued to cut but her attacks just weren't strong enough.

"Why! Why!" Silver shouted in frustration.

It looked like time was up, for Tempus was soon upon Paul. Pushing through the pain and walking forward.

"You just need a little more help!" Another female voice stated.

She came from the other side, with a sword of her own, and started to stab at Tempus' back, but the stab didn't just make one wound, but made several in the same place, cutting the inside of the body as well as the outside.

"It's been a long time since you and I fought side by side like this!" Kazz said.

The two of them continued to attack. Tempus had seen the other leaders fight, and he was confident. How could three simple knights allow him to reach this level?

It was then that Paul, also summoned the poison balls hovering over his head again.

"You didn't think I could only do that once did you?" Paul smiled. "A commander knows when to reveal his trump card. I was waiting for her to join in."

The second Paul had entered the field, he had caught eyes with Kazz off to the side, she looked a bit lost, but at the same time concerned. Still, he and her had gotten close, and he thought that she wasn't the type to just stand there and do nothing when her people were being wrongfully attacked. It was a bit of a gamble but it had paid off.

The floating poison hit Tempus from the front, and as soon as all eight balls hit him, his reversing ability wasn't as quick. Paul, quickly, pulled out his claws, and all three of the knights started to attack Tempus non stop.

Eventually, a claw, and two swords stabbed Tempus right through the head, causing the second leader, the Original, to meet his end… to Vampire Knights…

The dying vampire had no idea where things went wrong…but he only had one regret.

"I won't get to see you…send them all to him." Tempus murmured as his vision went, looking over the ice barrier at the other side.

# Chapter 1359 - Not A Vampire
Erin and Leo had no time to help the others, for the foe in front of them were far more dangerous than any they had faced before. They just had to hope that the others would be able to deal with the second original.

If there was one person that Leo felt like he could trust, it was Paul. During his time while serving him, he was a man who was a great fighter and knew how to use people and abilities to their full potential. In some ways, he was even better than Leo when it came to things like that.

"Your sword is annoying!" Laxmus shouted as he dashed over to Erin. It was the person he deemed as a bigger threat out of the two of them.

Even before the fight, Erin's hands were shaking but not because of fear. It was because the urge inside of her had grown ever since she had set her eyes on this person.

"Leo!" Erin called out.

She needed to do something and knew that her actions would leave her open, so she relied on her trusted teacher, who stood in the middle of her and Laxmus. Leo quickly placed the sword back in his sheath and took one step forward.

Then, concentrating, he waited for the right moment before pulling the sword out as fast as he could, dragging it out. A large line of red aura was seen that looked to even rip and cut the air itself as it was distorted to the outside viewers.

'My fastest and strongest strike! I just hope it gave Erin some time.' Leo thought.

However, the strike could be seen hitting Laxmus' hand, and this time there was no wound at all.

"I admit I let my guard down for a second when you hit me before. Whatever you are doing causes problems for my healing, so I won't let you hurt me again," Laxmus said.

Where the strike had cut, the forearm of Laxmus was jet black. It looked like a strange material had grown on his arm, but this was simply a form of blood hardening, a stage that no one had ever reached before, apart from him.

'I had enhanced my strength and even covered the strike with the second stage of Qi, yet it was still not enough to cause a cut on his arm…this person is beyond anyone I have seen before.' Leo realized.

Still, he had done his duty, for Erin was finally ready. She was making preparations. Her large Demon tier sword was placed on her back, and she had drawn the Katana blade while also releasing the chains, so they were now only on her wrists.

The reason for doing this was quite simple. The strongest part of the Demon tier weapon was the stats they provided the user. With it on her back, she could still receive the energy from the sword. On top of that, two of the active skills had already been used.

In the current situation, the second active skill of the Demon tier weapon was useless since Laxmus didn't seem to be using any armour or weapons. Which was why she had opted for the katana blade that she had more practice with in the first place.

'First movement.' Erin recalled in her head, as she spun her body and the chains ran across the floor, the first one wrapped around Laxmus' left leg, and the second one was ready to wrap around his thigh.

However, before the second chain could touch him, Laxmus grabbed hold of it. He had planned to rip it apart, but when he pulled it, the chains didn't break.

'The chains are covered with the second stage of Qi. They won't break so easily.'

Still, Laxmus' power was greater than Erin's, and she was seen being tugged through the air, but at the same time, while floating in the air, she had her sword pointed outward while with her other hand, her palm was on the back of it for support.

"You just helped me!" Erin said. She had never felt this way before, strangely new energy was rising in her, and it was completely different from the times in the past.

She couldn't help it, and she could not control what was about to come out from within her. She didn't know if it was because the suppression chains were off or if it was because of who she was facing, but her eyes started to glow yellow, and a yellow Aura could be seen over the sword.

As Erin prepared to strike from the front, Leo went from behind and prepared his one-strike slash again, placing it back in his sheath.

'In this fight, I will be the support.' Leo thought, as his attack was only meant to be a distraction.

Seeing the yellow Aura, Laxmus' confident smile faded away, and instead, anger was building up in him. A vein appeared on his forehead.

"You let a Dhampir exist!" He shouted.

Laxmus' skin turned redder, almost the same colour as blood itself. He no longer looked like he was human. Next, as Leo threw his one strike, it had stopped midway. When he looked up, it hadn't hit his back, for instead, it had hit a pair of wings.

The black hardened blood covered the entire of Laxmus' forearm and went up halfway to his bicep, producing something that looked similar to that of a flame pattern. His fingers elongated, becoming more boney while his nails grew, and his head also seemed to elongate as well.

No longer could anyone who looked at this being think they looked human or like a vampire. This was something more along the lines of a bloodsucker, only something far worse.

'This was the white energy I could sense inside. It has mixed with the vampire self…this is not a vampire.' Leo realized.

However, it was too late for him to do anything. Both of Laxmus' wings flapped with such strength that it sent Leo flying across into the crowd. A few of them stepped to the side, while members of the tenth family who had trained under him had grabbed Leo.

They continued to skid across the floor, but these members were ones that had trained in Qi and had used whatever power they could to finally hold Leo.

"Are you okay, sir!" They asked.

Leo hadn't replied but instead spat out some blood. With the flap of wings, a force that went through his Qi had struck him, hurting him. All he could think now was that Erin was in trouble. Lifting his hand, the yellow aura hit Laxmus' open palm, but it looked like it did nothing.

The sword had done nothing. Erin tried to pull on the chains to reposition herself. She moved over to the side, but Laxmus grabbed both of the chains and pulled them apart this time. Despite them having been coated in the second stage, they had no trouble breaking as the links fell to the floor.

"You are getting stronger even now. You can not live!" Laxmus said, his voice much deeper than it was before. He opened his mouth, which stretched beyond what was humanly possible. The skin by the side of his mouth opened, allowing him to open it four times what a human could, and a red beam of aura energy could be seen gathering.

The next second it was unleashed.

"Please be ready!" Erin thought as she pulled her Demon tier weapon out from her back, and she could see the ring was no longer on cool down. She pointed out the sword activating the first skill. It shot out the ice tunnel directly towards Laxmus.

The two great powers hit. As the ice tunnel hit the red aura, it started to freeze over it, but the attack hadn't stopped being produced from Laxmus' mouth, and the ice was getting destroyed by the second. The red aura beam was winning. It continuingly struck the ice until it finally looked like it was about to reach Erin.

'The Demon tier weapon lost out. His attack was stronger?'

"You did well, but it's time you leave it for us." A voice said, and as the red aura was about to touch Erin, a shadow could be seen rising. It smashed into the shadow and stayed there in place while someone grabbed Erin and moved to safety.

The shadow then moved, and the red beam was redirected into the sky. Lighting up the whole planet and had gone so far out through the sky that perhaps, those from other planets could see it.

"The shadow power, my power!" Laxmus said, turning around. That's when he could see a man holding onto the opponent he was facing just seconds ago.

"Why…" Erin asked as she was gently let down. She didn't understand, why of all people now, had Arthur decided to come and save them.

However, Arthur just looked towards the one in front of him and held his sword in his hand. At the same time, there was another by his side.

"The king, the king is here!" The people shouted.

Both Arthur and Bryce stood a few meters away from each other, looking towards the original king. By now, the fight with the Royal guards had ended, Paul and the others had defeated Tempus, and everyone had moved away to the edge of the vampire settlement.

"Wait, why are Arthur and Bryce here? What happened to Quinn?" Sunny wondered.

Arthur looked towards Bryce.

"You heard the boy. We just have to give him some time."

Bryce scoffed and walked forward.

"I was never counting on him in the first place!" Bryce answered as he lifted his hands, summoning the hundred blood swords.
