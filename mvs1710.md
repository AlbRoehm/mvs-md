# Chapter 1710: Wife Candidate!

The others were currently being offered whatever they wished in the canteen.

Due to it being the main workplace for Logan and somewhat his home, there were many important staff around them who helped the Green city function.

Although most of the facilities were handled by robots and AI, certain jobs needed the human touch, such as communication with other cities, decision making on large projects and more.

Logan had learnt that not everything could be decided with numbers and figures. Sometimes just because it was the best decision on paper didn't mean it was the best decision overall.

Although the guests were enjoying their time, it was safe to say that many others were looking their way because it was unusual for certain guests to visit the place.

"Hey, Muka, don't you think it's best if you put on your helmet?" Vorden said. "I think that's why everyone is looking this way."

Muka turned and looked at the others in the room, giving them a smile, which almost caused a fight, as the men were rushing over, trying to see who would approach her first.

Eventually, it looked almost like a stampede was coming their way.

However, before the men could even reach, the black AI Robots stood in their way, stopping them from getting closer.

"It is hard to eat with a large helmet," Muka stated. "Besides, they didn't show my face on that video, so I am free to go about as I wished."

The others awkwardly smiled because they knew that if Muka did walk down the streets, she wouldn't be able to move freely.

The reaction of onlookers in the room was just a small presentation of what could happen.

Muka was such a beauty that even being rejected by her was a blessing for many if they could manage the will to approach her in the first place.

"Why is Auntie single if she is so beautiful?" Minny asked as she slurped her juice boxes, now on the fifth one.

The others were wondering what the answer was. After all, it wasn't like vampire leaders didn't have relationships.

"I think the answer is clear," Mitchell commented.

"There would need to be someone who matches her beauty, smarts and strength. In short, they would need to be an even luckier person than her."

Thinking about this, it seemed impossible that there would be such a person, the others thought, but there was one suggestion from a certain little sweetheart.

"What about Dad?" Minny claimed.

"I think dad is handsome, strong, and awesome when he is fighting and has this really cool look on his face when he is saving someone."

Minny had hopped onto the table and raised her hand in the air, imitating when Quinn had summoned the dragon and his facial expressions.

"You're talking about his Majesty?" Muka put her delicate long and soft fingers on her chin and gazed into the distance with a thoughtful expression on her face, "He certainly is the most impressive man I know... I wonder."

"Does Quinn have someone he likes?" Jessica suddenly blurted out while twiddling her fingers.

"I mean... you know we learnt about his life in the museum, but there wasn't a single person mentioned who could have been his wife or a partner."

It was obvious to most on the table that Jessica had feelings for this person.

"You see what happens, Quinn." Vorden thought.

"You go around saving these damsels in distress, and they go falling for you. Meanwhile, all you are concerned about is helping and saving them."

"He does." Peter finally answered. To which all the women, including Hannah, were surprised to hear this.

"Vorden should know this as well. There was someone that seemed to be closer to him even before us."

"She was always there to support him... it makes me wonder what he's going to do next."

The others couldn't help but think about just who this girl could be, and in the end, Lucia, who could tell the other girls were too shy to ask, had decided to pop the question.

"Who is it...do we know her? Is she a famous figure?" Lucia asked.

Just as Peter opened his mouth to reply, they heard the clicking of the automatic door, which soon opened, and they couldn't help but glance to see who it was.

And upon seeing who it was, everyone subconsciously decided to keep their mouths shut, apart from Minny, who jumped off the table and ran up to Quinn and spread her arms for a hug.

"Have you been a good girl?" Quinn smiled as he lifted Minny up, like a real father playing with their child.

This loving father figure moment of Quinn holding up Minny just made it, so the other girls feel a small pain in their hearts.

Soon, another stood up and walked towards Quinn. It was the dark-haired Vorden.

"Quinn, I didn't want to leave until I said goodbye to you," vorden said, placing his hand on Quinn's shoulder.

"I just wanted to tell you that I have to leave soon. The Blade family, me and Shiro are currently their leader."

"You saw how dangerous the Chained could be. Fortunately, not all of the Chained were siding with Russ, and those that were, we need to keep them in check in case they create any trouble."

"In fact, we, the Blade family, have unanimously agreed to keep the sinful Chained members in check and not let them ruin anyone's lives. We pledged to make up for our family's doings."

"Of course, if you need help with anything, like the Chained event or taking down the dhampirs, we will be there to support you. Although I have a feeling, you won't need our help."

Placing Minny on the floor, Quinn and Vorden gave each other a hug. Shiro then swapped out with Vorden, and the two gave each other a big hug once again.

"You should visit the Blade family area sometime," Shiro said, handing Quinn a small card.

"If you give anyone that card, they will be able to take you to us. Or just put it in one of the spaceships, and it will activate the autopilot feature."

After bidding their goodbyes, Quinn walked up to the table, to which all of the girls almost starred away from him.

"What is going on here?" Quinn asked.

Minny looked toward the other women, and a smile appeared on her face.

"They're talking about who should become your Wif..."

Lucia had a stream of lightning following her before Minny could finish what she was about to say, and her hands were already covering the latter's mouth.

"We were just waiting for you," Lucia said.

"What's the plan? We know there are a lot of things for you to do."

The group moved to a private meeting room, away from others, as what they were about to say were personal matters.

"Before I go on, I want to make sure that everyone still wishes to journey with me."

"After all, you now know who I am and what I plan to do, but I understand you all have your own lives. Jessica, you could now stay here, under the protection of the Green family."

"The same is for you, Muka. Lucia, at any point and time, if it gets too tough for you, Zinon will be happy to welcome you back to the Graylash group."

"I understand everyone has their own lives, so if anyone wishes to leave, please, let me know."

The room was silent, as everyone had already decided a long time ago to follow Quinn.

"Very well, then, as a way of me approaching your loyalty. I will return the favour to you all."

Quinn had planned to give them celestial energy and had a surprise for Lucia: the Demon tier amulet, but before he could give it, Muka stood up and walked up the front and stood opposite of Quinn.

She placed both hands on his shoulders and looked him up and down before pulling Quinn forward and pressing her soft lips against Quinn's.

"What is going on... is this... did Muka just kiss me."

In truth, perhaps Quinn should have pushed away, but feeling her soft lips against his, he was enjoying the moment. Eventually, Muka was the one who pushed away.

"Please... make me yours." Muka requested.

***


# Chapter 1711: Power share.

Everyone stood up from their seats, and their mouths were left wide open. The girls, in particular, looked like their cheeks were red tomatoes, unable to let the words come out of their mouths.

"She... certainly is a daring one." Hannah thought. "Making that declaration in front of everyone!"

"Does this mean that now Minny will have a baby brother and sister, now that the two of them kissed?" Minny asked, a little excited.

"Huh, what? That's not how babies are made," Peter replied, scoffing at the child.

"Are you an idiot? Babies are made when a man and women..." Peter felt a hand placed on his shoulder.

"Please, don't say anything more; she's just a child," Mitchell whispered, wanting to protect the innocent child, who started to sob.

"Minny is not an idiot!" MInny started to cry out loud.

There was so much chaos in the room at once, all from a simple kiss. However, one person had his hand raised over his lips and seemed calmer than usual.

"Muka," Quinn said. "Explain what you mean."

"I heard from the others that you gave them a marking proving they were loyal to you and granted them great power."

"So I wish for you to do the same." Muka explained.

Quinn thought something had occurred that something was strange. The kiss didn't feel like Muka had done so out of compassion or love.

On the contrary, it was almost as if it was a task that she had to do. "Then, why would you kiss him!" Jessica shouted.

"Lucia said that Quinn just gave them the marking, you didn't have to kiss him!" Muka then looked towards Minny.

"She claimed that it was the way one had to prove their loyalty and get a marking."

Hearing this, Minny had stopped her sobbing. When she felt several eyes on her, she started to curl up and back into a ball before giving off a soft smile.

"Hehe, I... I... I'm sorry!" Minny shouted.

While the two were walking to the meeting room, Minny had an idea to make it so both Muka and her father would be happy.

"I just thought that Daddy would be happy getting a kiss from such a beautiful girl, and I thought that Muka would be happy as well. I didn't know everyone would hate me." Minny looked like she was ready to break into sobs once again.

That was until everyone consoled her. "Don't be silly, and don't worry, no one is angry at you, Minny," Jessica said. "Just next time, help us all out, okay." Jessica winked.

The commotion seemed to be over. Now that Quinn knew what Muka wanted, he explained everything that was going on to her, especially about the changes Muka might experience.

"I accept. I told you before that I already think I have spent my time up in this world."

"So agreeing with this is a no-brainer if I can finish it by helping your majesty and find out who dared to steal the vampire tombs."

Kneeling down, and as Quinn started the process, a marking appeared on her body that others couldn't see, but she could feel that it was successful.

Now it was time for Quinn to see just how many celestial points he could give to Muka.

When giving the points, he told her to inform him when she started to feel pain. Surprisingly, Muka's limit with celestial points seemed to be at the 100 mark.

So currently, she had 100 points of celestial energy, which was more than the others in the group.

"The Red Vampire that I took care of didn't have many celestial points... I wonder if this will make her the target of other celestials?"

"I'm also interested in what form she will take on. Just based on her ability and appearance, I have absolutely no idea."

At the same time, it wasn't exactly the place to test such a thing. Although the celestial energy was in their body, Quinn could only tell when being close.

It was easier to feel when actually using the celestial energy, and he thought this would be the same for the other celestials.

The last thing he wanted was to make Green City into a war zone because he was testing a few things.

After that, Quinn decided it was best for him to increase the celestial points in the others. So, first, he went ahead and gave celestial points to Mitchell.

When giving him energy, he seemed to have improved from the last time. Maybe it was because he had used the celestial energy somewhat now, but he could control 20 points of celestial energy.

Lastly, there was Minny and Peter. Earlier, Quinn wasn't so sure about giving Minny a lot of celestial energy, especially if it would make her a target.

Still, since she should be with him most of the time, he knew they would be a big target anyway since they would be travelling as a group anyway.

In the end, Minny said she didn't feel any pain until 100 points of celestial energy, putting her at the same level as Muka.

"That is impressive; I knew Minny was special for some reason, but to be able to contain as much energy as a vampire lord leader... it's amazing!"

Minny was proud of herself as she walked with her chest puffed out.

"Alright, Quinn, give me whatever you got!" Peter said, punching his fist as if he was ready for a fight.

Just like the others, Quinn slowly transferred Celestial points to Peter one by one, waiting for him to feel pain. Peter wasn't one to feel pain, but he could feel the energy entering him.

"Come on, Quinn, I can tell you have a lot more than that... just give it to me!" Peter shouted.

Quinn didn't want to give in, but it seemed like Peter had no trouble at all even though they had already passed the 100 mark with Celestial points.

"I have a lot of celestial points... but I wonder how far can Peter go?" Quinn thought.

Eventually, Peter had gone past the 200 mark, and it continued pushing him past 300 and even crossed the 400 mark.

"Peter's body can contain a lot more celestial points than the others..what's the reason for this. Is he close to being a celestial himself?"

"...or even a God Slayer? He is the closest to me in terms of strength from all of these, but if he is a dedicated follower... maybe I am holding him back?"

Thinking about this, Quinn had stopped when it finally reached five hundred.

"Wait... I can keep going." Peter asked for more.

"I know you can, but I need to keep some energy for myself, and I think you should continue focusing on getting strong on your own. You don't want to just rely on my strength." Quinn stated.

"What about me?" Jessica said. "Why won't you give me any of this special energy!"

Seeing what had occurred, Quin somewhat expected something like this to happen.

"Jessica, you're young, and you have a long life to look forward to. Although I don't mind you travelling with us, this marking is something that I can't reverse."

"I promised to look after Minny since she is my responsibility, but you? Do you think you will be travelling with me forever?"

Hearing this, Jessica clenched her fist and stormed out of the room.

"Fine, I understand... I will see how it is!"

Quinn didn't know what to do but thought that it would be best to leave her be for a while.

Because right now, he didn't have a solution to make her feel better. Still, he could see someone else who looked a bit left out and down in the room.

Walking over, Quinn moved his hand towards her and lifted the pendant in front of her.

"Lucia, Logan has given me this pendant, and it is yours to keep."

"Although I won't be making you a dedicated follower, I do have another gift I can give you." Quinn stated as he gripped the pendant tightly,

[Would you like to place a Celestial Marking on the Demon-tier Amulet?]

[Yes]

***

# Chapter 1712: Blood Amulet.

The demon tier amulet would be the first weapon to receive the celestial marking of Quinn. He thought it was a good choice for many reasons.

For one, the object's size was small, it was almost insignificant for him in terms of power boost, and lastly, this was perfect for a trial because of its high tier.

The effects of the marking were still unknown. At the same time, since Quinn would permanently lose the celestial points, he didn't want to test out such skill on a weapon of a low tier grade.

And at the same time, he thought it would be a good way to help Lucia be less dependent on the others and a gift from him as gratitude to her ancestor, Robin Graylash.

"In the future, when I have more Celestial points to play with, I can start to do more testing, but first, I need to see what this skill does." Quinn thought.

A red glow appeared around the Amulet, and the red celestial energy could be seen moving through Quinn's veins. The glowing red energy was soon pumping towards the Amulet.

Just like when passing on the energy to others, Quinn could feel it exiting his hand and finally, the red glow stopped, and so did the celestial energy flowing through Quinn.

[Congratulations]

[You have successfully marked the Demon tier Amulet]

[You have created "The Celestial Blood Amulet']

Opening his hand, Quinn could see that the appearance of the Amulet itself had changed. The marking on the entire front had the red dragon with wings engraved on it. At the same time, the colour of the Amulet was now a dark red.

"Quinn... what did you do?" Lucia asked, looking at the Amulet.

It was time for him to find out for himself.

[Inspect]

[This Amulet contains a marking from the Celestial Quinn Talen]

[The Amulet can draw energy from the blood that has been split within a fifty-metre radius. Energy will be kept in the Amulet until used for one of two things. The Amulet can empower the user with blood energy, combining with the user's current blood energy, combining with the user's current powers.]

[The second use of the Celestial Blood Amulet is to use the blood gathered to create a blood clone. The blood clone's life will be linked to the amount of energy in the Amulet.]

Reading the Amulet's effects, if someone told Quinn there was an item that could do such a thing, he wouldn't have believed it no matter what.

For one, the Amulet basically granted anyone wearing the time blood aura to play with. Furthermore, it enabled them to do this without having to be turned.

At the same time. Quinn noticed the particular note that they could combine this with their current powers.

Perhaps, Lucia would be able to do something akin to the red blood lighting Quinn had produced at one point.

Then there was the second ability of the Amulet, the blood clone. Although Quinn didn't know how strong the clone would be, the clone itself reminded him of his own blood bankability.

If the enemies hurt the clone, it would heal itself using blood from the Amulet.

"To be honest, the abilities of the amulet aren't too far off what they were before."

"We still need to gather energy to use this weapon, and the only difference is that the energy is now blood instead."

"Still, the effects of the item itself are different, and it could be a coincidence, but I doubt it." Quinn thought.

Thinking about this, Quinn wondered if there was perhaps a way to create a celestial item from scratch.

Rather than marking existing demon tier items, what if there was a way to use a demon tier crystal or add his own blood and celestial energy to the mix during the creation process? Perhaps it could create something truly impressive weapon?

"To do that, I would have to find a forger. There are probably other forgers out there who can create demon tier items, but... honestly, I feel guilty."

"I don't want anyone but Alex to create my weapons, and I want to stick to that."

After seeing the status of the newly marked weapon, it was time for Quinn to see how much Celestial Energy it cost him to level up the item in the first place because he was sure that it was a large number, more so than any of the transfers of energy he had done before.

[2000 Celestial points have been used to consume to create the Blood Amulet.]

[5235/2605 Celestial energy]

Quinn was relieved that he still had plenty of celestial points for himself Because he still wasn't sure if he would need them for his upcoming battles.

Still, it took a large chunk of his celestial points to create one weapon, so he wouldn't be doing it again any time soon.

"I wonder what would happen if people stopped meeting my condition? I know the system stated that my level would go down, but what about the weapons I mark?"

"Will they remain at this level, or will they also downgrade?"

Regardless, no one could answer the question for him now.

Then, handing the amulet over to Lucia, he explained what effects it could now do, and once again, the others in the room were amazed. Others in the room had never learnt of anything like this before.

"You... are someone worth worshipping this whole time," Hannah exclaimed while taking a deep breath, "Quinn, I haven't said much... because I had..."

"Let's leave it here for now." Quinn said, "I don't know my relationship with the Red Vampires just yet So I would like to keep our relationship for now like this as well."

"After all, I haven't told all of you yet, but I plan to find the Red Vampire's base and their leaders."

"If you truly believe what you said, try and help us get to the red vampires and help me find Layla."

Saying this, Quinn glanced at others for a moment and then left the room, heading out to find Jessica wherever she was.

*** *** ***

Jessica hadn't actually gone that far out of the room. But, once down the hallway, she had stopped realising that she didn't really have anywhere to go.

"I can't believe I just stormed out like that: I shouldn't have acted like a spoiled brat in there."

"I mean, Quinn was the one that saved me; how could I just shout at him like that after everything he's done for me."

Embarrassed by her actions, Jessica covered up her face and slowly started to slide down the corridor wall until she was sitting on the floor.

"I was just so useless, I couldn't get out of that wedding, and I'm useless now. Of course, Quinn would never like someone like me."

"That's not true." A voice suddenly replied inside of Jessica's head. It was the first time she had ever heard something like this; thus, she was so stunned that she couldn't even react as the voice continued.

"Did you know that Quinn was also considered weak for most of his life? There was something that Logan didn't project in that museum, and that was Quinn's life before his rise."

"It was much harder than a life you have ever experienced, and yet he had decided to change it." The voice said.

"Huh, wait, who are you? How do you know Quinn? How are you even speaking in my head right now?"

"Jessica was trying to think, but the only one with this ability was a few vampires with the Red Vampires, but then why would they be here or trying to cheer themselves up."

"You don't have to worry about me but worry about yourself. Believe me, Jessica, I know about you."

"Who your parents were, your father, your mother. You're what the vampires once truly feared, and now it's up to you to change that."

"You are a natural-born vampire, no correction, and you are also a natural-born dhampir, unlike the Queen. You will play a significant role in Quinn's journey."

"Wait," Jessica stood up. "How do you know that? Who are you?!"

***

# Chapter 1713: A Beacon.

Heading down the hallway, Quinn was relatively surprised to see Jessica hadn't gone off too far, but he could hear her heart racing and noticed a strange expression on her face.

Stepping off, running full speed ahead, Quinn went to her side and had shadow equipped his gauntlets.

Jessica was pulled close to Quinn's chest as he clad his one hand around her shoulder and was ready to summon his blood aura.

"Who is it... how many of them are there?" Quinn asked.

Being held by Quinn and so close, Jessica felt heat rising in her cheeks. The strange voice in her head already flustered her, and now this.

"Wait, Quinn, there's a misunderstanding there is no one here... at least I think there is no one here." Jessica explained.

Just in case, before putting Jessica down. Quinn tried to sense if there were any different energies around.

Unfortunately, he didn't feel any foreign celestial energy or red aura, only parts of Of coming from others in the vicinity.

None of them seemed threatening, and since Quinn couldn't really detect them that well in the first place, unlike Leo or Erin, so seeing it was safe, Quinn released his grasp over Jessica.

"I'm sorry, it's just when I saw you looking like that, it reminded me of when you were with the Chained. I thought you were in trouble again." Quinn explained, not wanting to seem like a creep.

While Jessica was calming herself down, she started to think about whether she should explain to Quinn what had happened.

The thing was, she wasn't exactly sure herself, what it was or who it was. Either way, it seemed like someone who knew about her past.

"Quinn," Jessica said in a soft voice. "There is something I need to tell you, something about me I think you need to know before we continue to travel. It's something that might get you in trouble."

Quinn could tell that this was quite a serious matter, so he instantly brought her into the shadow space.

Here, no one could hear what was about to be said. But, honestly, Quinn had come here to speak to Jessica himself to comfort her.

Looking around, Jessica gave herself a deep breath. It was still hard to believe that she was really standing by the legend himself.

"You heard what Hannah said about me before, about how I'm a vampire," Jessica said.

Hearing this, Quinn started to think back. He actually wanted to speak to Jessica about this because if Jessica really was a dhampir, how could she control her urge?

Maybe if he found out this was the answer to also stopping Erin from whatever was happening to her.

"I am sure you already know that dhampir are formed after getting turned by another Dhampir."

"Other than that, a dhampir can also appear due to a subclass. However, there is a rumour that those aren't considered true dhampirs."

"Many believe that a real dhampir is the one who was conceived and came to this world naturally I'm sure you know that a vampire and a human can't have a baby, but what if I told you that did happen?"

"Quinn, among my parents... my mother was a human, and my father was a vampire."

"Wait, Jessica was born as a dhampir... and from her words, she's the only one that has come into this world this way."

"Does anyone know about this, is that why you don't have the same urge to attack vampires as the others do?" Quinn asked.

"I don't have the urge other dhampirs have. I thought maybe it was because the dhampir part of me was weak or something, but I'm afraid that there are people who know the truth about me, and perhaps the Chained also captured me because of my identity."

"I don't know if I'm special; I don't feel special at all, but there might be those who believe such rumours and will come after me because of that."

From Quinn's memory of living Vincent's life, he remembered that one of the families attempted to create a dhampir by capturing humans and mating with them.

It was why Vincent had ended up killing the leader and leaving the vampire settlement. For some reason, vampires believed that a dhampir would be the death of the vampires.

After learning what was happening with Erin, Quinn believed that to be the case, but what if it wasn't?

What if Jessica, who was in front of him now, was what they were afraid of?

"Let me know if you feel any different, and Jessica, as long as you stay near me, I will try my best to protect you from anyone who wishes to harm you," Quinn replied, clenching his fist.

"I won't let a second Erin appear. Last time I brushed off the responsibility to Leo, but I won't let that happen again."

*** *** ***

Since the group had no next destination to go to yet, the intent was to stay with Logan until they had a plan.

After having a pleasant night's rest, Hannah wished to speak with everyone the following day.

She stood in the room, which they all shared so they could keep an eye on each other, explaining her plan.

"I can't get in contact with the Red Vampires as I wish, not at the moment," Hannah explained.

"Instead, I have to wait for them to contact me. However, I think I have a way we can try to find those that might have more information."

"Those with the Red Vampire markings. The only people who can travel freely through this city are Travellers. They are considered a third party or sometimes mercenaries."

"They live in all kinds of cities, without supporting either group, just wanting to make a living by hunting beasts and doing odd jobs."

"Many Red Vampires disguise themselves as travellers for this reason. It might be hard, but perhaps we can run into a few of them and gather information."

"There might even be a few who would recognise me and would help, but if they know me, I doubt that they would have more information than I have."

"That could take an extremely long time," Logan said as he entered the room uninvited.

"How about rather than looking for them, you make them look for you? These groups are cocky, and everyone believes they are the strongest, but that's because they don't know the great Quinn has returned."

"Maybe we should send a message to everyone?"

Thinking about it, maybe there was a way for Quinn to attract the Red marked Vampires if he released the large amount of celestial energy he had gained?

It would make them aware that another celestial was there.

However, it was risky because it could attract the wrong celestial, perhaps even God Slayers that Quinn had recently learned about, or it might also scare others away. On top of that, it would make the City a battle zone.

"The City can protect itself, and besides my Son, Vicky and I are here as well. So trust me, whatever comes this way, we can deal with it." Logan said as if he could read Quinn's mind.

"Finding the Red Vampires and their leaders is important to you. I'm just embarrassed I can't be of more help."

Make my enemies come to me?' Quinn thought about it for a while, but in the end, he needed to find the Red Vampires before the dhampirs did.

Of course, he could try and go to the Pure base, but facing someone on par with Chris and Zero on his own was too much. Perhaps fighting in Logan's territory gave them an advantage.

After deciding what to do, Quinn had requested to go to the top of the tower

And soon, everyone was out on the roof, waiting to see what he would do. On the roof, there were two large spikes above them that almost pierced the sky.

Then above that was a large floating ball of sparkling green energy, as if restricted between the two spikes. Quinn could tell it was pure beast energy. Logan had created this defence system for the City.

"Logan, I'm going to borrow this, and as you said, I'm going to tell everyone that I'm not afraid and that I'm right here if they want to fight me."

Quinn flew up to the green ball of energy using the demon tier item.

He then activated the celestial energy throughout his body, and the others on the roof suddenly saw the energy ball going through his body.

He couldn't keep this up for long otherwise, the demon tier wings would be destroyed. At that moment, he created a small cut on his hand and controlled his blood so it would constantly flow into the giant green ball of energy.

He was infusing his celestial blood aura with the Green energy.

Soon, the ball started to turn red, and the whole sky did with it, casting over the entire City. Quinn activated more and more of his celestial energy into the green ball, and it spread all over the City.

"I won't run away, I'm right here," Quinn said, holding his hand out on the ball.

Seeing his actions, Logan couldn't help but smile. Was it time for Quinn's official return?

***

# Chapter 1714: Intruder.

The ball of green energy, which earlier looked like a miniature sun, looked even more so as the colour of the energy slowly began to change. Finally, the giant ball turned entirely red with the aura, growing in size with every passing moment.

[A large amount of blood is leaving your body]

[HP is decreasing due to blood loss.]

"I guess I can use as much blood aura as I want without it affecting my HP, but using my Celestial Energy this way, by inflicting a wound myself, isn't exactly the best choice for a prolonged use, but it's all I got right now."

Once the energy had completed engulfed the green ball, something strange started to happen.

The red energy ball's power began to spread throughout the city, and the devices that used this energy also started to emit the energy.

It started to rise up like a red fog, eventually reaching the skies and turning them completely red. The people down below were beginning to panic, as it looked like death was upon them all.

"I did say he could do as he wished, but I didn't expect him to do this," Logan said, placing his hands on the ground.

He was accessing the city's system. He ran the whole city using the technology that he integrated with the giant energy ball.

However, to his surprise, he found out that there was no malfunction. The people below even, when hit by this fog as such, didn't suffer any harm.

However, the clouds in the sky began to darken, and soon a weird phenomenon occurred, the sky began to rain blood.

"Isn't this just like back then?!" Hannah exclaimed as she stared at the sky. "This scene is familiar to when Quinn faced off against Graham."

It did seem familiar to Logan. Only there was more chaos back then, vortexes of blood, and even red lighting.

Still, this scene was pretty close to what had occurred back then. To do this much without blood or war around, Logan was impressed.

"You certainly seem to keep getting stronger, but it makes me wonder whose attention you will get with this display"

The sky was dark red, and the clouds had spread far out of the city, hovering over the sea. Quinn stopped sending his celestial energy into the ball and decided to fly back to the roof below him.

He had hit the ground on one knee, feeling a little exhausted. He had used most of his celestial energy up, and it seemed to take a toll on him, most likely because of the large amount and for realising it directly out from his blood.

Still, the energy continued to spread, and if one was to look at the Earth from a distance, one could see a big red dot on its surface.

On top of that, it had somewhat done its job. However, it had done its job a bit too well, unknown to Quinn.

The strong celestial energy wasn't just felt by those on Earth, but others who had been keeping an eye on Earth could also feel this strange energy.

"It looks like a rookie has just discovered his powers, are we meant to be impressed?"

"There seems to be a lot of chaos going on around Earth these days, Are the others even doing their job?"

"Immortui has taken a liking to the place. He has been having a lot of fun there for a while, and it has been a good energy source for him."

"Hmm, Immortui is quite troublesome, yet he allowed for a new celestial to act so rampantly? The amount of energy isn't even that great!"

"You know, that energy doesn't always correspond with strength."

"It just allows us to influence things in a specific direction more. Besides, when was the last time you met a new celestial that reached this level, rather than being celestial since birth."

"I would say that things might become very interesting on earth."

*** *** ***

The energy had finally dispersed, and Quinn was recovering quite quickly and was no longer using the energy. His strength was back to normal, and he could use his blood powers, Qi and shadow freely.

The only thing that was affected for a while was the celestial energy itself.

"What did you do?" Mitchell asked.

"I sent a message out, telling someone that I was here. You might be getting a few visitors, Logan, but you said it would be fine, right? They could handle it?" Quinn asked.

Quinn was hoping it would catch a particular vampire's attention: Laxmus. Something strange had been happening ever since he woke up, and Quinn had a theory that it had something to do with another celestial being.

The one who controlled Laxmus. Putting the pieces together, Richard Eno stated that he had been the one to summon a god into their world, and that was how he and others were turned into the first vampires.

This included Laxmus. Now knowing more about the celestials, it was clear that Laxmus was serving another celestial as a dedicated follower.

Maybe he had become a celestial on his own, or a God Slayer, no one knew, but this Celestial and Laxmus had enough time to gather energy for more than a thousand years while Quinn was asleep.

As Logan said, they were cocky and probably, would love to try and take Quinn's energy for their own.

On top of that, seeing that the marking was on an item, perhaps there were more followers other than Laxmus and the red vampires.

"Well, I guess now would be the best time to tell you this," Logan smiled. "There actually should be an influx of visitors from all over soon because I have created a special event."

Logan typed away on his arm for a few seconds, and a screen appeared in front of them all.

"The Special Unbeatable Green city challenge. Face off against the strongest Green City Battle Robots and win the legendary prize belonging to the Great Hero Quinn!"

The others looked at the promotion, a well-made video, of those fighting off against the black Al robots they had faced before.

Showing different abilities in an area of some type, then there was an image used, the one of Quinn right at the end, but it was of the old style Quinn.

"What's the special prize?" Jessica asked, excited.

To which Logan tapped his lips.

"Now, that's a secret: enter the event if you really want to know. Anyway, after your little display here and the tournament to be held in the next few days, I'm sure there will be some you would like to meet."

"The event is a good way for us to gather information about the strength of our own, the strength of our enemies and allies."

"Not everyone was at the Chained event, and I'll keep the borders open so we can catch some Red Vampires. You don't have to enter; just enjoy the show."

Quinn wondered why Logan hadn't told him this before. Otherwise, he wouldn't have to have done his little act, but anyway, Logan was right that it most likely would attract even more people.

With that done, everyone was going to head back inside the building. Maybe explore the city again now that they had a couple of days ahead of them.

But just as Quinn took his first step, a bright light suddenly appeared below his feet, surprising everyone.

It was a circular light that only surrounded him.

"Logan, the f#ck is that?!" Peter shouted as he suddenly had a bad feeling and instinctively stepped towards Quinn.

"That's not me; I didn't set this up. Quinn, get out of there!" Logan was shocked too.

But before they could even understand what was happening, Quinn had long disappeared from the spot.

*** *** ***

Quinn found himself in a bright empty white void. It reminded him of his shadow space, only the polar opposite. Still, one person stood opposite him, and in her hand was a staff.

"What have you done!" She immediately cried aloud as soon as he appeared.

***

# Chapter 1715: Out of my way!

The person in front of Quinn was someone he hadn't seen for a very long time. He had heard about her a lot more than directly being in confrontation with her, but in the end, she was someone that he would never forget.

Despite her not looking exactly the same, she still looked quite familiar, and the energy in front of him was without a doubt celestial energy. He immediately sensed it, since he was also a celestial now.

"Bliss," Quinn said."Oh, I'm surprised you remember me," Bliss replied.

Her voice was low but deep, and Quinn could sense the anger in her tone. It was clear she was upset, and she wanted to have a conversation without the others hearing, therefore, she had brought him to this weird space.

Quinn looked around before responding. He wondered where he was and if there was a way out of here, but he senses nothing. It certainly was strange and he needed to be on guard.

"If it's a separate space, and works a bit like my shadow space, then maybe I can destroy this space too to escape if things get out of hand."

Quinn thought, assuming the chances of this meeting ending on a good note were low. After all, he wasn't really in a good mood as this person just whisked him away against his will.

The celestial in front of him, although at times seemed to be on Quinn's side, Ray had given plenty of warnings about her, and the fact that she had lived for so long as well, Quinn could imagine she was a powerful Celestial.

"What is this place? And why did you bring me here? Why are you even annoyed at me?" Quinn asked, seeing that Bliss's hand was gripping the spear.

"I'm here to talk about that beacon, that beacon of celestial energy you shot out of nowhere!" Bliss shouted.

"What were you thinking? Do you know what you have done? Do you know what your actions could do to Earth? The whole planet can now become a battle zone!"

Bliss took a few deep breaths. It looked like this matter had seriously affected her.

"I'm sorry, but there isn't really a guidebook on a teacher to teach me about all these celestial 'rules' Quinn replied. "And besides, I don't care. There was a good reason why I did that: to find my friends."

This reply was met with loud laughter from Bliss as she slammed her staff on the white surface.

"You still think of friends and family as a celestial? Don't you understand, Quinn? You are a god now!"

"You will outlive all of your friends. Even if they find ways to prolong life, they will either die in some battle, of some disease or even by accident."

"Perhaps, you will continue to make new friends and continue your life, but eventually, you will feel nothing."

"No longer will you feel a friendship for someone or sorrow when someone passes away because you will realise that it is just the cycles of the universe, and the universe has chosen you to play your part."

"The only thing you will feel is the satisfaction of completing your condition. It's foolish to continue thinking the way you have done!"

Honestly, Quinn had given some thought to what Bliss had said. Was his life endless now?According to the system, one of the levels meant that even if Quine died, he would be reincarnated.

On top of that, he felt that his emotions were numb whenever using the celestial energy. This wasn't something that just occurred over time; it was something about becoming a celestial that had changed him.

"I... am starting to know what Vincent sensed back then." Quinn thought.

"Besides, you need to look at the bigger picture." Bliss started to explain.

"The more you directly meddle in world affairs, the more celestials will come to this place, and do you know what might happen then?"

"They might just think that it's easier to get rid of this one small planet and its race to keep the balance overall."

"That way they can focus on creating balance on other planets and places. Now, do you understand, your act was like a big beacon?"

Quinn somewhat understood, but he wasn't expecting another celestial from other places to come, but he also had an answer for that.

"You think you know what this Universe wants?" Quinn replied.

"The universe decided to make me a celestial in the first place for a reason."

"So if you really believe in all that crap, then even I am here for a reason, and while I am here, I'm going to protect this place."

"So, even if all of the other celestials come here, then I will just have to beat them and tell them to get lost. I care about what I want right now, and right now, I want to find Layla."

"You seem to like to snoop around in people's business, orchestrating everything as you wish."

"I bet you know where she is, so why don't you tell me if you really want me to stop doing crazy things like that?"

There was a deep frown on Bliss's face, and Quinn could see the energy rising in her staff. He was ready for a fight, and it would be a fight with an actual celestial for the first time and against someone he knew.

He wondered how he would fare, or if there would be no contest at all, but slowly, the energy diminished from Bliss's staff.

"Listen to me. I can't see your future anymore, but I can guess what you're going to do. You're going to fight anyway, so let me give you an ample warning."

"If you want to save the lives of the human race and not cause more trouble than you already have done, then don't use your celestial energy."

"And get rid of the God Slayers and anyone who looks like they might become one, you understand?"

"I have been keeping the balance well until you showed up!"

Quinn took a few steps forward and twisted his hand slightly.

"You talk a lot; if I'm such a problem, then why don't you kill me? Or maybe it's because you're afraid... afraid that you might lose." Quinn smiled.

Once again, Bliss laughed at this comment.

"You knew celestials are all the same. When you come into this world, you try to fight against the other celestials, doing things your own way."

"But soon, you will realise that the celestials are not meant to fight against each other. We have to remain united."

It was then that a thought came into Quinn's head: what was Bliss's condition? Why did she use her powers of future sight to try to save the human race? At the same time, he started to think of what Laxmus said at the time.

If Laxmus was really doing the work of another celestial, then Laxmus was trying to send as many lives as possible off this planet.

"Wait, it's all making sense now. What Logan said about the celestials keeping balance, and what she said just now."

"Bliss was never in a war with some other god; rather, the two of them were working together."

"She tried to save as many lives as possible while the others tried to take it."

Thinking about this, Quin thought about how many lives were lost and how many people had to suffer when the so-called god in front of him could have saved their lives.

There was anger rising in him as he remembered his close friends.

"All of this, just to fill some conditions? So the celestials could feel a small sense of satisfaction?"

Having figured it out, Quinn didn't want to say anything, not directly to them. There were too many things he had yet to understand, for one, this space they were in now. So instead, he said his final words.

"You left me a message, so now I want to leave you with one as well. If you're neither going to help nor kill me, you should step out of my way, or I will be the one coming after you."

***

# Chapter 1716: Invisable barrier.

Quinn was often a curious person, but as he grew and experienced more things in his life, he no longer had the patience to get involved or be a part of someone's games, and it was worse when he knew others were involved in such situations against their will.

Which was why he was ready to face the consequences of his actions even now. By now, a red aura had begun to gather in his hand. Quinn wasn't planning to use his celestial aura from the get to.

This was because he wanted to see how far he could go without it and the best chance for it was nowhere against another celestial!

If Quinn was right about how he interpreted Logan's theory, Celestials were beings who were worshipped by many living beings for one reason or another.

But this didn't mean that all Celestials would, in fact, be strong themselves even if they had a huge amount of celestial power.

Unlike them, Quinn had gained strength himself, rather than being born with this strength.

Another thing to note was that he was also a God Slayer, therefore, there was a good chance that he would be able to go against Bliss without bringing out his celestial energy.

"What guts, young one," Bliss smirked. "However, you have no idea how small your world is."

"You can't even comprehend what level I am on and how big of a mistake you have just committed."

As soon as Bliss finished her words, she stomped her staff on the surface once again, and the white space below their feet cracked.

Within seconds, several cracks appeared throughout the white space, and when Quinn looked back at Bliss, she was no longer there.

"What is happening? Where Am I?" Quinn thought as he activated his wings and started to fly about, worried about where he would be once the space broke.

"Get me out of here, you bitch!!!" Quinn yelled, unleashing a red aura all around him.

It was blasted in all directions, instantly destroying the white space.

*** *** ***

Upon the high tower, the red energy had long dissipated, and things were going back to normal, but for the people who were on the roof, everything was but normal.

Everyone felt a sense of panic after they witnessed Quinn disappear without any prior warning.

At the moment, most of them were looking everywhere on the tower, high and low, to see if he was anywhere here or if there was some invisible barrier that he was stuck in, but they were having no luck.

"How is this possible?" Logan repeated this question for the tenth time as he continued to inspect the marking on the ground, precisely on the spot from where Quinn had disappeared.

Everyone had seen the ground lit up, and now there was nothing on the group. However, using his advanced set of tools, Logan could sense a source of energy coming from this location.

"That rules out that this was an illusion. Something definitely happened here, but how? How could someone other than me be able to bypass all the security to get up here?"

"Whoever this person was, it's clear that our opponent is a powerful one."

Eventually, after searching the area for some time and still having no luck in finding Quinn, they all returned to Logan, hoping that he would have some good news. The shake of his head wasn't a good sign though.

"This is Quinn we are talking about. Not just anyone could snatch him away from us, and no less while we were present." Peter spoke angrily and looked in Logan's direction.

"You... you didn't do this, did you?... You sure you aren't secretly actually working with Pure and somehow teleported him away from us?"

Saying these words, Peter was already walking over towards Logan with heavy footsteps.

"Hey, let's not fight against each other, that's the worst thing we can do." Jessica said, getting in between the two of them.

"We need to find Quinn or figure out a way to find a way to know wherever he is."

"What about the little girl?" Mitchell asked.

"Doesn't she have the power of the shadow? Quinn was able to teleport himself to her side before. If he is somewhere, he should be able to teleport again, no?"

"But since he hasn't returned yet, doesn't it mean that he might be in trouble or isn't able to use his powers?"

Hannah replied, and then turning towards Minny, she slowly asked, "Can't you go to Quinn instead? Or if you can't teleport to him, how about trying to sense his location? That can also help."

Minny felt like she had a lot of pressure on her, but she also wanted to know where her dad had gone. Closing her eyes, she started to concentrate and used her shadow powers to see if she could feel anything.

However, there was nothing at all. Minny's eyes started to well up as she felt like she could do nothing and that it was her fault that they could not get in contact with Quinn.

"That won't work." A voice suddenly rang in the room, surprising everyone.

Turning their heads, everyone saw who was speaking: a woman with a staff in her hand. Although most didn't recognize her, Logan knew her well.

"Bliss! I felt you might have something to do with this, but I didn't think that you would actually meddle this much. Logan said.

"Tell me, were you the one who took Quinn out from the tomb, along with the others?"

Hearing this, the others knew that the person in front of them was serious business. To be able to do such a thing was a giant feat in itself, and thus, everyone suddenly went on guard.

"I'm not obligated to tell any of you that." Bliss stated, waving her staff as she did. Minny's body suddenly rose from the ground, and it looked like she was floating in the air.

She tried to struggle, but no matter how much she tried, she couldn't stop the invisible force from pulling her forward, and in the next instant, she was being held by Bliss's hands.

"Is it telekinesis?" Jessica frowned.

It happened so fast that the others didn't even have the chance to react. But as soon as they received the initial shock, they immediately ran forward to get back Minny.

But they had taken just a few steps when they felt as if their bodies had just slammed into a hard wall.

Bliss had built an invisible barrier, and now, no matter how hard they attempted to hit it, they couldn't even get an inch closer to her.

This included Peter, he was also finding himself helpless. But he didn't feel defeated. Instead, he pulled back his fist and punched it into the invisible barrier with all his strength.

However, all this strength only created some visible ripples across the barrier's surface.

"You are troublesome, and I want your shadow powers to be gone." Bliss's staff started to light up, and Minny's eyes began to turn black.

The shadow was coming out from her body, escaping it, and heading towards an item tugged away inside her robe, which, upon careful conversation, looked like a clear crystal.

"Don't you dare hurt her! Stop right now!" Jessica shouted at the top of her lungs.

"LET GO OF HER!" Everyone suddenly heard a loud yell, and they could see Peter throwing out his fist, but not just that, his body had transformed, looking slightly different from before.

Not only did he have the strange head-tail, his arms up to his forearms, but his skin was also black, raging with the red celestial energy inside of him.

While both his fists were completely red, like a volcano ready to erupt at any moment.

As his punch smashed into the barrier, it created much bigger ripples, this time with additional shockwaves of red aura.

In the next moment, a crack suddenly appeared in the air. Then, as silence filled the room, the invisible barrier suddenly broke into a million pieces in the next instant.

"He broke the barrier?" Bliss gasped, stunned by Peter's strength.

***

# Chapter 1717: Fight the god. (Part 1)

None of the others had the chance to use their newly-acquired energy yet. After all, Quinn had moved fast, doing one thing after the other, and it didn't seem like Quinn wanted them to use their energy in the city in the first place.

Despite what he had ended up doing in the end. This was why, even for Peter, when summoning the energy, the result of what had occurred was a surprise to even him.

However, consumed with the rage and the will to help Minny, Peter hadn't even noticed the new changes that had occurred to his body.

Everyone had taken a step back. They knew the barrier was strong: a former vampire leader couldn't even beat it with her strength, Lucia's lightning powers also seemed to have next to no effect, but the one who had succeeded, not holding back, was Peter.

The shards from the barrier were seen for a few seconds before they disappeared into nothing but energy, and standing there was Peter.

"Give Minny back!" Peter shouted, charging forward.

"He smashed through the Barrier... that damned Quinn, he gave this person Celestial energy, and he gave them a lot by the looks of it. How can someone so normal hold so much!" Bliss thought.

Still holding onto Minny with one hand, the shadow continued to pour out of her, and with the other, Bliss waved her staff.

Out came five other energy blasts. They were yellow in colour, and as they moved in the air, they started to spiral straight towards Peter.

Immediately, he threw out both of his fists, hitting them dead on, and a large explosion occurred, blowing a large gust of wind behind Peter that the others could feel.

Peter's tail head had also dealt with a third blast, but there were two more that he couldn't deal with.

The two directly hit him in the stomach, spiralling as they hit his body, causing him to be pushed back.

Standing behind Peter. Muka was there, and she had her hand held out. At the right time, she readied herself.

Peter was just about to hit her, and at that moment, she stepped on the ground using all her force. In a flowing motion like water, she opened her palm and pressed it right against Peter's back.

"Don't worry, luck is on our side, and I'm sure you can take this!" Muka said.

The colliding force was hitting Peter in the stomach and in the back, but he was no longer being pushed back until he fell off the large tower they were on.

Eventually, the energy dissipated, and Peter's armour on his chest and the clothes underneath had disintegrated. The skin on his abs had burned off, but it was healing at an incredible speed.

Seeing that he was okay, Peter rushed forward again towards Bliss.

"You, you troublesome Wight, I should have known that all of those next to that damned Talen would be just as annoying as him!"

Looking at her right hand, it looked like the shadow from Minny had disappeared entirely, and she had somewhat fainted or had fallen asleep.

At the same time, the crystal hidden within her robe was now filled with a dark substance as well.

Letting go, Minny's body hit the ground hard because she knew that she would need hands for what was about to occur next.

Holding the staff nearer to the top and bottom. Bliss started to spin it, and with each spin, two balls of energy were coming out from both ends.

At the speed she was spinning her staff, it looked like soon, there would be hundreds of attacks of the same type.

Still, Peter was prepared; he continued to run forward and punched the energy blasts while hitting the others with his head.

With his strength and celestial energy, it looked like as long as he didn't hold back in his attacks, he could equal out to its power.

The problem was, there were far more attacks than last time, and now five energy blasts were coming right at him.

Before they could reach him, a strong blast of lighting came out, infused with Qi, followed by a red aura. Hannah and Luci had both used all their power to try and block at least one of the attacks.

Still, the energy blasts only decreased in size rather than completely disappearing, which showed how strong the attacks were.

Before it could reach though, the floor started to shift, and immediately it lifted up, creating a shield.

The energy blasts had hit, and the explosions went off again, but the building was still intact.

"This building is made of the strongest materials we have discovered in the last 1000 years. It won't fall just from some damned energy blasts!" Logan said, his hand on the ground, his eyes glowing green.

At the same time, Peter now wasn't the only one that had transformed. Mitchel had his eye turning dark red and his arm growing nearly twice the size, eventually thinning out, looking like a rifle.

He readied up and fired out blast after blast, which was more than he could do before. As it hit the energy bolts, it would pierce through them and disperse them.

"You really want to fight with us!? Even if you are some god that can see the future, it doesn't mean you will always win!" Logan shouted.

Surprisingly, out of all the chaos, one more had managed to get through.

And that was Jessica, as she had leapt right in front of Bliss and had grabbed both ends of the spear, using all her strength to stop her from spinning the staff anymore.

"I guess there is a use to being the weak one after all." Jessica said, with her eyes glowing.

"You ended up ignoring me... I can see now that you never cared about me!" Jessica shouted.

Pushing Bliss forward, it looked like there soon would be a breakthrough, as the attacks were stopping, and the group were dealing with the rest of the energy blasts. Until, the ground lit up, once again.

"This is getting a little too dangerous for my liking," Bliss said.

***

# Chapter 1718: Fight the god. (Part 2)

The strange white light surrounded Jessica and Bliss, and they all could tell it was the same one that had taken Quinn away. Jessica wondered what to do.

She wanted to let go, but it was as if her hands were stuck on the staff. Seeing this, Peter had no choice. He decided to no longer care what would happen to him.

He allowed the energy blasts to hit his body, his head swung to the side for a bit, but his legs kept moving. It looked like part of his ear had been torn off, but it was healing in the process.

Running at full speed, Peter was almost faster than the energy blasts, so many couldn't hit him in the first place until finally, he had reached Jessica. From the back, he pulled her out of the way.

Immediately, Peter grabbed her tightly, pulling her into his chest, and shelled her up into a ball.

The remaining energy blasts hit Peter, creating immense energy of light that pierced the eyes of the others with so much pain that they had to look away.

When they could feel the heat from the energy attack had faded, they looked and could see Peter still there. His head-tail had been served.

Multiple parts of skin from his body were burnt off, and he was almost entirely naked.

"PETER!!!" Lucia screamed, running over.

His body was reverting back to what it was and, at the same time, was healing was as well. Eventually, Peter let go, he felt tired, but there was no permanent pain.

On top of that, he was happy to see that Jessica was unhurt.

"This celestial energy... It's different... it's as if there are two of me. Whatever happens to my celestial form doesn't affect the current me."

Clenching his fist, Peter could still feel his strength; he could still fight in this state; although weaker, he was still plenty strong.

It was a good use that he perhaps could use for later.

Before the others could see anything, Logan had shot out a giant spider from his armour that had landed right on Peters's groin, covering the area up.

It was the least he could do. After all, he ended up in that state because he risked his life to protect Jessica.

Still looking at the mess around them, Logan couldn't help but let out a large sigh as he heard sirens coming from the distance to check if everything was okay.

"Not even celestials that I thought were good ones seem to be on our side." Logan sighed.

The group were currently back inside the building resting. Even Peter, for the first time since Logan had known him, was resting as well. If there was one clear thing, that new form of his tired him out.

The truth was, many of them, including Peter, wanted to stay outside on the rooftop, waiting to see if Quinn would return. Logan tried to explain how it was unlikely he would, even by now, especially with that woman's powers.

In the end, the only thing he could do to convince them was put a few robots on guard that would inform them immediately if Quinn was to return.

While resting and getting checked up by 100 different robots in the medical room, Logan was searching for answers.

Trying to look at the cameras and more of how exactly Bliss was able to get up there and if there were any clues of what happened to Quinn.

"Im sorry." Peter eventually said, out of the blue while the room was silent with everyone else.

"I'm sorry, I thought that you might have been the one behind all of this... it just so much has changed since Quinn, and I came back, and I was with him that whole time, and now I failed him... He's gone."

The Wight hardly showed emotion other than anger, it was the first time the others had seen him act this way, so they knew how much the whole thing must have meant to them, but even more so, Peter felt highly guilty for accusing Logan.

Logan then lifted up one of his arms encased in metal and pressed it with his other hand. The metal started to retract, eventually revealing a scaled black arm.

"IA lot of my body has changed since you last saw me, and truth be told, I could have removed my Dalki arm and replaced it with a robotic one."

"...but I didn't because this arm was the memory had of you, Peter."

The others didn't know the meaning behind what Logan was saying, and they were more surprised to see that Logan's arm didn't look human. This was never revealed to the world in all of the video feeds and more.

It made Jessica and Lucia realise there were a lot of secrets that people had kept that they just didn't know about. Of course, Peter knew that arm was the arm that Logan had given Peter to eat when he was on the verge of death.

Someone who was able to do that, who was such a dear friend to the group, would have never betrayed them, and Peter now knew how stupid he was being.

To break the awkward silence, the group were greeted with good news, and that was because Minny looked to be waking up. She slowly opened her eyes and looked around the room at the others.

"Did I have a bad dream... where is Daddy?" Minny asked.

The look on their faces, the look they couldn't hide that said it all, told Minny it wasn't a bad dream at all, and as expected, the waterworks had started.

After giving Minnie a juice box, she seemed to calm down, and the others were curious about what had happened to her.

"Do you know what that nasty woman did to you?" Jessica asked.

Although Minny wasn't sure when waking up, she was sure now, she couldn't feel something with her, it was a strange feeling, but she knew. She held out her hand, and there was nothing; there was no shadow.

"I... i... i can't use the powers that Dad taught me!" Minny started to cry once again.

While the sentimental women who were best at comforting Minny were trying to calm her down, Logan was thinking.

"This whole thing, it's like when Bryce had that strange crystal and was taking the shadow. Did Bliss do the same?" Logan thought.

"I always thought it was strange that Bryce had managed to get that Crystal, and from who?"

"It looks like we might have gotten our answer.' Logan looked at the back of the others. Quinn, where are you... and I hope you're safe."

***

# Chapter 1719: New Talent.

The next couple of days passed by quickly, with most in the group feeling down. Nevertheless, they were expecting Quinn to return.

Even if he was teleported to somewhere far away, they thought that knowing where they were, he would at least try to make contact.

Some of them feared that Quinn might be in danger, especially after facing off against the celestial Bliss.

And, seeing how strong she was and what she could do, they thought that she might be able to give Quinn a run for their money.

However, Peter quickly disagreed with that statement. Peter was sure that a woman like that could never beat Quinn, which was why she had to use such underhanded methods in the first place.

"Alright, you guys," Logan said, bursting into the room.

He placed his hand on the side of the wall, and the beds the others were sitting on began to move and eventually sunk into the ground.

Some of the others fell to the floor on their back, while others were quick enough to react and were standing up.

"You guys just can't mope around sitting here forever until Quinn returns. I already said you could stay here until he returned, so it's not a problem, but I think you guys should prove yourself useful and help him out."

"That event I talked about, it starts today. There is already a large influx of people coming here. With my reward and Quinn's display, it might be the people you are looking for."

"If you could find out where the red vampires are and where Layla is before his return, imagine how happy he would be?" Logan spoke.

The others looked at each other. It was true that they were pretty much doing nothing, and this was something that Quinn would have done anyway if he was here.

"Logan is right," Jessica said, standing up.

"Logan is looking for Quinn, and I'm sure he hadn't just disappeared again after all this time, he already helped me out with the Chained, so the least we can do is help him."

For some reason, of all the people in the room, because these words were coming from Jessica, they felt guilty, as if they were the ones that should have said these words first rather than her.

"Quinn is a person with great luck, so I agree," Muka added.

I looked like the group had been given a second wind, and they were ready to act, putting a smile on Logan's face.

"They aren't quite at the Cursed factions level, but Quinn always manages to find some amazing people." Logan thought.

"Now remember, although this is my event, I will be doing things fairly. The winner will receive the grand prize. Of course, you guys don't have to enter and can just watch as I stated, but if you do enter, I should warn you."

"Some of these travellers are strong. There will be a few triple-A ranks there."

"After a thousand years, new generations had taken the stage, just like when there was Quinn back then and others in the past, and it would be ignorant to believe that they can't match you in terms of strength."

"Of course, there will be new talent everywhere."

"There are even who have been training to become someone greater than Quinn Talen and to make their names even bigger than his, and they will see this tournament as a good starting point."

"Remember, even Quinn was also a nobody once. And one last thing: wear these."

Opening up from Logan's side was a little canister that expanded into another item. After Logan gave them the things from it, they all could tell that they were masks.

"They aren't like the masks before. Unfortunately, the Red Vampires have taken a liking to that style but wear these, so you don't attract attention, alright?"

"I'll be busy with other things, but I will be keeping an eye on the event from here."

The masks were all white and were basically a solid piece apart from the breathing slits and the side accented with a light blue glow.

Everyone wore one, apart from Peter, who could easily disguise himself.

"Why do I need one? My face is not known to the world; I didn't appear in the broadcast." Muka said.

"In your case, it's not about the broadcast, but it's about attracting attention, and wearing a large helmet, like you used to, would also attract attention," Logan explained.

Hearing this, and seeing as it wasn't a big deal anyway, Muka wore the mask, but even then, as everyone went to look at her, just with her eyes alone, there was something drawing about them.

It felt like one would do anything just to rip the bottom of the mask to see what the true face looked like under those eyes.

"Maybe I should get you some sunglasses as well," Logan said.

As Logan had predicted, the advertised event was a huge hit. People from far away places came to this event.

People had travelled from the Graylash planets, Pure's base, and the travellers even stopped hunting on other beast planets for this event.

This event was also a way to show that the human race was still part of one group, showing off the city and the Green family's strength. After all, they would all be doing battle with Logan's state of the art robots.

The rules were simple: participants would go up against the Black coloured robots and face them in certain waves.

Whoever got to the highest wave would win the grand prize, which was still a mystery to the whole world.

Logan made a large arena in the centre of Green City. With the help of his power, Logan can easily reconstruct certain objects based on his wishes.

And not long ago, he had found a way to supply himself with a bit more energy allowing him to use more MC cells when using his soul weapon.

Because of that, now stood above the ocean, with all of the apartment buildings and living areas moved to the side, was a large arena, and above the arena was an equally large projection live-streaming the event.

It was so high and huge, and people could view it irrespective of their apartment located in the Green city.

That way, the people could view the event without purchasing a ticket to the actual event. Logan knew that wealthy outsiders would mostly take all the prime seats.

Although he could save them for his people and such, he had learnt to deal with things more politically over the years, and his experience helped him greatly in such situations.

Perhaps this was a lesson he had learnt well from Sam. At the moment, people hadn't arrived to view the event yet.

That was because the participants or anyone who wished to enter were to arrive first.

Due to people arriving from all over, not everyone was exactly friendly to each other, and predicting that there would be a few scuffles here and there, it was always best to do this without the public.

Right now, all the participants were already in the underground area establishment below the arena. There were several lines and long queues for those that wished to enter.

At the end of the line were what looked like the Al robots themselves, although these were silver in colour rather than black.

"If you have your traveller code, please input it on the right for your details. If you would like to remain anonymous, then please request to do so." The robot asked each participant.

"Haha, I can't wait!" A large muscular man, who had beast gear on one of his knuckles, chuckled as he added, "I thought that this event might be worrisome, but it looks like there isn't anyone here who is even worth my time!!!"

The man said this out loud, clearly trying to rile up the other contestants. However, most kept their mouths shut because they knew the identity of this large man.

Greg. One of the AAA Ranked travellers. Not everyone entered thinking they had a chance to win, but because this wasn't a one on one event, they wanted to test themselves.

Meanwhile, at the front of one of the ques.,

"Sorry, I don't have a Traveller tag, but I don't want to enter anonymously either. Is there a way you could mainly input my name into the system?" The man asked.

"Sure, please type your name on the screen before you." The robot replied.

The man smiled, and his fingers typed down a name.

Quinn Talen.
