# Chapter 1650: How do we know it's you?

Seeing the cracks in Quinn's mask, it was clear to everyone that he must have been wearing some disguise. Because of this, the others were on guard, and Yaddy even braced himself to attack the intruder.

He had doubts about this vampire's identity, and his best guess was that the vampire in front of him must be one of the Red vampire leaders.

At the same time, all of those in the room, the other Lieutenants, including Mitchell, prepared themselves for the worst.

'He... is finally showing himself." Mitchell thought. "I might need to make a decision soon. If everyone decided to attack him at once and if Andy gives any order? Whose side do I take?" At that moment, he wanted to slap himself across the face.

He had already promised that he would be loyal to the new vampire. He had decided; whether it was the right one or the wrong one, he would soon find out.

Then there was Lucia. Ever since he had appeared on the 'Graylash' planet, she had a hunch that the person was someone else. When the mask pieces fell from Quinn's face, they started to evaporate before they could touch the floor. After all, they were part of Peter's power and were part of his soul weapon. Soon, his long flowing hair rolled down up to his waist, and his face was now that of a young man.

He no longer had as unremarkable features as before, and everyone in the room was taken aback by his handsome appearance. Never had they set their eyes on such a person in their life, and it was a reaction brought from within.

The person at the centre of everyone's attention had a flawless handsome face without even a single blemish. Now seeing who he was though, none of the vampires acted because they were confused for a second. "Who are you?!" Yaddy shouted as he brandished his blood aura.

"I am not here to attack you," Quinn replied.

"I have decided to reveal myself to you, so there are no secrets between us. Hopefully, you will all be willing to work alongside and tell me your secrets." Of course, Yaddy scoffed at this. No matter who he was, unless he was someone as great as Logan Green or Andy, no one would listen to him, even if he was the enemy.

"I guess I no longer have to disguise myself either. It is tiring keeping it up." Peter said while withdrawing his transformation skill.

They then saw a more pale figure appear, one with tighter skin on his face and more sunken dark eyeballs. The Peter they all could see now though, was more similar to what he looked like when transforming and using the celestial energy; in simple words, he looked a little more dead. For a second, after reverting to his original appearance, Peter turned and glanced at Lucia; he wanted to see her reaction.

Seeing Peter, the real Peter, she just smiled back. She had already gone beyond the point of caring what he and Quinn looked like. She just wanted to know if they were good people. Still, Lucia was confused.

The person she could see, the vampire she could see, wasn't one that she recognised, and she believed there was something she had overlooked.

"A strong Wight that can transform and an original Vampire, I am guessing? So are you going to tell me what family you lead then?" Andy asked, not really surprised by their appearances.

"You are wrong about the first guess," Quinn answered.

"But I am not an original vampire."

These words surprised a lot of them in the room. Mitchell, Lucia and Andy all thought without a doubt he had to be an original vampire.

"You have great strength; both of you do. I also assume that is your Wight by your side; if you are not an original vampire, you had to be a leader at least, correct?" Andy asked again, now a little more intrigued about the person in front of him.

"In the past... I had earned many titles. I was the leader of the Tenth family at one point, and later, I was also what was known as a Punisher and I guess at some point I became leader of the punishers."

There were strange faces being pulled as they processed what Quinn was saying. Some of his words made sense, and, at the same time, few didn't. They tried to think about the past, who were the Punishers, and what was the Tenth family.

"Well, there were a few other titles that people knew about me. At some point, I was the King of the vampires and the Cursed faction leader, but I guess these titles don't mean much since many have forgotten what the 'Cursed' faction is despite their sacrifices."

"My name is Quinn Talen... And from what I have seen recently, my name has become somewhat infamous while I was away." Saying these words, tears had almost streamed out of Mitchell's eyes.

Although he had heard this man say it once before, and he was unsure whether or not to believe him, hearing them this time, inexplicable emotions began to overcome him.


For Lucia, everything was starting to make sense, the amount of power he had displayed and why Zinon had gifted his armour to this man. However, there would always be those that didn't believe, and they had every right not to believe him.

"How dare you?!" Yaddy shouted, and he wasn't the only one. Many of the other lieutenants seemed to be angry with these words as well. They called remarks and were furious.

"How could you claim to be a great hero? That is a disgrace. We should toss him out!"

Of course, even with all the harsh remarks, not a single vampire had chosen to act on them because of what they had witnessed earlier. Andy stood up and walked up to the two of them. Everyone waited to hear what he had to say as he stopped a few metres short.

"I... I have great respect for the hero Quinn. There are many reasons behind this, and if you are who you say you are, then I wish to have a talk and a drink with you. I would do everything to help you as best as I could. I will happily tell you about Jessica and help you with whatever you need. However, if it turns out that you're lying..."

Andy paused, and with a smile, he added, "I'm going to chain your arms above you, then I'm going to flay your torso and pull it up over your head and tie it in. You're not going to bleed to death, and you're not going to die of shock. But the pain will cause you to vomit, and you will die choking on that."

This made Peter angry and he soon was going to interject until Quinn spoke.

"There is video footage from the fight with Graham, a worldwide broadcast. Zinon, the 'Graylash' family leader, used that to confirm my appearance. Many of the statues are of my previous look." Quinn stated, amused by Andy's words.

"Anyone could fake that!" Yaddy interrupted.

"Are you saying that anyone can fool the 'Graylash' family leader?" Mitchell shouted out, now speaking up for the one that he supported.

"And how do you explain his strength? You think a vampire would keep himself hidden this whole time?" Lucia spoke up as well, now supporting them, believing in Quinn's words.

If this was the Hero, maybe she could get the answers she had been waiting for.

"If you don't believe my words, then tell me, how can I prove myself to you?" Quinn asked.

By now, using a device on himself, Andy had already begun the video of the great battle. Everyone in the room had already seen it at one point or time in their lives. However, the Quinn captured in the video, mainly his appearance, was slightly different to what was in front of them.

For one, the red celestial power wasn't flowing through him like back then; this was the main reason why the video didn't wholly convince them. On top of that, they used disguises before, so how can the Vampire Corps believe that they aren't using another disguise now.

"...There is one way." Andy spoke after a long silence. "My father... my father can confirm who you are."

*****

# Chapter 1651: The orgins of the Vampire corps

Memories flashed through Quinn's mind at that moment. To prove who he was, Quinn thought that perhaps he would have to reveal his strength, show what exactly he could do and prove that he was the Hero that they all worshipped.

However, it was quite clear that even though he had performed feats that many alive today can't even fathom, they still refused to believe he was the exact figure from the previous millennia they idolised.

Just then, a thought came over Quinn: Maybe he could leverage this situation to get to Logan Green? Of course, there was also the chance that Logan wouldn't believe that he was Quinn, but there were so many incidents from the past, which if Quinn spoke about, only a few would know, including Logan, and that would let them ascertain who he was.

On top of that, there was one thing that only Logan Green could do, and that was to access his system. This was something he could do with a simple touch and something only the Green family ability had an advantage of.

"Are you saying that your father is someone that knows me?" Quinn asked, still surprised by this fact, he wasn't expecting to meet someone from his time so early, "If that is the case, they would have to be as old as I am."

There seemed to be strange expressions on the people in the room. Someone had raised eyebrows, a few were whispering, and others were frowning. It turned out that even the lieutenants, along with the others, were unsure of just who Commander Andy was talking about.

"It is a big risk," Andy said.

"I can't just let anyone see my father, and just so you know, he no longer has anything to do with the Vampire Corps unit. He will only appear to confirm whether you are the Hero or not. Are you willing to accept?"

There was a pause before Quinn answered. It was mainly due to him wondering who he would meet, but the others took this as a lack of confidence.

"Ha, look at this; you have scared him straight. No one would have ever thought that there was still a vampire alive who would remember how and what the Hero actually looked like." Yaddy scoffed, enjoying this moment.

At first, Yaddy hid his displeasure against the new vampire, but now it seemed like he was making it clear that he didn't like Quinn. He felt confident as the other lieutenants also considered this person a liar.

"Agreed, it would be nice meeting someone who knew me," Quinn answered. "If possible, do you mind telling me your father's name?"

Taking a medium-sized vessel, the group was on the move, with half of the lieutenants, including Mitchell. Originally he wasn't one of the selected ones, but Quinn insisted he come with them.

Andy wanted to take the lieutenants with him because he also wanted to update everyone on the current events that he had learned of so far.

At the same time, Mars couldn't just be left defenceless, although he had good reason to believe that the dhampirs wouldn't cause a stir or attack the Vampire Corps base anytime soon.

Everyone was aboard the ship travelling to reach where Andy's father was. Andy has told them that they would have to leave the planet Mars. Quinn was hoping they would be heading to Earth, but that didn't seem to be the case.

As the ship was on autopilot and voyaging to its destination, the group had gathered in the command centre, where one could gaze at the dark view of space.

"I said I would tell you who my father is once we begin the journey."

Andy broke the silence, "Originally, many of those in the Vampire Corps believed that I was the one who made the Vampire Corps unit. That is because every vampire in the unit has only ever known me as their leader and although I am old, I am not the leader of the original Vampire Corps."

"What are you saying? You are documented as the only leader of the Vampire Corps," Mitchell spoke up, confused by what he was hearing.

"I guess, technically, I am the only leader of the Vampire Corps. Andy chuckled, realising his words may have confused the former, "But long ago, the Vampire Corps were known as something else: The Vampire Soldiers, which is the true origin of the Vampire Corps unit. If you are who you say you are, you should know about them, yes?"

Quinn knew who the Vampire Soldiers were, so he happily answered.

"After a thousand years, perhaps what you and I know might be different. However, the Vampire Soldiers were initially a unit belonging to Earth's military, and they were human beings led by a man named Paul."

"His men were captured by the vampires and turned by them. Eventually, Paul died, and the unit was led by a vampire named Ashley. Since they were trained as soldiers but turned vampires, we called them the Vampire Soldiers."

The others then turned their heads to look at Andy to see if he had a response. Everyone was still trying to figure out if this was the real Hero or not.

"Indeed, what I know and you know is slightly different, and I can not confirm what you say is true, at least not yet," Andy replied.

"All I know is that a group of vampires had agreed to work with what was then known as the Earthborn group, and these were the Vampire Soldiers."

Quinn could guess perhaps why, in the end, all of those Vampire Soldiers had family members in the Earthborn group.

Quinn had promised that he would try to find a way to turn them back into a would try to find a way to turn them back into a human, but he never did, having gone asleep for millennia. It didn't seem like any one of them would be alive today, or maybe one of them did survive.

"The relation between the vampires and the humans was starting to develop, it wasn't always as hostile as it is now. The Vampire Soldiers also expanded in numbers, mainly because of three people."

"The leader of the Vampire Soldiers at the time, and then my mother and father, Fex and Samantha."

Hearing these names, a warm feeling came over Quinn, and he couldn't help but smile. Others thought this smile was fake, but when Andy noticed it, for some reason, he instantly knew it was Quinn's genuine reaction, and this made him smile back.

"Those two, I hope they both had a happy life, and it looks like I will be getting to see you again, Blood Brother" Quinn thought.

"The ties increased dramatically when my father and mother joined. My father held great prestige among the vampires, and as more vampires enlisted the Vampire Soldiers it eventually led to the founding of a unit within the military composed of only vampires.

Then, my mother was someone who was vampires, someone who was incredibly trusted by the humans as well."

"My father introduced his family ability, that of the thirteenth family, to the Vampire Soldiers and familiarised them with the String ability. However, relations between the vampire and humans didn't exactly seem to stay the way they were. Which is why the Vampire Corps came into existence, but honestly, it was just a reorganization of roles within the military of Earth, something that was done to please the humans and masses at the time.

We still have a good relationship with Earth, and wish to keep it that way while also trying to fight our own battles and protect our own kind."

There were a lot of questions that Quinn wanted to ask Andy. How Fex was, what he had done, what happened to his mother and more, but since they were already heading to see the person in question, Quinn thought it would be best to ask Fex himself.

"How did the relations between vampires and humans turn sour? Was it a dhampir attack or something internal?" Quinn wondered.

At the same time, Yaddy and the other generals were just waiting for the act on this vampire to slip.

Andy continued to walk forward, and eventually, they entered a dark room. It was well furnished with different paintings, treasures, beast armour, etc. The whole place looked more like a museum.

"What is your father doing in a place like this?" Peter eventually asked since it was so secluded from all signs of life. Turning around, Andy looked at all of them.

"My father is resting. He went into eternal slumber."

*****

# Chapter 1652: Blood brothers forever!

There was a strange feeling brewing inside of Quinn. Despite having been told that more than a thousand years had passed since his fight with Graham, and even having seen a lot that has changed, there had always been something surreal about that information.

Perhaps it had been due to the fact that overall things didn't seem to have changed too drastically, technology not having advanced to a degree that he would be unfamiliar with, or the fact that Peter had still been by his side the moment he had woken...

Whatever the case, only now that he stood here, having been told that one of his best friends would need to be awoken from his eternal slumber, did he really start to grasp the meaning of a millennium having passed.

"I was a little too hopeful... huh." Quinn thought to himself. "Just because I saw Vicky recently and have been told that Logan is still alive, it doesn't mean that all of them will be as well... I have been foolish..."

Fex was an incredibly young vampire at the time and although a vampire's lifespan was far longer than a although a vampire's lifespan was far longer than a human's, it was rare for any of them to live that long. Perhaps only an Original would have been able to last that long without eternal slumber.

"You seem a little sad." Andy noted, his voice echoing a bit in the room.

"So much has happened while I was away..." Quinn slowly admitted. "It's a little hard to process it all." Fex had been the closest thing to a real brother the vampire had ever had, and he wasn't quite sure if he was ready to see him as an old man.

"Is only your father here? What about your mother, and where are the rest of the Cursed faction?" Hearing these words, a small smile appeared on Andy's face.

"Ah yes, the Cursed faction. As a small child my parents had often told me the stories about it... although I supposed this was also the case in my latter years. These days I might be one of the few people who still remember them."

"As I stated before, the relationship between vampires and the rest grew after the defeat of the Dalki. With the big threat looming over everyone's head gone, separate factions weren't really needed."

"Those in the Cursed faction began to live their own, lives doing their own thing."

"According to my parents, the end of the Cursed faction was a good thing in a sense, though. Usually when a group is made and the leader disappears, they are replaced. However, with their leader having sacrificed himself to save everyone, nobody felt that it was right for somebody else to take over."

"As the one who had gathered all of them together, they regarded all deeds done by the Cursed faction as something truly done by the Hero Quinn Talen. So the right person was getting all the credit they deserve anyway, so why would they complain."

Quinn couldn't believe how he had managed to truly gather a group of selfless people like that. Listening to Andy's account, a giant weight was lifted off his shoulder. He had been worried that the Cursed faction might have been hunted or killed off.

This outcome was for the best. At least the others might have managed to live a happy life.

"My father and mother had me quite late in their lifetime, even though I am quite old."

"During their later years, they wished to experience real life, so after I was grown up and well, the two of them had planned to go into a deep sleep together."

"With my mother being a type of undead similar to me, our lives are close to being immortal, as long as we eat, but my mother wished to pass with her husband. That was how much they loved each other."

It was then that the look in Andy's eyes changed a bit, and he clenched his fist while speaking the second part, turning away from the others, so they could no longer see his face.

"However, before they could do so my mother was killed in an attack by the Dhampirs. Ever since my father had spent his time in the hopes of one day getting revenge on her killer... Unfortunately, he never succeeded."

"Over the decades, I watched him grow weaker and older, to the point when he retired, having me take over. For a long time he refused to go into eternal slumber... until he had no other choice."

Walking to the end of the room, Andy pulled out a knife.

"Before I finally put him to sleep, he asked me for several favors: to hunt the one who killed my mother and to see the Hero Quinn Talen."

He was convinced that one day he would return, and in that case I was to bring him over.

"My father's life is hanging by a thread. I'm not even sure he has the energy to enter another eternal slumber after waking up if he were to stay out for long, so when i tell you i'm taking a big risk in doing this, I'm not joking. If there was another way, i would prefer doing that, yet as his son, i wish to respect my father's wishes."

"I sincerely hope that you are who you claim to be. If not..."

Andy left the threat hanging and before Quinn could say anything, the Commander made a cut on his arm and blood started to drip onto the floor. The Celestial Vampire had seen this before, as the blood slowly started to fill the specially made dial on the ground, turning slightly red.

A sound was made as the top part started to lift off the ground and small pockets of air were escaping from the strange mechanism. The pod-like chambers that were used to keep vampires in eternal slumber were in front of them. The vampire that would descend could only be awoken by the same bloodline and even though Andy wasn't a vampire, he still had Fex's blood running through his vampire veins.

The chamber started to swivel around its front door and slowly a figure could be seen standing up right with his hands over his chest. Other Lieutenants in the room stood to the side, as did General Yaddy. After hearing how Commander Andy did all of this in accordance with his father's wishes, they felt like they had no right to directly stand in front of this person.

All of them went to the side of the room. Seeing this, Lucia and Minny followed suit. Peter was about to move as well until Quinn grabbed him on the shoulder.

"No, you stay. You were Fex's friend as well, we all were." Quinn muttered, not looking away from the vampire who arose.

The Wight noticed his friend gripping tightly.

Although Peter didn't really feel pain, he could still feel the pressure. He understood why Quinn was so emotional.

The one in front of them was Fex... even though he wasn't the one they remembered.

No longer young and lustre, his face was now filled with wrinkles. Fex's hair had gone completely white, almost resembling his sister's. His body seemed smaller than back then and it looked far frailer since his muscles had long since started to fade.

Nevertheless, one thing hadn't changed. His hair was still combed back, like the both of them remembered it.

Finally, the vampire in the chamber opened his eyes revealing a faint red glow. In front of him, the first thing he saw was Andy. "Father, it has been a long time." Andy greeted him and immediately went to his side, offering him his arm as a support.

"Hey, will you look at that?" Fex spoke, in an old and wise voice, as he went to touch his son's massive arms. "You're nearly as muscular as I was back then, though you're only half as good-looking." Andy joined him in his dry laugh.

"Now tell me, why did you wake this old man up? Do you bring good news? Did you finally manage to kill the one... the one that...!" Although Fex didn't finish his words, his faint eyes shone brighter, as he thought about his wife's killer.

"No, I woke you up due to the promise I made you." Andy corrected, as he stepped to the side, no longer blocking his father's view. Both vampires looked at each other for a while, neither one capable of finding the right words. Everyone in the room was nervous and wondering what would happen next.

A tear was running down Quinn's cheeks as he opened his mouth to break the silence.

"I'm sor..."

"DON'T YOU DARE SAY THAT!!!" Fex shouted as loud as he could, his words echoing through the room with an energy which didn't seem to fit his appearance. "No... not you...you should never, EVER have to say those words! If one person has ever earned the right to never say those words to anyone ever, that's you!"

"At the very least you should never have to tell them to me... I don't know how long it has been, but let me speak first." Fex gulped down his emotions and cleared his throat. He then gestured to Andy to let go of him, so he could stand on his own.

"I missed you, Brother!" Fex smiled.

*****

# Chapter 1653: They are yours!

Vampire leaders tended to enter into eternal slumber before reaching their peak age. There were many possible reasons as to why they chose to do it. Be it because they believed that they had accomplished everything they could hope for, or because they felt that it was time for a new generation to decide the vampires future.

Vincent Eno's theory on the matter, however, was an entirely different one. He had stipulated that the reason they would make that choice was a lot less selfless, and rather quite selfish. It was something vampires would do... out of fear.

As a long-living species, they were blessed with a few centuries in which they would continuously grow stronger, yet it was inevitable that at some point the ravages of time would turn against them. Instead of growing weaker with each passing day, they would much rather be remembered as the bastions of strength each one of them represented. As such, it was quite rare for a vampire to actually look the way Fex did now... seeing him so weak before him just pained Quinn. He couldn't help but imagine how much pain his friend must have been through while he had been asleep, completely oblivious to the loss his blood brother had suffered.

He was so sorry for not being there, to help him grief over his loss. He could even tell the anger he had from his voice when speaking about losing his wife Samantha. If only he had been there, he might have been able to prevent that misery from occurring. Of course, with Fex being one of his closest friends, he had practically read the other's thoughts, so he had immediately stopped his blood brother from uttering nonsense.

Quinn was someone who had not only saved his life, as well as that of countless others, but he had also selflessly risked his own life time and time again to literally save humanity and the vampires. The person in front of him had managed to accomplish so much in two short decades than others would have in multiple lifetimes.

After all that he had been through, the worst thing he, as friend, could do, would be to make him feel guilty, especially for something which has happened when he must have been recuperating. "I knew that you would come back one day." Fex said, a lone tear dropping from his face.

"Even after all those centuries, I knew that there would come a day when I would see you again. I would have loved to be there for when it happened... but I never knew you that would be THAT heavy of a sleeper, Quinn." Fex joked, making a small smile appear on his friend's face.

"I'm glad, my boy listened to his old man and allowed me to see you one more time." The old vampire hit his son on the back a couple of times, who rubbed the place, even though the pats barely had any power behind them.

"I wish we could talk for a long time, I wish I could tell you everything that happened while you were gone, to reminisce with you about the good old days..."

"Unfortunately, as you can see, I was a bit too foolish in my old days. I can tell that I don't have a lot of time to talk, so please allow me to be selfish and be the one to do all the talking."

Quinn wanted to interject there, there was a lot he wanted to say to Fex, but with his new powers the Celestial Vampire knew exactly what the other was talking about. The red vampire aura surrounding his blood brother was barely there. His outburst earlier had diminished the little wisp even more. Although, Quinn was thinking if there were other ways he could maybe solve the problem.

"He must have really waited till the last second before entering an eternal slumber, and now he's using his last moments to talk to me... I need to respect that."

"I hate to admit it, but for once you might actually be the more handsome one from the two of us. Perhaps you are similar to the Originals." Fex chucked.

"I don't know how long you've been awake or how much time has passed, but if the world is still in the same state as it was when I left then allow me to apologise. I never wanted you to see it like this."

"After the ten years had passed and there was no sign of you coming back, all of us split up. Each one of us set out to make a chance, to help. create a perfect world you would have been proud of to have given your life for. Everyone from the Cursed Faction did what they thought was best with you in mind. I truly believe that, so take that as you will. I can only hope that at least one of us succeeded."

"In my case, after marrying Samantha, we took care of the Vampire Soldiers, and together with Ashley we created what later became the Vampire Corps unit. Seeing my son with you, I assume that means that they still exist.

"As you can see, I can't really help you myself any more, but fortunately I can offer you a different kind of help. I've already instructed Andy that in case you would ever return, he is to hand over the command over them. In return, I only have a single favour and I realise that it's a giant one, but you might be the only one who can fulfil it. I beg you, Quinn, please kill Erin! Avenge my Samantha!"

[Optional Quest received]

[An old friend has made a request?]

[Upon accepting the Quest, you will receive the following rewards:]

[Reward: Leader of the Vampire Corps unit (Title)]

[Task: Kill the Dhampir Queen]

Quinn had listened to Fex's plea wholeheartedly, and it seemed like he had developed a true hatred for Erin now. It was also the second time he had heard her being referred to as the Dhampir Queen.

It made him realise that she really had gone too far, she was no longer one of the friends that he had grown up with.

On top of that, to learn what the Cursed faction had become failing his return, that the people closest to him had set out to spread good was good to hear, though it saddened him at the same time. Not having a family growing up had been painful for Quinn. He had missed out on that, and what was painful now was that he himself had left the replacement family he had created...

And yet, none of them had blamed him for it. Instead, they had responded in kind, doing grand gestures for him like these. "It looks like you have said everything you wanted to say." Quinn replied.

"I can tell that every second you're out here must be painful for you. So please, enjoy the rest of your time, my friend... no, my brother." Quinn corrected himself.

"I want you to rest in peace, knowing that I will do everything to fulfil your request."

[Optional Quest accepted]

[Quest reviewed: Kill the Dhampir Queen]

[Reward: Leader of the Vampire Corps unit (Title) (Error)]

[Although the original creator wishes to hand over the Vampire Corps to you, the people within the Vampire Corps do not accept you. Prove to the people, to your future subordinates that you deserve to be their leader]

"Huh, I thought as much... it seems even if Fex wishes it and originally created it for me, it isn't something I can just take over. Either way, I don't want him to know about this."

"Please rest, and perhaps one day I might find a way to wake you up again without it being so painful for you... because I too would love nothing more than to listen to you tell me everything that happened during my absence and to reminisce with you about the good old days..." Quinn replied.

With his Celestial Powers not yet at its full potential, and not having reached level 10, Quinn didn't know what he was capable of, so maybe this was within his powers. At least, he hoped so. He had thought about trying to make him become a Dedicated Follower in hopes of rejuvenating him, but that wouldn't be fair towards his blood brother. He wasn't someone that he could treat as a guinea pig.

Besides, the old vampire had already lived a full life, yet his obsession to get revenge on his wife's killer had left him in his current state. Even if it would work, it would most likely lead him down a dark path, and in the worst case scenario he might lose his for real... No, letting him continue down this path would only be selfish. Not to mention, Quinn was certain that even if he did offer him that choice, Fex would decline it. As such, Quinn vowed to himself that when the time came for him to end his own journey, he would come back and the two could share their tales together.

With all that was needed said, Quinn walked toward Fex, and carefully gave him a giant hug. The two embraced each other, and the Celestial Vampire could feel how light his friend's body felt. After that, Fex returned to the chamber, and Andy performed the ritual to allow his father to enter his eternal slumber once more.

"Peter!" Fex spoke with a weak voice. "Thank you for watching over him... Please stay with him, in my stead!"

Finally, the chamber was closed, and Fex was resting once again, leaving the whole room silent. No one knew what to say, it was just that unbelievable.

The emotion in all of their words, Quinn and Fex had spoken to each other as if no one else was in the room. They had ignored everything around them, aware that those might perhaps be their last time talking to each other.

Without a doubt, though, the biggest shock that was taking time for them to process was that the person who had claimed to be Quinn Talen hadn't lied. Nobody dared to doubt the confirmation from someone who had been there on that fateful day.

Now that the great Hero Quinn they had all learned about, studied and thought of as something akin to a God was in front of them, none of them knew how they were meant to act towards him.

To top it all off, everyone in the room were high ranking members of the Vampire Corps. Could they really adhere to the wishes of their founder? All eyes shifted to Andy, then to Quinn, waiting for him to say something.

*****

# Chapter 1654: I'm not a Hero.

Everyone was left full of thoughts after witnessing the meeting of two brothers after millennia. They slowly processed the information, and at the same time, they were afraid to say something. In the end, what could they even say? And eventually, Quinn was the one who broke the ice.

"I am Quinn Talen." Quinn addressed everyone in the room. He wasn't shouting, but it was loud enough so that everyone could hear him.

"That is all I am. That is just a name given to me by my parents, whom I don't even know very well.

I know, to all of you, that name means a lot, but to me, it's just a mere name. I never thought I would be called a hero. I never planned any of this to happen. I was doing everything for those I deeply cared about. Waking up... a thousand years later, it is the same world? No, but I still want to look after and know what happened to those my friends and everyone else whom I care about."

After hearing Quinn out, the others, bit by bit, truly understood how Hero Quinn had lived in the past. From the tales he had heard, there wasn't much known about Quinn to the general populace. A person a vampire that seemingly had great strength and he had come out of nowhere for the world. Nearly no one knew about his past.

This was even more of a reason why they felt like he was a god to them all, but they realised now, seeing the actual person, that he was someone just like them... a normal person.

"I... I am thankful for everything you have done, and I am so happy to see a smile on my father's face." Andy said, already bowing and standing on one knee. It looked like he had more to say, but before he could, there was one person who had chosen to speak out.

"What are you doing, commander?!" Yaddy shouted out loud.

His face was covered in sweat. Right now, his mind was going through panic mode. He had betted everything that this person wasn't who he claimed to be, and even now, he couldn't fully believe that was the case.

Either way, he was reacting as such to save himself. Yaddy had been so vocally against Quinn that he knew he would be done for, if Andy really gave the Vampire Corps unit to him. In fact, even if Andy remained in his position, he would still be done for, so there was only one thing he could do.

"How do we know?!" Yaddy tried to reason, "How do we know the vampire didn't use some strong influence skill to trick your father?"

At that moment, Yaddy felt something pull him from under his legs, and in the next instant, something dragged his body across the floor, and he was directly in front of Andy.

Before Yaddy could understand what happened, Andy moved his first and threw a punch at the former's face, only to stop it just short of hitting Yaddy's face.

A large gust of wind flapped Yaddy's cheeks, and he could do nothing but gulp.

"How dare you say that someone can trick my father while we were all here?" Andy gritted his teeth as he said these words. "We all saw he used no such trick, and do you really think anyone can fool my father?"

"You are indeed a man who only cares about himself and his position. I was an idiot for not seeing through you and promoting you to such a post!"

"If it weren't for the fact that this is my father's resting place, my fist would have gone right through your head!"

If there was one other thing everyone could be sure about, it was that Andy deeply cared for his father and his father's wishes.

"Make sure to keep an eye on him, relieve him of his position. I will find a replacement for him during the meeting later today." Andy ordered the lieutenants.

Yaddy was simply too stunned even to act or move anymore, and he got even more frightened as two lieutenants stepped forward, lifted him off the ground and took him to the side of the room. While this was happening, Mitchell's eyes hadn't left Quinn for even a moment.

"I can't believe it... he was telling the truth... this whole time. I knew he was something special, and I needed to follow him, but for him to actually be Quinn Talen... I have no regrets about what I have done."

Mitchell felt immensely relieved and proud of his intuition. Turning his head, Quinn glanced over at Mitchell and smiled as if he knew what the latter was thinking. Quinn didn't really want to hide who he was, and he was honest from the beginning, but he knew there would be plenty that would have a hard time believing it.

"Quinn, if you please let me speak." Andy respectively bowed, and of course, Quinn nodded back.

"I wish I could welcome you with a great celebration, I wish I could tell the whole world of your return and I wish I could hand over the Vampire Corps unit to you as my father wished."

There was hesitancy before saying his following few words and based on the quest details he saw earlier, Quinn knew that there would be problems.

"But I'm afraid it wouldn't be the best thing to do. How many people do you think would believe Quinn Talen had returned? Even with my word I can't convince the masses out there. The Vampire Corps would think something went wrong if I suddenly said you are now in charge of the vampire corps."

"However, if there is anything you need help with, you can ask me and I will do everything to help you. At the same time, as for telling everyone of your return... the others will think it's a hoax, or maybe we're trying to trick them."

"Something like this can get the whole 'Graylash' planets and other neutral factions dragged into this whole mess again and this can even trigger a war against the Pure and the Dhampirs."

"It would give the red vampires a clear position to attack, or if we claimed you were Quinn, it might even make those red vampire fanatics attack us as well for saying such things. There are too many reasons why we can't announce your return."

"Do you think that really matters?" Peter replied.

"I don't think you understand. Quinn doesn't need to prove who he is. He just said he never wanted to be a hero. The simple truth is you don't have to tell anyone that we have come back."

"If there is a problem or someone disagrees, we will just deal with it ourselves. If we wanted the Vampire Corps, even if you didn't wish to give it to us like you just said, we could simply kill everyone in this room and you wouldn't even be able to see it coming."

Hearing those words left most of the other lieutenants uneasy. Many of them had only seen a fraction of Quinn's power, and now that they had verified Quinn's identity, they fully well believed Peter's threat and knew the latter wasn't joking around.

"It's alright, Peter. We don't need the Vampire Corps, and I never planned on using them the way you think. Quinn smiled, and then turning his head towards Andy, he spoke, "Andy, I only have a few requests, and if you can help me get them done, that will be more than enough for me."

Quinn paused for a moment, and as Andy lightly nodded, he added, "First, I wish to go to Earth with you, and then, I want you to set up a meeting with Logan Green if possible. You can tell him who I am or do whatever you think is best."

After saying these words, Quinn was trying to gauge a reaction once again, and it looked like Andy had no problem with that request.

"Second, there is a little ritual I would like you to incorporate into the Vampire Corps Unit. This ritual is crucial, and the vampires throughout all the Vampire Corps bases must adhere to it."

This request raised an eyebrow, but Andy first wanted to hear about the details. "The third request I have is access to the information you have on the Red vampires and the Dhampirs."

Upon hearing this one, Andy looked displeased because he didn't really want Quinn acting on his own and causing more trouble. His father might have been close to Quinn, trusted him and knew who he was, but to Andy, he was still a stranger, and his father's wishes would only take him so far.

Quinn didn't mind the latter's reaction and revealed his final request.

"Lastly, you need to tell me about Jessica and why she's so important."

*****

# Chapter 1655: You are not the same!

The whole group soon returned to the ship on which they had come to the small planet, and they were now returning to Mars. Although this time, there was one thing different: General Yaddy was tied up by Andy's red string, which was much stronger compared to the others. In fact, it was strong enough even to hold down a vampire lord like Yaddy, who looked to have tried to escape from it multiple times.

Currently, Quinn and Andy had put him in a separate room onboard the ship.

"It was something found out about the thirteenth family's ability many years after the war." Andy explained the string ability, "Before, everyone thought infusing our blood aura with the string was the best way to harden it."

"Although this does work, it means a vampire would have to have a powerful blood aura to have their strings more practical against enemies like a Demigod tier beasts, Demon tier beasts and vampires like that guy. Later, we also found out that the string's natural strength was actually related to our own. The stronger the user is, the more powerful their string ability will be."

Quinn subconsciously glanced at Andy's biceps were large and bulging even in a relaxed state.

"I guess that's why your string is incredibly strong, being that you're a Colossal Draugr," Quinn commented.

Andy was stumped upon hearing Quinn's words. How could someone else know what he was? In truth, even he himself didn't know what subclass he was. He just knew that he had surpassed his mother in terms of evolution and it was the first time he had heard the words Colossal Draugr.

Still, he said nothing as he had to remind himself just what great person was standing next to him. Heading back to the command centre, Andy had called a meeting. It was more official compared to the talk they had. last time.

It seemed like he was in a rush of some sort. Even when coming to see his father, he stated the lieutenants were brought along so he could update them on the way about an important upcoming event and also about Jessica. The latter was why Quinn agreed to board the ship, because he wanted to know the truth regarding Jessica.

As soon as Quinn and Andy stepped in, everyone stood up from their seats and bowed down.

"It's okay, guys. Please take a seat." Andy ordered.

A few chose to sit down, as they usually would have done after Andy said those words, but that's when Quinn and the others noticed something out of the ordinary.

A few of the lieutenants remained standing, and one of them was Mitchell.

"It would be rude to sit down before the great hero does," Mitchell spoke, smiling and making sure his eyepatch was properly fitted. Hearing this, Quinn smiled.

"Please sit down."

It had set a little strange mood for the meeting as the lieutenants looked at each other. It was clear that there was already a split between the lieutenants: those who thought they should be following the Hero Quinn and those who still believed Andy was in charge.

"I guess this is what Andy was talking about. In a way, it proves that he was right. Even after seeing me in person, not everyone would be willing to believe. Although this wouldn't just cause the others to attack, a split in the vampire corps or the public is possible. However, if I pick and choose people who know that I am back and who don't, things will be much more under control." Quinn thought.

"Before we discuss the matters of Jessica, there is something else that need to announce. When I get to earth, I will send out a notice about what I am about to say to all the other bases." Andy explained. "In the last meeting, it was... loosely agreed that the dhampirs would be attacking the red vampires. Apparently, they have found one of the red vampire leaders."

"They have said that they won't be touching the vampire corps bases and areas or the red vampires currently hiding within these bases. In turn, we are not to attack them and give them aid when required to."

"However we are not directly taking part in taking down the red vampires."

"This is not cooperation and I need to make that clear. However, with the dhampirs being so confident, who knows what they might try to do after attacking the red vampires. They will have to be confident in their strength if they think they can take on the red vampires and not be afraid of someone attacking them from behind. Maybe that's why they informed us of their plans, so we would seem like the villains to the public, or perhaps it's because they are confident that even if we attacked them they could defend themselves from any attack."

If there was one thing Quinn learnt, it was that all major factions seemed to be against the Red vampires. The latter made the Vampire Corps look bad, and ultimately their goal was completely contrary to the dhampirs.

The others looked a bit worried about this, but they knew Andy had made the decision and there wasn't much they could do. In the first place, the values that the Vampire Corps has taught them were to not attack but defend and protect those they cared about.

"As for why I am reporting this now, it's because it is partially linked to our Jessica problem." Andy spoke and paused for a second as he was unsure how to really explain what was going on.

Lucia's heart thumbed louder as she started to think.

"What is it? Is it because Jessica is the first hybrid Dhampir? But what does this have to do with them? Or maybe she is a secret weapon that the vampire corps have been developing."

"You see... Jessica herself is not of much importance, and I don't mean this in a bad way, but she is just a normal member of the vampire corps admittedly with unique characteristics of her eyes." Andy explained.

"Jessica not of importance?" Lucia raised an eyebrow. This certainly wasn't what she thought.

"It's her position that is of importance or her role. Because of her unique position, she gained the attention of a certain someone and that someone had proposed to her. She knew of the importance of this group and had agreed to the marriage… however it looks like she either got cold feet or maybe doesn't wish to go through with the marriage at all."

"So... Jessica got hurt just because she doesn't want to marry some stinky old man!" Minny shouted across the table.

Usually, such interruptions wouldn't be allowed at the meeting, but since Minny was next to Quinn, no one dared to say a word.

"Perhaps you have explained it as simply as possible. The problem is who this stinky person is." Andy smiled. "Earth is in a tough battle against the dhampirs. The Green family and the Vampire corps are strong forces, but Pure and the Dhampirs are strong as well and we need all the help we can get. As for another strong party helping us so far… they are known as the Chained."

"They are humans with strong abilities, some of them are more powerful than any of us can even imagine. They have abilities that aren't shared with others. The man that proposed to Jessica was the leader of the Chained. This marriage was meant to bring the vampire Corps and the chained closer together. This is why we need to find Jessica; otherwise, it will cause a huge problem for us."

Peter began to shake his head because he knew exactly how Quinn would have felt about this.

"Is this how the vampire corps, no, the leader of the vampire corps operate? Forcing people to do things against their will for your own benefit."

"You don't understand, the sacrifice for one is to help the many, and we need the strength of the Chained. Times are different, Quinn." Andy stated.

"No," Quinn replied. "Times aren't different at all. Do you think nothing like this happened in the past? I can already tell by the way you're talking that if I advised you to support Jessica to call off this wedding, you wouldn't agree to it. But I want you to know something: if your father was here, he wouldn't have acted helpless and he wouldn't have allowed for such a thing."

Peter knew this type of situation was coming because even in the past, when Quinn wasn't a prominent figure, and he had to go against the whole vampire settlement and the Blade family, on his own, he had done so. He had done this type of thing many times before.

"Are you trying to stir up my feelings?" Andy said, staring directly into Quinn's eye and the others felt like a fight was about to happen any second aboard the ship. "Mentioning my father and what he would have done. My father is not perfect; he made plenty of mistakes. Just because I care about him doesn't mean I agree with everything he has ever done!"

"No," Quinn said. "I was never going to ask for your help in getting Jessica out of this situation and I just wanted to know about her situation. My point was, in fact I would have never asked for help from your father either because I wouldn't have needed to. He would have helped me no matter what."

Standing up, Quinn didn't want to hear anymore as Andy's words had soured his mood.

"Just get me a ship to Earth, and I'll talk to the Chained. You can at least do that much, can't you?"

*****

# Chapter 1656: Correct out Wrongs
1656 - Correct out Wrongs

Andy felt like he was standing between the devil and the deep sea. Whatever he was going to do now, it would be his loss. Not too long ago, he had sworn that he would be happy to help Quinn using the vampire Corps by all means.

The only thing was, Andy never thoug| would try to go against the Chained head-on. Perhaps using the Corps members to search for people, or aid them in their fight while Andy still kept command over everything, was what he had expected.

Yet, for some reason, it was clear that Quinn held an attachment to a vampire whom he couldn't have known for long. Clenching his fists, Andy was even prepared to do something he never thought he would do if he were to meet the hero Quinn.

"If I do get you a vessel to go to Earth...what are you planning to do? I know you plan to see the Chained, but what will you ask of them?" He asked, controlling his frustration.

"That's simple. I will tell them who I am and request them to let Jessica be the judge of her own fate. If she wants to go through with this marriage, then it's up to her, but if not, then I will support her decision against whatever that entails." Quinn shrugged his shoulders, but he was clearly stating he would fight them or use force if necessary.

Silence descended the meeting room as Andy took time to think, and at that moment, Luci was struggling as well.

'I wonder, do the Chained know about Jessica? Is it because of what she really is? Maybe that's why the Chained want to keep her so bad, not just because their leader is obsessed with her. Does everyone here know of this?' Thinking about it, Lucia wondered if she should inform everyone.

It was quite possible that if the vampire corps knew about this, they might change their mind about handing Jessica over so willingly.

"Fine." Andy eventually spoke, which came as a surprise to the other Lieutenants. They knew how hard Andy had worked behind the scenes for this relationship with the Chained. Quinn wasn't the only one who wanted to break off this relationship, Andy himself didn't like this, but he was trying to see the bigger picture.

"I will grant you permission to enter the Earth. You can head to the Corps base located there. From there, the staff will prepare the ship for you, and then they will give the location of the Chained. I only have one request: in return for all this, you must declare that none of your actions has anything to do with the Vampire corps, that this is completely your doing." Andy's clear voice ran throughout the room.Quinn wasn't sure if he was looking too deep into Andy's words, but he wondered if this request had a double meaning. Perhaps he was stating that if he were to do him this favour, Quinn should forget trying to become the leader of the vampire crops.

After all, if Quinn really did become the leader of the vampire crops, all his actions would certainly be treated as their responsibilities.

"About my other request from before, will they still be followed," Quinn asked, wondering if they were on the same wavelength. Although Quinn wasn't friends with Andy, the vampire Corps were a yield from Fex.

In the end, their goal and what they were doing was exemplary. Just because they didn't do this one thing how he would have done didn't make them bad people or a sinister organisation.

Andy nodded. It looked like Quinn had received his answer.

"Wait!" Mitchell suddenly stood up. Putting his hand on the emblem stitched to his shirt, he soon ripped it off and placed it on the table. "I have decided to resign from the vampire corps...and Quinn Talen. I wish to follow you."Hearing this, Quinn smiled. Of course, he would welcome Mitchell. The latter had proved himself to be more than loyal, and it was to the point where Quinn was thinking of making him a dedicated follower-increasing the latter's strength.

However, he knew that this perhaps would put Andy in a difficult situation. After seeing the first person leave, maybe some other lieutenants might choose to go and follow the Hero. Mitchell walked over to Quinn, who gently nodded, indicating he didn't mind travelling with them.

What was surprising was that no one else had done the same thing. Only Mitchell was the one who resigned. If it was only one lieutenant, Andy didn't have a problem with letting him go. As for why no one else chose to leave, including those that seemed to support and welcome Quinn's return as leader of the corps, it was simply too risky.

Right now, Quinn was on his own, and he had no support from the current great powers in the world. Even now, he needed Andy's help to get to Earth since there were no teleporters anymore. The lieutenants also had their families dependent on them; they were a source of income and safety.

Leaving with Hero Quinn was a huge risk that promised little benefits to them. Their life was good, and no need for them to go on an adventure. Mitchell always thought his life had a purpose. That's why he developed skills to protect others around him.

These days, his left eye was pricking, and perhaps he was a superstitious person, but he believed that a change was coming and needed to be on the correct side of it.

There was little time before their ship would land back on Mars, and not to make the situation awkward or the tensions any higher, those travelling with Quinn had left the command room and would stay in their rooms, leaving the others to discuss stay in their rooms, leaving the others to discuss their own matters.

Just before leaving, Peter had a few words to say to Andy as the others went on ahead.

"I'm not the smartest guy," Peter said. "However, I think you're even stupider than me. Are you trying so hard to keep a good relationship with the chained that you're even ready to fall out with Quinn? Do you really think the Chained are worth more than Quinn?"

Andy looked a little frustrated by Peters's words.

"I know you two are strong, but you are only two people. You guys know nothing of what is currently going on. How much do you think one person can do?"

Peter stared at him for a few moments and then left the room while shaking his head.

"If you were there a thousand years ago, you would have never said those words. There's a reason why you have statues of him everywhere." Peter said as he walked off to catch up with the others.————-

Inside a small spaceship heading towards the Earth was a young blonde man and his mother. Jake Green seemed to be listening and reading through reports from different planets.

"It says the Chained were spotted on Mars," Jake commented. "It looks like those bastards are doing something again."

"That's none of our business. We agreed to stop getting involved with them because of our deal with Andy. Keep to the deal for now." Vicky replied.

"You know, the uncles will be really annoyed that we didn't do anything to them when we were just on Mars. Even if it was just a poke here and there." Jake smiled as he imagined it would be quite fun.

Thinking of fun, he started to remember the vampire he had done combat on as well. It looked like not only would his uncles be upset, but his father would be as well for not gathering enough information on the newcomers. Either way, there were more serious matters to attend to.

"Don't worry about them. They have as much reason as I for getting rid of the Chained. After all, it's our family's fault, to begin with. When we no longer need the Chained's help, I will make sure to right the wrongs of our past."

*****

# Chapter 1657: The link
It didn't take long for the ship to return to Mars and since Quinn and his group were going to continue their journey onward to Earth, they were advised to remain on the Ship for a few hours. This was because Commander Andy needed to drop off the lieutenants back to the base and decide what to do with Yaddy while also determining who would be the latter's successor.

Of course, Quinn couldn't complain. Andy was his sure way to reach Earth without the Ship being blown to bits or without facing any unnecessary attention. During that time, while on the Ship, everyone in his group and he were currently sitting in a room.

"I'm just happy that we no longer have to wear those disguises." Peter said as he continued to touch his face. It was tiring continuously using his transform skill.

"The statue is of my old appearance... in case you are wondering."

"I can see the resemblance." Mitchell said, standing up from his bed. He was formal every time he spoke to Quinn. "It is an honour and I am thankful that you allowed me to travel with you." He added as he bowed ninety degrees.

"I know... I know." Quinn said. "I already told you as well; you don't have to be so formal with me... it feels a little weird. Anyway, I wanted to ask you something..."

Quinn proceeded to ask Mitchell if the latter had completed the request he had asked for earlier and asked if he saw anyone else doing the same thing. That was when Mitchell explained to Quinn that a few other vampires who were nearby him at the time had acted in their own accord due to the respect they held in their hearts for the Hero Quinn.

"So the condition worked, and I got those extra celestial points. If Andy still decides to go through with my request and gets the whole vampire corps to do the ritual, then the number of celestial points will increase significantly, but I'm sure that's not on his priority list. He might not even do it, but at least he doesn't know that I will always be aware if he has or hasn't completed what I requested of him, so there's no way he can fool me."

Either way, Quinn knew now was the right choice to make Mitchell a dedicated follower. Of course, he would need to explain the benefits and the risks that came with it as well.

Since there were no longer any secrets, Quinn explained to the latter what being a dedicated follower would mean. A lot of it was new news to the vampire and to Lucia, who was in the room. They had never heard of a human or a vampire capable of doing such a thing.

However, this reminded them that Quinn Talen wasn't a typical vampire. He may not have been an Original, but he had the strength which other vampires couldn't even fathom, which allowed him to beat the Dalki in the first place.

Of course, even after Quinn explained the risks, Mitchell agreed and not only that, he seemed pleased that he was chosen.

[You have gained a Dedicated Follower]

[3 Celestial points have been granted]

[15/23 Celestial points are available]

Quinn still wanted to keep quite a few celestial points with him. After all, it did seem to help when he was facing celestial followers or other celestials. Also, since draining celestial energy from followers was something he could do, it was highly likely that this was something the other Celestials could do as well.

Giving his Dedicated followers more energy would make them a potential target. Quinn also found out that he couldn't get double points from a follower and dedicated follower. Since Mitchell had already completed the condition, Quinn didn't gain another celestial point for having a dedicated follower, although now it would be permanent, and Mitcehll wouldnвt have to sacrifice blood every month.

Hearing this and seeing all of this take place, Lucia, who was in the room, was a bit disappointed. It didn't seem like a thing that was limited to vampires, yet Quinn hadn't asked her to become a dedicated follower. She still didn't know whether or not she would have, accepted due to the condition of death and being linked to a particular person, but she still would have liked Quinn to ask.

"I guess... he just doesn't see us two as that close, I would say it's because we haven't known each other for long, but he hasn't known that lieutenant long either." Lucia sulked to herself.

Rather than ask this,, she had another question she wanted to ask, but just as she was about to, she saw Quinn do something quite strange. Quinn pressed his ear against the door to hear if anyone was guarding the door.

"Mitchell, how long do you think will it take before Andy returns?" Quinn asked. "He has a lot of things to address. It should take him at least a couple of hours." Mitchell replied.

"Do you know where they would keep prisoners?"

Of course, with his position, Mitchell knew that as well, and that's when Quinn decided to do something. A large shadow rose from the ground, appeared beside him, and slowly turned into his exact replica.

"If you don't mind, come with me," Quinn said to Mitchell and then, glancing at Peter, he added.

"And Peter, use a mud mask on Minny for Mitchell's replacement."

With their replacements staying on board the ship, Quinn decided there was one person he wanted to see, so he and Mitchell were travelling through the shadow space heading straight for the cells located at the vampire Corps base.

Honestly, there was nothing left for Quinn to do on Mars, no one to stay behind for and nothing to find out about. However, there was one person he still wanted to talk to, his only link to this planet and the Red Vampires.

After reaching the cells, Quinn went past many criminals, most of them were vampires, and occasionally he would pass by a human. Eventually, Quinn and Mitchell appeared in front of a cell.

Three vampires were placed together in this cell, and they could see what was happening on the other side of the cell. Regardless, as quickly as Quinn and Mitchell appeared, they disappeared in the next moment, but they took one of the vampires with them.

"Hey... who was that? Did you see their faces?" One of the remaining two vampires frowned.

"No, it's so dark here, anyway, who cares about that - hmm? Fu#k, they took Hannah!" The other vampire suddenly shouted at the end of the words upon seeing the third vampire amongst them was now missing.

At the same time, Hannah was in Quinn's shadow lock. She knew ilt was an individual place, disconnected from everything outside.

Regaining her composure, Hannah looked around, wondering where she was, she could see nothing, but there were a few noises in the distance, which concerned her for a bit until she saw the person in front of her.

"Who... who are you?" Hannah asked. It was the first time she saw Quinn's real face; thus, she didn't recognise him.

"I'm... the one who was travelling with you. This is what I really look like." Quinn replied. "But I didn't come to show you my real face. I am here because I can get you out of this place. If the vampire corps keeps you here, it will most likely be your end."

It didn't take long for Hannah to figure out who this was, especially since she had seen the shadow powers before, which she presumed was the place they were in now.

"You mean a crueller death than what you did to my fellow before?" Hannah asked. "Why would you even break me free? Are you actually a guardian for the Red Vampires, or are you trying to trick me? And why do you need me anyway if either one of my questions is true?".

"Because I'm not with the Vampire Corps, nor am I with the Red Vampires. I've just learnt that the dhampirs plan to attack one of the Red Vampire leaders because they have the latter's location. Now, if you ask me, it might mean that your position will become a little complicated."

"As for why I'm helping you, you can believe me or not, but I'm a little worried that maybe some of my friends are part of the Red Vampires, and I don't want them to get hurt." Quinn answered without hiding his true intentions since there was no need to lie anymore.

"The death you gave to Derik... it was too far. I would rather die in the Vampire Corps hands than yours." Hannah replied, but she seemed a little hesitant.

"But... I want to live; I want to believe what you're saying is true... I'm your only way to the red vampires, aren't I?"

"That means... you should keep me alive and take me out of here." Hannah requested.

"But tell me, what is the name of the Red Vampire, or that are your friends? Maybe I can confirm if they're even in the group or not."

Of course, Quinn already knew that she didn't know. Quinn had already asked the other Red Vampires about the leaders' names, but they had no clue. Then how would Hannah know their names?

"I doubt you know their name, but maybe if I tell you their name now. It might let you help me find them quicker in the future...well, her name... is Layla Munrow." Quinn answered.

*****

# Chapter 1658: To Earth!
Perhaps, saying the name out loud, Quinn was expecting somewhat of a reaction from Hannah, but there was nothing. If Tiker didn't know what the leaders names were, it was unlikely that Hannah would know either.

For a split second, Hannah saw a change in Quinn's expression. She knew he was expecting something. Seeing this made her recall the time when she first saw him. When the two first met, she wasn't afraid of him even after knowing his great strength. She just knew that she needed to be cautious and not get on his wrong side.

Honestly, even after seeing what this vampire could do, her opinion didn't really change. In Derik's incident... she had figured out what most likely happened after she had time to think about it. During the fight in the room, her reactions were irrational after seeing the Dhampir.

"I... will help." Hannah replied. "I still don't think what we Red Vampires are doing is wrong and if you have a friend or someone you know in the red vampires, then it means they believe the same."

"I... I haven't made a report back to the Red Vampire base and the other guys weren't able to as well."

"I will be your link and even help you if you let me go back to the Red vampires. I know I'm not in a position to ask this, but I don't think the two of us are enemies here."

Quinn thought about it for a while. Hannah had helped him, and it was true that he shouldn't put of the red vampires in the same category just all because of one bad incident. At the same time, he was sure after having witnessed his strength, she wouldn't try anything funny, and even if she did, such as alerting more members of the red vampires to their position, Quinn wouldn't be bothered because he was confident in his own strength.

Unlike in the past, Quinn wasn't afraid of whatever came to face him. If they were to go to him instead of him visiting them, he was okay with that since that would save his time.

"In return for your help, I'm happy to bring you back to the Red Vampires, but I need to do many things before that." Quinn stated. "Feel free to stay in this place. There are a couple of guests in here to keep you entertained and I will warn you again from trying to do anything stupid... it would be wise if you were to listen to him."

Of course, Hannah was greatly confused by this because she only saw endless darkness and didn't find anyone else around them. However, there was the sound of whistling wind even though she couldn't feel anything.

"Wait!" Hannah called out. "What are you doing... maybe I can help in some way? That way, you can trust me more, and if you don't, you can put me back in this shadow jail thing."

"I have a meeting with the Chained," Quinn answered, and to his surprise, Hannah took a bit of a step back.

"Oh, you know about them?"

"Right, yes... the Chained are one of the strongest groups on Earth. So much so that even the Red Vampires have tried to avoid them as much as possible."

"They not only have strong abilities but are a little bit on the crazy side."

"Still, even though they are undisciplined, every group, in a way, has tried its best to ignore them, and we can say that the Chained have done the same. Why would you be meeting them... don't tell me you are planning to attack them?... That would be a death wish."

For the Red Vampires to be so afraid that they even avoided this group, Quinn thought the Chained had to be somewhat strong. Still, he doubted if they were as frightening as One Horn, Graham, and others. In his mind, the current most prominent problem for him was either Laxmus or Erin.

"If I can talk things over with the Chained, I'm hoping there won't be a need for that. Anyway, since you're willing to help me, I will consider it and might bring you out later." Quinn said and left the shadow space before Hannah could respond.

"This vampire... he's really going against the Chained... but with who? Which group? or is he planning to go on his own? Damn it! I have to think of a way to save myself if he decides to do something like that."

With nothing to do, Hannah decided to walk through the space. She was wondering if there was anyone else in here. Either way, it didn't take long for the windy sound, which she had heard all along, to intensify.

The hairs on her body stood up as she felt the goosebumps. She knew something was coming toward her. She prepared her red vampire aura in her hands, ready for an attack. However, when she saw what was coming toward her, her hands and shoulders dropped, and a helpless expression appeared on her face.

"What... is that... is that a... dragon?!"

Before she even had the time to think about anything else, the huge dragon landed only a few feet away from her. She expected that with the latter's weight, there would be an earthquake upon its landing on the shadowed ground, but no such thing happened in the shadow space. What she did aura though, was that she increased her red aura output and made sure to cover herself.

"Welcome! It looks like he has given me another one to look after." Ray stated, speaking directly to her head as he would do to Quinn.

"I can hear and understand the beast!"

'Yes... I can hear you and I can speak to you! Ray replied. "Either way, now that you are in this shadow space, I must welcome you. The thing is, I get a little bored here, and the other two have begun to bore me a little, so you have come at the perfect time."

Hannah was wondering if she was dreaming of everything. The whole thing seemed crazy, and she wondered what a giant Dragon beast was even doing in this space in the first place. Was it a pet of some sort?

"Me? A pet? How dare you?!" Ray was instantly irked.

At that moment, Hannah saw two lines of yellow aura coming right for her. She quickly rolled and skidded across the ground, narrowly avoiding both of them.

When she looked up, she saw two Dhampirs with the dragon. They jumped off, and it looked like they were ready to charge in, but the dragon soon put its feet in front of them, stopping their path.

The two dhampirs immediately stopped moving and obeyed the dragon.

"Don't worry, if Quinn wants you alive, I will keep you alive, but I will make you three fight each other in the meantime. Grow stronger and maybe one day you will be able to entertain me a little bit." Ray smiled, revealing his enormous sharp teeth.

"Wait...Quinn.. are you talking about the Hero Quinn?" Hannah asked.

Once again, Ray just smiled, revealing that there was a lot for her to learn.-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-

Meanwhile, Quinn returned to the ship with Mitchell, and it looked like everything was alright. The others were all still patiently waiting, and Minny had a big smile on her face. It didn't take long after that, that the group was ready to head to Earth.

It looked like whatever Andy needed to do was done, and now they were heading to Earth. The rest of the journey between the group was primarily silent. Lucia was trying to find the right time to approach Quinn. However, she found him playing with Minny.

Earlier she had suggested they play tag, and since Quinn was faster than Minny, it proved to be quite the challenge and training experience for Minny. Of course, Quinn was holding back and would let her win. Until Minny started to brag, of course, and then Quinn would catch her once in a while.

It was a nice sight to see, which was why Lucia decided she should wait for now and ask her questions later.

Just then, an announcement resounded throughout the ship.

"We are now approaching Planet Earth."

# Chapter 1659: Is it a good day?
After the first Dalki war, Earth didn't have as much land mass as it did in the past. This led to gigantic highrise buildings surrounded by walls. Since the war was going on at the time, it also allowed protection in case of an attack.

Due to the low population of the human race, the little landmass worked out better for them. However, the current time was not like that of the past. In the past, only the wealthiest people could live on earth, while others would have no choice but to live on the beast planet's solar system.

Now though, Earth had once again become a type of battleground. More so in a political sense, but extremists in each group would constantly fight against each other, leaving those on earth as some of the strongest in the solar system.

The top members of all groups lived there; one had to be strong and brave enough to, so they respected those who did. Logan Green, Andy and even the group Pure, who mostly were on Earth, whose support was growing by the day, not just within the current solar system but outside it as well.

On earth, there was one piece of vast land that had been transformed. This piece of land had a single building built on it, or more correctly, a luxury resort in a sense that had everything-an entertainment area for games, several swimming pools, workout areas, large gyms and more.

It was similar to a giant luxury shopping mall or a state of the art airport. However, it wasn't either of those things. This was a home, a building that was owned by the Chained.

All members of the Chained lived there, and there were a hundred rooms. There weren't many members of the Chained. They numbered fifty in total, and the others that lived in the building were servants, workers or guests.

When an official member would perish, they would replace that member.

As for families, the members of the Chained didn't really have a family. It was a weakness to them, and they weren't the type to settle down. Once in a while, perhaps a member would pass on their knowledge of their ability to a person, then when they perished. That student could attempt to join the chain, but there was no guarantee.

If they chose not to do this, each Chained member was to write details of how their ability worked and put it into an Ability book that would be stored in a particular place.

However, they didn't operate like Pure despite having some similarities in their system. There was no internal ranking of who was strongest. Everyone knew they were strong ability users and a lot of them had the same history and past. The Chained, the original and core members all had the same goal they were working towards.

The leader made sure of that because it was a prerequisite to joining the Chained in the first place. He made sure that all members followed this rule, or there would be an unavoidable punishment.-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-

Inside the large establishment, looking at herself in the mirror, sitting up straight, Jessica couldn't help but let out a big puff of air.

"Dear, please, could you not move so much while doing this? We promise it won't take so long." A woman said, who was busy applying makeup onto Jessica's cheeks.

Jessica was in a room that would be fit for a princess. It was large, glamorous and had all the luxuries one could want. Even staring out the balcony overlooking the swimming pools, where she could see some of the other members having fun and a laugh.

She was in a tight-fitting white dress, a wedding dress. At the moment they were going through a trial run of the wedding. It wasn't the actual day, but they were picking the hairstyle and the dress and other things.

"Hey, if I tried to escape, would you try and stop me?" Jessica asked.

Other than the four maids attending her, there didn't seem to be anyone else in the room. No members of the Chained anyway. There were worried looks on the maids faces when asked this question.

"Please don't try that, miss Jessica. Otherwise, we all would be in great trouble." The maid said.

"I know... I know." Jessica sighed again. "It would be selfish of me and besides, now that I'm in this place. I could never escape it. Maybe when there were only a few Chained here and there, but all fifty of them."

"This has to be one of the most secure prisons in the world."-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-

In another part of the connected building, there were quite a few members in a dark bar. It was lit up with different Neon lights, music blaring out loudly. Some female dancers were wearing skimpy clothing that were from the outside, not part of the Chained group.

They had been brought in for a particularly high paying job and would be sent home when told to. Sitting in the most oversized chair, there was a medium-framed man in the room. His hair was long, blonde, curly and the strangest thing was that he was the only one wearing his beast gear, unlike all the others in the bar.

On both of the man's hands, two blades were tattooed onto them. He was the only Chained with two Blade tattoos on him, which signified that he was the leader who had built up this place and had gathered the Chained in the first place.

Sitting in his chair, he continued to watch the girls dance. Suddenly out from his side, a man looked to have appeared out of nowhere, as if he was teleported into the place.

"A report." The man said. "We have asked all the news channels to be ready for your big day, sir. At the same time, invitations are ready to be handed out to all of the groups. The Vampire corps, the Green family, the 'Graylash' group, The Bree family and more."

"We have made sure that each group sends an important figure to this wedding. After all, it is your big day. There is only one thing we need, sir, and that is the day of the wedding itself." The leader continued to stare ahead at the girls, not breaking eye contact.

"Send an Invite to Pure and ask them if they wish to bring someone from the Dhampirs. The Red Vampires probably already have someone on the inside coming to this event. Still, there is one thing that needs to be done."

"Tell the Green's that they can't just send the Green family; they need to send a Blade as well."

Hearing this, the man looked a little nervous; he knew about the deep hatred the Chained and the Blade family had for each other.

"Don't worry; the whole world will be watching this. They won't act. It will just annoy them even more that they can't act, and if they do. Well, that gives us a chance to get rid of them without starting anything."

"We have been enjoying benefits from the Green family for quite a while now... but after this marriage. Everything will soon change, as for what day."

The man by the leader's side knew what to do. He clicked his fingers and once again, as if being teleported in, a hooded figure appeared by his side.

"Shall I have my wedding one day from now?" The leader asked.

Hearing this, the hooded figure threw out a coin onto the floor. It spun and eventually landed on the tail side.

"Two days from now." He asked again.

Pulling out another coin, the figure tossed it again, but it was the same result, landing on tails.

"Three days from now."

Throwing out the coin, this one seemed to spin for longer than any of the others. As it was slowing down, it looked like a result would appear. However, one of the girl dancers stepped on the coin.

Immediately, before she even realised it, she could no longer see as her body fell to the ground, limp and dead. The other girls were getting ready to scream, but each of them fell and died in seconds.

Then, the leader stood up and walked over to where the coin was, seeing that it landed on heads.

"What does this mean? Is the third day a good day?" the leader asked.

The hooded figure lifted its head, revealing glowing red eyes underneath.

"Yes."
