# Chapter 1830: Sea beasts. (Part 2)

It was obvious that what Sil first thought was just a dark patch in the sea, or a large underground mountain was nothing of the sort. Instead, it was a giant beast, what level or what tier, he had no idea but judging by its size, Sil thought it would at least be at the Demon-tier level.

Judging by how far they were, it seemed like the tentacles could stretch miles. In the next second, all of the large tentacles headed straight into the ground. Piles of rocks and rubble from the destroyed ruins were being chucked up all over the place, and immediately the two of them were surrounded by several tentacles.

They started swinging down towards the two of them and using the water jets on his hands, He started to swim out of the way, allowing for the tentacles to miss him.

"To truly test the Dalki, it's best if the two of us split up." Sil thought.

Eventually, when they were far enough, Sil had come across what used to look like a house, It was one of the most non destroyed structures in the area. Landing on top of it, several of the tentacles that were chasing after him rose from the ground.

Suddenly, Sil's fighting face expression changed and immediately all of the water around Sil started to move and bubble. The tentacles moved at the same time to slam down on Sil, but immediately the water moved in slashes outward in all directions from Sil.

The next second several of the tentacles fell onto the ground, and blood was seen floating in the water all over the place.

"That was a warning for you," Sil said out loud. "Don't try to attack me unless you want a short life. Just stay back."

When saying these words, Sil looked towards the large dark figure and the red eyes in the distance. For some reason, from that one attack, it looked like all the tentacles were being pulled away.

Now all that was left was for Sil to see just how Doguth would deal with all of this.

"A five spike Dalki against a demon tier. Quinn told me to keep an eye on him, but if he can't handle it, am I meant to help him?" Sil wondered.

Doguth was unable to pay attention to what was happening to him, and he wasn't even aware that Sil had gone off because he was focusing too much on his own battle.

The tentacles were strong and rampant. One had come towards him, but it was stopped with one hand from the Dalki, but his side was soon hit by another and had sent him flying in the air. The Dalki felt some of his ribs break and a little bit of green blood was coming out of his mouth.

While in pain, the Dalki didn't stop his attack, since he continued to use the red lazer energy from his eyes. It seems to be the most effective as whatever it hit would either burn the end of the tentacle or cut through it.

However, it looked like Doguth could only use it in short bursts, as he would stop once in a while and resort to using his hands.

"Stop annoying me!" Doguth shouted as he threw a punch down right on the head of a large tentacle. It slammed into the ground creating cracks on the sea floor.

"Ah yes, the reason why these Dalki are so difficult to deal with in the first place. Because the more hurt they are, the stronger they get." Sil thought.

Although the Dalki was doing well and able to deal with a lot of the tentacles by ripping them off with his hands, stomping on their heads with his foot, and burning them with his lazers. It still wasn't enough.

There were far too many and each time he would get hit, the muscles on the Dalki body would be hurt and restricted.

"Is he not as strong because of us being in the water? It doesn't seem to be affecting the beast at all." Sil thought.

Just then one of the tentacles for the first time in the fight had grabbed onto Doguth. It wrapped around him and was squeezing harder and harder to the point where blood was coming out from his mouth.

Seeing this, Sil let out a sigh.

"I've seen a lot of people, creatures, and beings die in front of my eyes... but I guess we need this one to live so we can find a way home." Sil opened his hand and a ball of water started to gather. Instead of pointing it towards the Dalki, he had pointed it towards the cause of the problem, the large creature in the distance.

Getting ready to deal with the creature, Sil heard a loud noise coming from his right. He could see that Doguth had broken free and not just that, he had destroyed all of the tentacles around him.

Immediately after, Doguth started to run towards the large creature off in the distance. As he continued to run, more of the tentacles would appear in an attempt to strike him down.

The Dalki, even without having to swim, had been hurt beyond belief was stronger than before and was now faster. When Doguth got close, suddenly out from the ground around him, tentacles appeared creating a wall in front of him.

Opening his eyes, the red lazer came out wider than Sil had ever seen it before and it had completely evaporated the large tentacles off.

"What is going on here... wait don't tell me." Sil started to think back to the fight he had seen so far, he didn't notice it before because it was subtle but he was sure of it.

"The Dalki, as they get hurt more not only is he getting stronger, but his ability is as well. This... is messed up." Sil thought.

As soon as Sil had finished his thought, Doguth, had already reached the large creature and now there was a giant hole through its head. It had without a doubt died, and on top of that, Doguth looked to have taken the Demon tier crystal as well.

"This is not what I expected." Sil thought.

Swimming towards Doguth, Sil landed by his side and checked to see if he was okay. He was bleeding quite a bit, but as always with a Dalki it was hard to tell if they were on thier last legs or not.

"I see you were alive, but you are too late I have killed the beast, so the crystal is rightfully mine, correct?" The Dalki said.

For some reason, the Dalki, itself seemed to be obsessed with crystals, Sil already had plenty before and letting go of one crystal at least for now, he didn't mind.

The two of them started to feel the water inosing all around them. It was as if there were waves underneath the sea. It was a strange feeling and stranger when they couldn't see anything.

Because of this, Sil started to use his ability again and he soon regretted it.

"This might be a bit troublesome," Sil said.

It didn't take long for the Dalki to figure out what was happening because soon large dark figures could be seen in the distance and they were getting bigger by the second. The single large beast wasn't the end of their troubles.

"It looks like the two of us will really be dying here. It's such a shame." Doguth said.

"Hey, I thought Dalki weren't like that. I thought they were warriors that fought to the death. You are a strange one." Sil stated walking forward and in front of Doguth.

"It's okay, you can rest. I have something that can deal with all of these, I wasn't going to use it, bur I guess since there is no one around, it will be alright."

Opening up the portal, Sil reached in and pulling out of it, was one of his favourite weapons that had originally come from this planet, the great trident.

"Let's get rid of all of these and get out of here."

# Chapter 1831: The crowning. (Part 1)

Both women had no problem entering the capital city of the Memorial race.

Usually, they would have had trouble entering the Hydro station and the city, trying to avoid the gaze of the guards and more, but thankfully it seemed at least luck was on their side for now.

Thousands of people had come to the city today to celebrate the crowning of the New King, Yanny. They were unaware of this when they first arrived at the scene, but while using the large crowd to their advantage to get out of the lax security in the Hydro station, they overheard people excitedly talk about the event.

Once in the city, both girls decided to take a break as they swam between two buildings and looked at everyone swimming past.

"What's wrong?" Ceril asked as she slowly floated to her sister. Tears were running down her face. Lately, she had seen her sister cry more often, but at least she knew what the trigger was before. At the moment, she didn't know what had brought this on.

"These people, don't they care what is happening to our family?" Wince replied.

"We served them for years, trying our best to make them have a better life, protecting them and sacrificing our lives for them."

"The Royal army has been captured, including the families, yet these people are doing nothing. Instead, they're just heading to the city square to celebrate the person responsible for this. Don't they care about our lives, how long we were on the run for!"

Since they were underwater, her tears were hard to notice, but Wince's eyes had turned bloodshot, and her tears were large and light, causing them to flow up like air bubbles.

"You followed in your father's footsteps for a long time. You should know that people are selfish. They won't revolt because it will affect their lives, and what happens between the two groups is not their business."

"You shouldn't take this to heart. This is just how the nature of people is. People are selfish" Ceril tried to calm her down.

Although they were sisters, Ceril was never a contender for the throne. So she never felt any tremendous pressure, nor did she really feel like she had lost anything when the Predators took over, which was why she could relate to the people a bit more than Wince could.

Wiping away her tears and rubbing her sore eyes, Wince regained her composure and firmed her will because she knew she couldn't afford to give up. She had to be strong for the people who relied on her, those who had worked in the palace and looked after her, and those who were captured for sticking up with her family.

Wince took a deep breath and quickly swam into the crowd of people, with Ceril following right behind, and now, the two were back on the street. It was obvious where they were going: to the main square. It was the city centre that would surely be filled with busy shops, restaurants, and stages throughout the whole area.

There was a large fountain in the middle that spouted out a mystic pink light, and in front of it was a statue of her father made out of pure pearl.

Today though, the place didn't look like how it used to be. It was much different. There was a giant stage that had been made. It looked like a fairly large pirate ship. With another ship on top of that and another one on top. It was tiered and used to be the Predator's base.

In the past, they weren't welcome to step foot in such a place, so they would sail on the surface of the open sea. It was a strange and hard sight for Mercil to see.

"What's the plan?" Ceril whispered.

Both were towards the back of the crowd, letting others go in front.

"We wait for the crowning ceremony to begin. I imagine all the Generals will be here to witness it, including Yanny. That will be the perfect time to head to the Vault and open it up."

"Then we just need to hurry and get out of here as fast as we can."

They waited a good twenty minutes, and now the entire place was completely packed, shoulder to shoulder, and finally, a horn was played, resounding throughout the whole city.

"Everyone, please cheer for the one and only Yanny Bling!" A huge whale-like creature announced.

The crowd did as he said and cheered and waved their arms, and of course, Wince didn't, in protest to the whole thing. She had to remind herself of Ceril's words from before because right now, she felt like she was standing with a bunch of hypocrites.

As the crowd calmed down, a fairly large figure stepped out from a door and walked onto the ship's deck. He was muscular and had a yellowish skin colour. He had three arms on each side and two legs, all containing several round suckers on them. Then finally, there was a strange pattern all over Yanny's body which looked like blue rings.

Several blue rings could be seen on his skin, which made him stand out compared to the others by his side who soon joined him. There were those that looked similar to sharks, crocodiles, killer whales, swordfish, and more, but as for the most frightening one of them all, Yanny, he resembled that of an octopus on earth.

"I knew this day would come." Were Yanny's first words as he raised two of his arms.

"The day when the people would accept the Predators. Under the old rule, it was only a matter of time before our own politics would have crushed us."

"Making sure to accommodate every single person, making up for others weakness, trying to make them equal, and punishing those that are great and do the most for our race."

"The Supreme Being told me that there are threats that we need to worry about, so in order to protect everyone."

"I decided to act and replace the regime that behaved ignorantly and sowed a false sense... a world that hid the real truth."

"But now, the times have changed, and this day marks a new beginning!"

"Together, we will only focus on improving and making ourselves the best of the best, to make our lives and our race the best there is, not just in the galaxy but the whole universe!"

There were some loud cheers from the crowd from those that truly believed in what Yanny was saying. While others were being swept up in the moment by this charisma, but then, there were also a few who saw through this and were a bit more cautious.

"Does this mean we will be going to war?"

"There hasn't been a war in hundreds of years. So what threat is he talking about? Why do we have to act now."

"Weren't things okay before?"

Her eyes lit up hearing these words for the first time.

"There are those... that appreciate what we did. They might not openly say it, but their actions just now prove it. Father... you didn't waste your time."

While thinking of this, Wince looked at the statue of her great and old father with the trident in his hands. It gave her strength until she heard a slashing sound, and the next second, her father's head fell from the statue and rolled to the floor.

"The old rule is no more!" Yanny shouted. "The Crowning Ceremony shall now commence."

Several explosions from the building were heard nearby, shooting sparkles into the centre. It looked like a lot of preparation had been done for the whole event, and today would be quite the party for them all.

Wince felt someone was looking over them because of all the days they could have come back, today was the perfect day for them to act.

"Alright, let's get going." Wince said as she turned around, ready to swim off and head around the centre's route to enter the palace. She had only swam a few metres before she heard a loud shout.

"PRINCESS WINCE IS HERE! I REPEAT, PRINCESS WINCE IS HERE!" Someone shouted these words at the top of their lungs. Immediately, the people cleared the area around Wince, and everyone could see them.

"Oh, what's this?" Yanny said with a smile on his face. "The princess has returned home and has come right back to me. What a surprise, what a surprise indeed."

Now that she had been spotted, Wince couldn't escape. She knew this, but even more so, she was heartbroken looking at the person who had shouted and alerted everyone.

"Ceril... why?" Wince could barely say anything as the rest of the words got stuck in her throat.

Thinking about it, she recalled when the tubes sent the other two to a different place, and now, it didn't seem like an accident anymore.

***

# Chapter 1832: The Crowning. (Part 2)

The crowd around Wince began to back off, and within a few moments, there was no one within the ten-metre radius of the Princess. The look on the people's faces had also undergone one eighty degree change, and many of them seemed displeased.

"Why did she come back?"

"This silly girl, she should have just used the chance to run away. We all know what will happen to her now."

There was no slander against the Princess's name, just concern, and pity from the general public. For them, either way, both groups wished to improve their race. They just had their own ideals and way of working.

However, the general populace held no negative stigma for either faction, and they knew that in all of this, the Princess was innocent. She got involved in this simply because she had blood ties to the previous leader.

Meanwhile, Wince had ignored the looks of pity and stood on her spot in shock. She wanted to understand why her own sister, who had been through the same things as her, betrayed her all of a sudden.

"Ceril! I know we don't come from the same mother, but they will kill both of us. Why have you done this?!" Wince shouted, not caring if the others heard.

Ceril took a step back and began to move away slightly. Heading to where the crowd was.

"You remember what I said before... everyone is selfish. Everyone does things for themselves. Giving you up means that I can live." Ceril replied. Her voice carried no emotions, and her face looked as if she was talking to a corpse.

Now, Wince understood, at some point during their trip, or maybe even when they had travelled, Ceril must have made a deal with the Predators to spare her in exchange for her sister's life.

"It means I can live a happy life with my family," Ceril added at last, and a smile appeared on her face.

Just then, coming out of the crowd behind her was someone who one of the crowd knew well. He was one of the top members of the Predator gang and was always by Yanny's side. The name of this Predator was Mokoon. His stature was tall, and now he stood with strange curled-up arms resembling a worm's body.

He placed his hand on Ceril's shoulder and, leaning over her, gave her a huge kiss, sticking his tongue down her throat in front of everyone. When he pulled his mouth back, saliva could be seen sticking to the two tongues.

"You... you did this to her! You damn parasite!" Wince shouted. "I know how your powers work. Get that bug out of her head now!"

Mokoon was a special fish and part of the Meremerial race. He was incredibly dangerous as he could place parasites inside others' heads. And whoever had a parasite inside them would naturally be charmed towards the host-doing his bidding for them.

Hearing Wince's cry, Mokoon's shoulders trembled up and down as he started to laugh out loud.

"You seem to know my power well, but you should also know how I would need to transfer said parasite into another. I assure you the feelings were mutual at the time. I just needed to have reassurance."

Judging from what the parasite was saying, the two were in a relationship before everything transpired.

Wince didn't know whether to believe it or if it was just to throw her off. Either way, it had worked, and now Wince didn't know who she had on her side anymore.

"Capture her, but don't use the guns. We need her alive." Mokoon ordered the guards.

Immediately, out from the crowd, eight guards in the same get-up as the attackers on the Marpo-Cruise came out. They had their energy swords in their hands, producing steam since they were using them underwater.

One of the guards ran forward and swung down quickly as if they weren't even in water in the first place. Still, the Princess wasn't powerless, and she promptly avoided the sword and grabbed the man by the wrist.

She then spun him towards the others and sent him crashing into the other guards. At the same time, she now had one of the energy blades in her hand. Swinging it faster than the others, she deflected the attacks coming her way and slashed across the chest of one of them.

Next, she swam forward fast with her tail and threw her hand out, making a whirlpool of water. It smashed against one of the guard's chest and sent him throwing the water.

The guards were not faring well against the Princess.

"It won't be easy to take me. I trained with my father every day. The Strongest Meremerial to ever live!"

The guards slowly got up from the ground, and more started to enter the open area. It was then though, landing on his large two feet, that someone jumped into the centre-one with a large fin on his back and a sharp pointy nose.

Seeing this, Wince wasn't as confident anymore. It was another one of the Predators. When he swung his hands, Wince went to counter it with the blade, but the shark man just opened his palm and quickly grabbed it.

In the next second, the whole energy of the blade had extinguished right there, and now Wince suddenly had no weapon.

"It would be best if you gave up." A familiar voice spoke, walking through the crowd, it was now Yanny's turn to enter the stage.

"We will not kill you. After all, we need you, but I promise that if you put up without a fight, we will allow you... no, let's say allow you to live a life." Yanny smiled.

"All of my trusted Predators are by my side, and although you are strong, not a single one of them can be bested by you."

Princess tried to look at the situation around her, the people, her sister on the other side, but there was no one on her side, no one to help, and even her father's head, although it was just a statue.

"Please, Princess, just give up. We don't want to see your blood." She heard a voice from the crowd.

"Life is the most important thing, don't give it up for us.

For some reason, hearing these words had drained the energy out of her, and she no longer had the will to fight back. She knew it was hopeless if she did.

"You made the right choice." Yanny clicked his fingers, and immediately, he placed a pair of energy cuffs on her from behind and a large shackle around her tail as well. Then, two guards walked up and held her by her hands.

After dealing with her, Yanny walked over to Ceril.

"You have done well, but we only need one bloodline to continue." Yanny placed one of his hands on Ceril's head, and the blue rings all over his body started to glow.

"NOOO!" Wince shouted. "What are you doing? I gave up, and you made a deal with her! She did everything you said!"

Suddenly, Ceril's eyes stopped moving. Her whole body froze like a statue as she fell over onto her side, hitting the surface. A few seconds later, her body started to float higher and higher, heading to the surface of the deep ocean.

"You murderer! You scum! Liar! You deserve a thousand deaths!" Wince continued to shout until she started feeling pain in her throat.

"Perhaps you are right," Yanny replied. "But with your father gone, who can stop me?"

Yanny then started to walk away, planning to continue his celebration. After all, everything was dealt with, and he now had what he wanted until he suddenly heard laughter from behind.

"Ha, ha, ha!" Wince laughed with her head tilted back. Her hair had become dishevelled and was in front of her face. Her eyes were bulging as if she had turned into a mad woman.

"Yanny, you are wrong... I have seen people stronger than my father, stronger than you... and I have brought them here! So let me ask you, do you think you are stronger than a god?"

"A god?" Yanny replied, raising his eyebrow.

"Did you forget whose support we have? You have gone mad. If you really have a god, then why isn't he here? Where is he?"

Just as he finished his words, everyone in the city square felt the ocean's currents moving.

***

# Chapter 1833: Six hours.

The currents moving this deep in the ocean and in the city no less was a strange phenomenon to them all. It was something none of them had experienced before. It caused everyone to go silent as a tingling sensation was felt all over their bodies.

"This feeling, it's a bad omen for us all." An old frail fish woman stated. Although many thought the old woman was one of those that constantly spouted tales of doom or gloom, many felt like she was right this time.

"What is that?" Wince said as she leaned back and looked at the large dark figure that was moving through the ocean, coming closer and closer to their position. Eventually, it was close enough for the people to figure out what it was.

"SEA MONSTER!" A member of the crowd shouted.

The light reflected off the sea monster's body and now it could be seen in full view. It had a hard red outer shell with a large orange underbelly that was showing to the rest. On the belly itself, there were several large legs like a centipede.

What made the beast look disgusting most of all though was the several large floating balls it had sticking out. There were around ten of them dangling on long thin parts, but they weren't just balls, but the eyeballs of the beast.

Opening up, each one of them was around the size of a car, and they soon turned to look at all of the people below. Spreading out wide, the Mermieral race gulped. Although they were strong, most of them weren't fighters.

That part belonged to the royal family and those that had been recruited into the predators as guards. A sea beast of this size and power was simply too much for them. Which was why panic had started.

The Fish people had started to swim away from the large beast. They scurried through the water as fast as they could, but rather than leave the square completely, many decided to take cover in the shops, or behind large scale buildings, while looking at what was to occur.

After all, leaving the city was not an option, as entering the sea to get out would mean running into even more of the sea beasts, but there was one option for them all, and that's when many began to run for the Hydro stations.

"I'm sorry for involving you all, but these have to go, so no one can escape." A voice said.

Wince taking a closer look at the beast, noticed that on top of one of the eyes, there was a human figure.

"That's... that's the one that was with Quinn all the time. The one named Sil! So they made it!" A slight smile appeared on her face, but it also went away quite quickly as it is unlikely Quinn was here.

She was sure his companions were strong but strong enough to get them out of this situation, she was unsure.

"Wait a second, how is he even riding on top of a sea beast like that?"

This was why the guards, the predators and Yanny himself were cautious about attacking the Sea beast having noticed the one on top of it.

Just as Yanny was about to open his mouth to ask who this was, a large explosion was heard. Turning their heads they could see that the Hydro station had been completely destroyed.

When the dust started to settle they could see that there was a large Lizard man now floating where the Hydro station once was.

"I saw what he did, he punched the Hydro station and destroyed it in a single hit. What is that!" One of the people yelled and panicked.

"Don't worry, there's another Hydro station on the other side." Another replied and turned around, only to see a red beam go straight over her head. The next second and the other Hydro station was destroyed and had crumbled, burnt to bits.

The mechanism that was used for the tubes were ruined and the people could no longer escape. Because of this, the only thing they could do was hide in their homes and behind structures as they watched what was going on.

"I'm guessing, you are the help that Wince talked about?" Yanny stated.

"Let me ask you if there is anything I can suggest to you so that you don't interfere?"

Sil was quite surprised by this, and had ordered the sea beast to drop him down slightly moving one of the large Eyeballs closer to the others, so they were at the same level yet still far away.

All the guards had their pistols ready and they quickly got ready and aimed at Sil.

"Ah, so you were the guys that tried to attack us last time I see." Sil replied. "Unfortunately, there is nothing that you can give me because you see, I have a debt that I need to pay back."

Putting both hands to his side, Sil had created two balls of water that were constantly hitting against each other, and before the others could react he threw them out towards Yanny.

Both of them had expanded in size, creating two large balls of water, but around them, there were several slashes going through it. The water was pressurised and controlled in such a way that it would slice through anything it would touch. If a person was to touch the large ball a constant strike would hit their body.

When the ball got close to Yanny, he simply touched the balls and the slashes had stopped, the balls got smaller, and crushing them in his hand they had turned to nothing.

"You have a lot of power over the sea I see. No wonder you are confident. It's a shame for you, that it's the same for me." Yanny stated, clicking one of his fingers.

In that moment, all of the guards fired their guns and began to hit the large beast. At the same time, controlling the water, Sil was able to block the lasers from hitting him, and leapt up off the beast so he was now on the floor.

The beast was enraged and began to run through the guards swinging its large eyeballs towards them knocking them out, and soon swimming and landing right next to Sil, there was the Dalki.

"Predators!" Yanny shouted, and out of the lot of them 10 fierce looking fish men had come out on display. They looked like they were fighting humanoid demon tier beasts in front of them, and Sil felt the same way if they were all as strong as Yanny.

"Take them out!," Yanny order.

The predators immediately started to swim toward the two, adn Sil knew this was going to be trouble.

"With my abilities, I have to switch every once in a while so I can breathe, and If I don't use the water ability my movements are slow."

"This really is a pain in the arse fighting underwater, I need to figure out some way we can get to the surface." Sil thought.

It was annoying him that all of these would be easy to deal with if they were just outside, Although he had a large amount of MC cells to use his water ability on, it didn't mean he was the best at using it.

Throwing out his hands, two large slashes of water came out of them. This attack was faster than the Clash balls as Sil had called them. Still, in the water, they were able to easily avoid them, and the next second he could see a type of shark man come towards him with his mouth wide open.

"Switch to strength."

Sil thought in that second and grabbed the mouth of the Shark. Its jaws were incredibly powerful, so Sil was glad he had decided to use his strength ability at the same time.

The next second, he slammed the shark man onto the floor, but another crocodile man had bitten the back of his leg, his teeth sinking through his skin and armour. Switching back to his water ability, Sil shot out a vortex of water, hitting the crocodile man right on the head, and spinning him, sending him away.

"Alright, you damn lizard!" Sil said.

"I'm going to need you to at least take on five of these guys, so I can deal with the rest."

"I have bad news." The Dalki said, shooting out his Lazer at the others trying to keep them at a distance. "I can only fight for around thirty more minutes before I need to breathe."

***

# Chapter 1834: Belongs to you.

A distinctive memory had appeared in Sil's head when he heard the Dogthus speak, about claiming he could breathe underwater for at least six hours. The reason why he remembered, was because it sounded as if the Dalki was bragging to everyone about how much better he was compared to the others.

At least, that was how it sounded in Sil's head. Regardless, even though they had been in the water for a long time, they hadn't been in for six hours.

"Is it because of all the fighting he did before, or was he just trying to sound impressive? Either way, fighting ten of these guys on my own is going to be troublesome." Sil thought.

As he made what looked like a blade out of the water. It was condensed and constantly moving like waves. Swinging it, Sil had managed to deflect a few stingers that had been shot out with the sword and used his other hand to send out three Hydro cannon shots at the others. It had missed two of them but hit the third one in the chest, sending him back and blood to spill in the water.

"This one is powerful, we have to be careful!" A member of the predators shouted.

Sil then raised his new water sword he had created above his head, and it began to grow larger by the second. When swinging it down, it looked to be still growing larger but was able to rip apart, part of the sea moving it away and creating pockets of air.

At that moment, Sil's blade had gone right through one of the predators, one that looked like a sting ray that was constantly sending attacks from the back. Its body split apart, and its blood had entered the sea.

The others didn't need to turn around to know he was dead, they could smell their fellow teammate's blood in the water.

"It's okay." Sil stated. "It just means we're on a bit of a time scale right now."

Unlike Sil, who was faring quite well despite the fact he could only mostly use the water ability.

Dogthus was struggling. His movements were slow and in order to avoid his red eye Lazers that seemed to be the only thing that was fast when attacking, the five predators that had gone towards him were constantly swimming around him.

He fired Lazers from his eyes, but they would hit nothing but the water, or some part of the city buildings off in the distance.

Eventually breaking out of the formation, one of the predators swam towards him at a great speed and when getting close, it lifted its head forward and slammed it down right on top of the Dalki.

Dogthus was able to react in time lifting both his hands but the blow was incredibly strong, as he saw that this type of fish man looked to have a head of a hammer.

The thing was, its hammer-like head wasn't the only weapon it had, as it swung both of its arms right towards the side of its body. The second it hit the Dalki it had heard parts of its rib's breaking.

Out of anger, more of the Dalki's Lazer powered eves were shot towards the Hammer head, but he had already escaped and the five of them had begun their formation once again, swirling around the Dalki.

"I can't breathe well, and that guy just whacked a load of oxygen out of my body. Even if I get stronger the more blood is split, I might not survive if this fight goes on."

"We need to find a way to the surface. Doesn't that humans have any good ideas." Dogthus thought, and also looked towards their sea creature friend.

Somehow, Sil was able to control the giant Sea creature, after defeating its allies it looked like one of the sea creatures was quite compliant in listening to the human. Using the Sea beast was how they were able to swim to hear the capital city. While going through the vast ocean without getting attacked.

So the Dalki thought that they could use it again to head to the surface, otherwise, there would be too many beasts for them to face on their way up. However, it didn't look like a viable option right now, and possibly never.

An endless amount of lazers were being shot from the army and guards towards the sea beast. It was in pain with some of its eyes already destroyed and pierced. There were several wounds on its body and blood was pouring out of them

Still, out of anger, the sea beast seemed to be continuing to put up a good fight, already defeating a quarter of the guards that were at the scene, How long it would last though, it was hard to say.

Meanwhile, the princess was watching everything play out, and although the two were struggling she was surprised with how the two of them were faring. Especially since the one that looked like Quinn, another human had killed one of the predators.

"What's wrong?" Wince asked seeing the look on Yanny's face. She could tell this wasn't how he expected the fight to go on.

"Is this not what you expected? Your powerful Predator race being killed just like you did to my sister!?"

Yanny turned his head to Wince and walked over to her, with his hands he brushed the guards away, and grabbed her himself. The rings on his body didn't light up, so whatever he had done to her sister he wasn;t planning to do to her.

"I don't know what you did to get people like that on your side, but that's not important, what is important is I have you."

"So why don't the two of us pay a trip to the Royal vault? Maybe there's something in there that can deal with them." Yanny smiled.

Moving her away with his great strength, Wince tried to resist. She began to kick and scream, hitting every part of Yanny's body as hard as she could but it was doing nothing. Using her hands, she had even controlled the power of the water and created a strong slash right across Yanny's back but it still had done nothing.

"LET GO OF ME!" Wince screamed. "LET GO OF ME. I would rather die, than let you have what you want. You... you.. you..." No matter how hard she tried it was useless.

Everyone who was hiding from the battle was watching the poor princess struggle with all her might, but not a single one of them wanted to risk their own lives, stepping up to help her. Instead, they just whispered their prayers for someone to keep her safe.

"Father... I wish you were here." Wince cried out.

Her final cries had managed to reach one person, a person who was desperately fighting. The shark fish had swam straight towards him again, and rather than using the strength ability as he did before, Sil placed his hand up and grabbed its face.

He used the Qi inside his body to try and make up for the strength, but it wasn't enough and wouldn't hold out for long. His body was being dragged across the surface of the water floor but something strange was happening.

The shark man could soon feel intense pain, as the skin on his whole face was burning. Eventually, he could see boils appearing before they popped exploding right in his face. The shark man swam away in pain shaking its entire head in the water left and right, while the water was bubbling around Sil's hand.

"I can still use other abilities while down here, I just can't move so easily without the water one" Sil thought as he opened his book changing his abilities again. The next moment, he opened a portal, and pulled out a weapon, throwing it directly towards Wince.

It travelled through the water as Sil controlled it, and made it so it landed in her hand. The crying had stopped from Wince's eyes as she felt a great power, looking at the trident that had appeared in her hand.

"That belongs to you, so use it to get your planet back." Sil smiled.

***

# Chapter 1835: Blue Pearl.

At first, Wince thought the sudden turn of affairs was nothing but an illusion. In her hands was the trident, but it wasn't just any trident, rather the one that had belonged to her father, who had gone missing years ago.

His disappearance was one of the reasons why the conflict between the two factions escalated to the degree that it led to today's events.

Yet, she knew straight away that this trident was once her fathers. As a child, she had seen her father carry it many times, and she could feel the energy inside the weapon bonding with her.

Right now, she didn't care why the human had her father's trident or how he had come across it. Instead, her whole attention was on what was in her hands and how she would use it to fight back.

In the next instant, Wince lifted the trident and slammed it on the ground. A wave of incredibly strong currents with a slight blue glow began to spread out, and Yanny was knocked off his feet.

Even she was surprised by the power when she felt her whole body being pressured from all sides. The pressure was actually coming from the trident itself, but she held on tightly for her life onto the trident until it finally settled down.

Firmly putting her feet on the ground, Wince lifted the trident and started to spin the weapon. It was extremely light, and even in the water, she had no trouble using it. However, when she thrust it forward, she felt a burst of energy from the trident and three hydro pumps of water shot out from its tips.

"I didn't even try to use my powers to activate this weapon, it just did that on its own with a simple thrust." Wince smiled.

"Please, I hope you recognise me. I'm the daughter of your previous owner, and I need your help. I want to borrow your power, and I hope you grant this request of mine."

Earlier, when she saw the weapon, there was one thing she was sure of though: her father was no longer.

"Help me defeat the one that killed your last owner!" Wince pointed the trident out towards Yanny, who had just gotten up from the ground.

Not too far away, Sil had overheard the princess, and once again, he felt like someone had stuck a knife in his heart.

"I'm sorry, but he wasn't the one that killed your father. Please just use that weapon to get this over with." Sil thought.

As for his own fight, Sil was doing quite well. He was learning how to use the water ability beyond what he would have before. Even after a thousand years, it seemed like there were things that he could learn to improve his combat prowess.

"If I want to keep up with Quinn, then I'm going to have to keep putting myself in tough situations. He was asleep for a thousand years, and I only just got on his level." Sil thought.

Thinking about Quinn, Sil had come up with a nice idea to deal with the Predators in front of him. There were still the two water blades in his hand, and when the enemies were coming toward him, he threw one of the blades out. Then, he controlled where the blade went using the water currents.

Sil threw out another sword with his other hand, which chased after one of the other Predators.

"As I thought, these guys are fast, but speed won't matter soon enough." Sil, in his hand, had created another water sword and threw it out. Then there was another and then one more. Sil was swiftly making and throwing more and more water blades, and the Predators realised they had to face more of these blades around them.

"Haha, this is like a game now." Sil thought, controlling them, trying to catch his attackers. They were no longer trying to attack; instead, they were just running away.

"How much power does this guy have... what is going on?!" one of the predators explained in terror.

At the same time, some of the water blades veered off course and went close to the guards. Sil decided to move them off track and attack the guard instead, aiming to help the Sea beast that had been helping them out so far. Honestly, Sil felt a little bad, but the sea beast had attempted to kill them before all of this and was only helping because of another ability of Sil's.

"Who would have thought that the Bree family's ability would have come in handy at a time like this?"

Not too far from Sil, someone was still struggling, and it was Doguth. He had been hit several times, and although he felt more power, at the same time, he felt more vulnerable due to the lack of oxygen that was getting out of his body.

"I can't keep focusing on all five of them. I should take them out one by one."

After making the decision, he started focusing his eye on just one of the Predators swimming around him, and it was none other than Mokoon. He hadn't done much so far, which is why Doguth assumed him to be the weakest, and right now, just lowering the number of enemies he was facing was the best thing for him to do.

Focusing his eyes, he fired lasers at the target and also started to move ahead. Mokoon, noticing this, had started to swim in the opposite direction, and the predators had all split up before coming at the Dalki like five torpedoes. However, not all of them were here.

"Where's that Hammer-head?" Doguth frowned.

Turning to his right, he suddenly noticed that the Hammerhead shark predator was ready, and instantly, he swung his head while holding the two arms of the Dalki to deliver a decisive blow on the latter's skull. Far stronger than before, there was a current following behind, giving him more power.

Each predator had some control over the sea, influencing it to give more power in their strikes.

"Why don't you just freeze." A voice said, and suddenly, the area around the hammer shark was frozen in seconds. The Hammerhead was unable even to see his own body being frozen.

Then, coming out from the area was none other than Sil.

"Well, you can do the honours of smashing him up." Sil said.

"You... you have the power of ice?" Doguth replied in shock.

Thinking that in the sea like this, it was certainly a dangerous ability to have, he wondered why he hadn't used it. On top of that, he wondered what had happened to his other opponents.

Turning his head, the Dalki suddenly noticed Sil was still away from him, fighting against the other predators.

"Wait... there are two of you?"

"Let's just focus on what is in front of us, shall we? Besides, we're not doing any of this for us. All of this is for the princess." Sil replied as he got ready to help the Dalki.

—— —— ——

The fight between Yanny and the princess was on. She was confident with the trident held in her hand, and there was a boost in power. Quickly, she could swim in the sea above and began to spin the trident above her.

Power was gathering in the weapon, and she swung it down towards Yanny. Seeing this, the octopus gathered four spikes of water in its hands and threw them out towards the weapon, but princess destroyed them in seconds.

"That damn trident!" Yanny shouted as the lightning hit his arm. Sparks of energy collided, and a marking on his head started to glow.

There was a reason why all the predators were far stronger compared to the others, and it was because of the gift and marking they had all received.

With the marking on his forehead empowering him and his attacks, he went to punch Wince with all of his arms, but she was quickly able to move the trident, knocking his punches away one after another, and then she thrust it forward again.

Yanny had jumped back, avoiding it from stabbing him, but was hit by the hydro blasts soon after, which pushed him back and through the sea.

"I knew that trident was going to give me trouble! Why has it appeared now?!" Yanny shouted in frustration. This wasn't the first time he was dealing with the trident, and he was well aware of its prowess, which was why he was alarmed as soon as he saw the trident.

"Forget it. If you're going to fight with help, then so am I."

Opening his mouth wide, a strange large blue pearl had come out of it. The pearl itself was radiating with energy, and suddenly all of the predators in the area were reacting to the energy as well.

"We who complete your wish, help us win this battle!" Yanny commanded, and the pearl started to light up.

Sensing the energy, Sil knew what it was straight away.

"It's celestial energy, but what is that item? Is it a celestial item or the God itself?" Sil thought.

Suddenly, the currents in the deep sea started to move again, and looking around them, they could see several large shadow figures beginning to surround the entire city.

"I guess it's time we get out of here." Sil thought.

***

# Chapter 1836: Changing the System.

In the city that stayed above the water, it was even quieter than before. Quinn and Nog had been here for a while now and had seen countless people hurrying to leave the island, and eventually, the whole island had become a ghost town.

The only ones that were left were relatively old finding it difficult to travel or seemed too senile to know that something big was going on in the first place, which was why the two of them had decided to relax by the beach for a bit.

Quinn was lying down, just enjoying his peace and quiet for a while. There was no training involved, no strange mystic celestial stuff, or vampire problems to deal with. At the same time, Nog was by his side doing the same.

"Aren't you a bit worried? Those guys were strong enough to attack the Cruise ship." Nog asked. "I mean, I know you're strong as well, but aren't you a little too relaxed?"

Looking into the sky, Quinn could still see the large fleets and ships flying in the distance, in his head, he was trying to determine something.

"I think I can do it," Quinn mumbled.

"Sorry?" Nog replied, not hearing fully what he had said.

"I'm not worried because Sil is there. Sil will be able to handle whatever comes his way, and if he needs help, I'm sure he can send some sort of signal for me." Quinn replied relaxingly.

It was then that Nog stood up, and unlike Quinn, he had relaxed plenty of times before, and he was worried about the captain. Yes, the captain was strong, but to go up against a whole army, just with four people, sounded a little ridiculous.

"Well, if you need me, then you can just send me a signal as well," Nog replied, walking towards a pier that was set out on the beach.

There was no hydro station at this section, and instead, it looked like a small little boat activity had been set out. People could rent out boats. They would then use them to explore the vast sea and surface.

Heading to the area, it didn't look like the staff had also left the island, so Nog decided to hop in. The boat was round, and it wasn't really a boat but looked more like a pod spaceship. However, it couldn't fly.

When he pressed on the accelerator, like on a car, the boat started to move, and there was also a steering wheel to direct it. The little vehicle was faster than Nog had thought as it skidded across the water like a Jet Ski.

"Whoa, now this is more like it!" Nog said with a huge grin on his face as the vehicle bumped up and down on the waves. For a second, Quinn had peeked at Nog but then leaned back to relax.

"Just be careful that some giant sea monster doesn't come and kill you," Quinn muttered.

He wouldn't really be surprised if the sea monster suddenly popped out, but then, he was also hoping that Nog could deal with it on his own.

While exploring the sea, Nog was making a note of where he went and could see that the pod had a return home function. He assumed this was the shop, which meant he could explore as far out as he liked, and that's what he did.

He soon came across a few more islands, but there looked to be no life on them at all. Still, it was nice for Nog to experience sea travel rather than space travel. After exploring for a while, he soon spotted something out in the sea.

"What is that?" Nog slowed down the vehicle and went closer and closer to it. Opening up the glass roof of the pod, Nog took a closer look at the floating object.

"It's a person! A fish woman!" Nog shouted, expecting someone to come and help, but quickly realised that he was the only one out in the middle of the sea. So, in the end, after tossing and turning, Nog decided to jump into the water.

Pulling the body was a lot harder than he thought, but using his strength, he managed to place her on the outside of the boat and then getting himself up, he then pulled her up. Now back inside the vehicle, Nog was able to get a good look at her, and he couldn't believe it.

—— —— ——

"Quinn! Quinn, come here quick!" Nog was shouting as he parked up his boat and was holding a female in his hands.

At first, Quinn thought that maybe there really was a sea monster to deal with, but as long as he wasn't in the water, he wouldn't have a problem with sea creatures if he ran into them.

Nog quickly ran across the sand and placed the body right down in front of Quinn.

"What do we do? I just found her floating in the sea like this." Nog said, panicked.

"This is... Ceril, right? The Princess' sister?" Quinn replied. "Why was she in the middle of the ocean?"

"I don't know, but she's not breathing, and since she floated to the top, doesn't that mean she's... dead?"

Looking at her closely and pressing his hand on her body, Quinn couldn't feel a breath, and there was no heartbeat, but he could sense one thing, and that was life energy.

"Maybe... I can do something." Quinn mumbled as he put both hands on her forehead.

After sensing her Qi, Quinn started to move it toward her heart. He then controlled it, so it would start to pump itself. It didn't take long for the heart to resume beating, but that wasn't enough, Inside her, there was strange energy.

"What is this around her head?" Quinn thought as he started to move his own Qi into her body, but not too much since he knew he was now a celestial; even his Qi could react with people in different ways, just hopefully, in this situation, it was positive.

Either way, the worst that could happen to her was death; if he did nothing, she would die anyway. Eventually, though Quinn had found another Qi source in the brain, it was as if it was another living creature in the shape of something similar to a worm.

"Let's get rid of you first." Quinn directed all the Qi straight to the parasite, and with his strong power, he destroyed it in an instant. However, even after destroying the abnormal Qi, it did next to nothing.

"Is she going to be okay?" Nog asked.

"For now, I'm keeping her energy alive, but something is stopping her other organs from working. It's as if her whole body is paralysed. She needs to heal." Quinn replied.

In this situation, he felt that giving her heavenly energy would not do much, but perhaps he could do something else. In the past, if he faced a similar situation, he could always do something.

Making a small cut on his hand, Quinn placed it over her mouth.

"Let's find out if a fish vampire is a thing," Quinn wondered, letting his blood drip into her mouth while activating the blood ritual. It had been a long time since Quinn had done such a thing, and he had thought he might never have to do it again, but here he was doing it on another planet.

Unlike the time before, when one would shake and move in pain from the transformation, there was no reaction, but that was most likely due to the state that she was in.

"If this does work... will she still be addicted to blood? I guess that will be the case, and it may change the whole race ecosystem."

"I will need to deal with that later. Maybe after this is over, I will have to bring her with me." Quinn thought.

[Blood ritual has been completed]

[You have successfully, for the first time, created a new Subclass]

[Mervamp]

"A new subclass?" Quinn wasn't expecting this, and it was then that he could see and hear that her organs were starting to come back to working condition. He had somehow managed to save her, but it would be a while until she recovered.

Standing up, Quinn looked above.

"The fact that she was in that condition and is up here might mean you're right. Something is going on. Why don't we try and get them to come up here?" Quinn stated.

The blood that started to come out from the cut made on his hand had the red vampire aura with it. It started to change form and turned into a large spear made of blood, celestial energy and blood aura; on top of that, as always, Quinn would add his powers of Qi.

"What are you planning on..." Before Nog could finish his sentence, Quinn ran, instantly crossing the beach within a mere second and threw the blood spear. It left his hand and went into the sky.

Before Nog could understand what was happening, the large giant spaceship above exploded, colouring the sky in a slight orange and yellow colour.

"I knew I could hit it!" Whispered Quinn.

***

# Chapter 1837: Rise!

Having felt the large currents before and the dark figures in the sea, Sil knew immediately that these were the dangerous large sea beasts that roamed the sea. However, this city was a lot larger than the last place they were at and there were a lot more large shadows going through the sea.

"It has to be that damn blue pearl that's causing them all to come out here." Sil thought. "The question is, can he control the sea beasts, or is he doing some sort of suicidal attack?"

Sil could see that Wince was still fighting. She was thrusting her trident and was doing a good job of pushing Yanny back. In truth, the smart thing to do was for Sil to get the blue pearl and destroy it, but he wanted the princess to get her own revenge.

On top of that, it looked like his Dalki friend was at his limit with his own fight. Quinn did say to push him to the end, but at this rate, he would end up dead.

"I guess it's all up to me." Sil sighed. "Still, there is a way to solve this in a way that everyone wins in the end. It just means it's a lot more work for me."

Changing his abilities, Sil began to clone himself. He started to make more copies of himself until there were around thirty of him in total. The next step was the choice of weapons. The portal that each Sil could open up was linked to the same space so they had access to whatever weapons they wanted.

Although Sil only had around 10 demon tier items inside, he still had plenty of strong weapons for them all to choose from.

The predators who had a boost of strength from the pearl activating their celestial energy were stunned. They felt like they finally had the upper hand and then the strange human had done this.

They were unsure if the strength of each clone was the same as the original, but if the one that was helping the Dalki out was anything to go by, they felt like they were in serious trouble, and no one wanted to attack first.

"Alright everyone, it's going to be a bumpy ride but do your best to fight at whoever is going to come your way! I won't slow down for anyone!" The real Sil ordered.

The rest of them nodded, raising their weapons in the air like some type of army. Straight after each of them used the water ability to swim away. They headed to the edge of the city, spreading out and surrounding the place in a large circle.

At the same time, there were a couple that stayed in front of Sil with the demon-tier weapons and one of them had gone over to the sea beast that had helped them out.

The clone Sil soon opened a large portal the size of the giant beast and ordered it to go inside.

"You have done well and have helped us. So I don't want you to die. Although if you do die, then I promise to make you into a nice weapon." Sil smiled.

The beast listened and got into the portal which quickly closed up.

The people in the city were wondering what the strange clones were doing. Why were they on the edge of the city and why had they surrounded the place? But the next second, they somewhat understood.

A large water pump burst from the hands of one of the clones and headed straight for the dark, ghostly figure. He hit the beast, but at the same time unleashed his own Back to Force attack, firing a red laser from somewhere, but using his small dagger weapon, he was able to deflect the attack to retaliate against the beast.

At the same time, as the other large beasts were coming closer, the clones were using their strength and might to take them out as well.

"Is that person protecting us from the beasts? But why?" The townsfolk said.

"He is with the princess. She did shout about having some type of warrior on her side."

"The one that should be protecting us though, is Yanny. Not some stranger from another race. He talks about the pride of the predators but what are they doing?"

It was clear that this act from Sil was starting to turn public opinion. Seeing how strong the princess was now fighting Yanny back, the small nearly invisible hope that they had on the other side was starting to return.

The only thing was, Sil wasn't doing this to protect them. This was only the start of his plan. Now that the clones had gone away from the real Sil's side, the predators were confident once again and had charged in.

The real Sil didn't have to worry as he had left two by his side with strong weapons in front of him. Instead, he needed to focus on something else. Placing both hands on the ground, Sil was ready.

"After doing all of this, I don't know how much MC points I'm going to have left. So Dalki... Princess, it's all up to you." Light started to shine right underneath Sil's hand and in the next second the ground started to freeze.

It spread out from the area he was on, and crossed the entire floor. The fish people were relatively scared of this. They decided to float up a little so they wouldn't be touching the sea floor.

The ice continued to spread out more and more, reaching the very edges of the entire city. Even though the public didn't know how someone was capable of such a thing, they knew that one would have to have an enormous amount of power to cover such a large space, but what was the reason behind it?

"Now here comes the hard part." Sil wiped his head, as he braced himself and placed both hands on the ground again. Immediately the whole city was raised from where it was. It was moving through the sea at an incredible speed.

No longer was the city attached to the floor of the sea, but instead it was on a giant ice pillar that was getting larger by the second. Due to the force felt on their bodies, many of the Mermerials were on the floor lying flat.

"What is going on!" Yanny shouted.

After the sudden acceleration had stopped, they were now travelling through the sea. The ice pillar was getting larger and larger and the sea creatures that they had avoided had been replaced with new ones.

They were attracted by the strange object coming through the sea, through their territory and were swimming closer keeping an eye on it. Still, this was why the clones were placed on the side of the city to make sure that anything that attempted to attack them would be dealt with. Sending out a few attacks the clones were fighting off tentacles, claws and more that were coming toward them that could be seen.

One of the clones had been grabbed by a tentacle. The clone was not immediately killed but pulled deep into the water where he couldn't be seen. On top of that, with the pillar of ice still moving, they were getting further and further away from the clone.

"What is this person planning? Why is he doing this!" Yanny shouted, still holding the pearl in one of his hands, trying to summon the sea beast towards them. The entire advantage he had was ruined.

"You don't have time to worry about that!" Princess shouted as she thrust the trident forward. This time, it had been grabbed by Yanny. With a twist though, Wince was able to create several currents around it that sliced Yanny's hand causing him to bleed.

"Damn you. Damn you all!" Yanny screamed and for the first time, he could see a clear shadow on the ground. Looking up, he could see that they were now near the surface of the water.

***

# Chapter 1838: The Surface.

At first, Sil was going at a steady pace with the ice pillar moving the entire city. This was because moving it faster would require more MC points. Although Sil was a monster when compared to anyone else in terms of MC points back on Earth, this whole event had taken quite a lot out of him.

Moving an entire city, constantly freezing the water was no easy task, and on top of that he had his clones out fighting against deadly beasts at the same time. So moving the city slowly was so he would have just enough MC points to still deal with everything if they got out of hand.

If Wince had failed in defeating Yanny, if the Dalki was unable to take out the predators, and if Quinn was nowhere to be seen, then he would have to deal with everything.

Although the last statement seemed unlikely, from what Sil had heard it was quite common for Quinn to go unseen and suddenly disappear. But he didn't want to take any chances, until he had witnessed Dogthus grabbing his neck.

He had hit his limit and was gasping for air badly. It was at that moment, pushing his MC cells and powers to the max, Sil made the ice pillar move as quickly as possible and charged it through the sea.

The sea became clearer and easier to see now that the light from the sun could be seen. In the next second, the entire city crashed through the surface. It was a hard hit for the city as some of the grand structures had cracked and fallen in the process.

At the same time, all of the Mermerials were wobbly on their feet for a few seconds. Some had even been chucked airborne and landed back down due to the speed they had risen at.

The city was solid though, it didn't wobble on the surface of the water because there was a giant pillar of ice underneath it. However, after getting to the surface, Sil's job wasn't done. With his hands still stuck onto the floor, he used even more power to stretch out the surface of the ice, making it larger than the area of the city by a good kilometre or so. At the same time, he was making sure to freeze an amount of water that would be considerably thick and not break if an attack or two hit it.

Finally, after all that, Sil was exhausted and fell on his back. It looked like on the journey here, most of his clones had perished. The good thing was they each knew if they were about to die and would open up the portal shoving their weapons back in before dying.

As for why Sil had done his little ice platform at the end, it was due to him not wanting to rely on the pillar. He wanted to create his own island so if the beasts attacked the pillar from underneath, it wouldn't be a problem.

"The rest is down to you guys now." Sil smiled.

While lying down on his back, Sil noticed something strange. It was the colour of the sky. It was still quite bright but it looked almost as if the sky had turned somewhat orange and filled with dust as well.

"What is going on?"

The next second, in the distance, a large explosion had occurred beyond the sky. It looked like it was almost in space even.

"Ah screw it, let me just rest a bit... and then I'll help the others out." Sil said.

He wasn't the only one that noticed the strange colour in the sky and the explosions. The people looked up wondering what they were, but one person knew straight away.

"The fleets are being destroyed, our forces. What is happening right now? Is this all your doing?" Yanny pointed at Wince.

"I'm not sure. It might be, but you have bigger things to worry about!" Princess waved her trident and water started to gather around it. She then swiped it across the floor and a large wave hit Yanny taking him off his feet.

Leaping from her position, she slammed the point of the trident at Yanny. Lifting up his hand, he tried stopping it. But the point went right through, piercing his skin.

"Are you trying to get rid of the Mermerial race by bringing these outsiders in? If you get rid of everyone then how will we defend ourselves?" Yanny asked.

"From what?" Princess replied, twisting the trident. Water jets shot out of the trident, hitting Yanny in the body. The force took his hand out of the end of the trident and sent him across the room.

"Protect us from these imaginary threats? You're the biggest threat to our race!" Wince screamed.

—— —— ——

At the same time, there was another person that was happy that they were finally out of the water. Dogthus was on one knee gasping in the air.

"This air... I have never felt so dependent on anything before." Dogthus said to himself, as he slowly stood up from the ground. Blood was still dripping all over his body from the wounds he had before.

Seeing this, one of the predators, the Hammer-head who was close by, had decided to act thinking he was on his last legs.

The fishman now had legs instead of a fin, but he still had great running speed. The speed was not as fast as he was in the water though. He swung his head first and the dalki reached out his hand, grabbing him.

"Your attack is stronger. I can feel this energy in you." The Dalki said, as he coughed out blood. The strange power had gone through his body, but he didn't care because he knew it was only going to make him stronger. Now out of the water, he could use all the pent up damage.

Using his laser eyes, it hit the Hammer-head directly. The laser burned the skin of the body slowly as there was some resistance until eventually there was no head left. Letting go, the predator fell to the floor.

"Finally, the five spike Dalki is acting like a five spike." Sil said, still watching everything from his position. There were interesting fights all over and the clones that were still alive had come back to help him in his fight against the predators. It didn't take long for the clones to finish off the annoying predators once they were out of the water.

"Everything is going well now we're out of the water. Maybe I won't have to get involved after all. Still, there is this God that I have to worry about as well."

"Maybe, if I get the blue pearl or speak to Yanny, then we can talk to this God. I think Quinn would like that as well."

A portion of Sil's MC points had recovered. It was a small amount, but he was wondering how much he would need to fight a celestial on his own because Quinn was nowhere to be seen.

As he said that, a large shadow was cast over Sil's head. As he looked up, something fell from the sky. It wasn't just an object, it was one of the big ships in the fleet.

"Look out, take cover!" The people shouted, as they all hid in their houses. Fortunately, the large ship looked like it was heading right for the square where all of the others were fighting.

"Stop making my job harder!" Sil placed his hands on the ground making sure the ice was reinforced.

The large ship crashed right in the square, chucking pieces and bits everywhere. For a second there were some cracks in the ice, but as quickly as they appeared, Sil was fixing them.

After the initial crash, there was silence as everyone wondered what had just occurred. They could only see the spaceship.

"Hey look, there's someone there!" A person pointed.

Looking at the person standing on top of the ship. with his hair blowing in the wind, Sil smiled.

"Took you long enough"

# Chapter 1839: I'm in a rush! (Part 1)

Looking at Quinn on the large giant fleet ship, Wince had a large smile on her face. This was the person that she had relied on, the person she had put all her hopes into taking back her planet.

She just never thought that he would have such a big fear over the deep blue sea, but she was lucky that his friend, as well as the captain of the cruise, had been lucky enough to help her.

The real question on her mind, and Sil's thought was just what Quinn was doing this entire time.

—— —— ——

Back on the beach before the city had been risen by Sil above the water, Quinn had just turned Ceril into a new type of subclass. Checking out the system, he was wondering if there were any different traits to the subclass.

Usually, when creating a subclass for the first time, the system would prompt him with a load of information on the subclass. Telling him the usual traits, special powers and more but this time there was nothing.

"Is this because it's completely new, the system has no information on such a thing?" Quinn thought.

What he had done was travelled into the unknown. Quinn had given his celestial energy to the Amra race people. That didn't seem to be a problem as it hadn't changed them so much only made them more powerful.

Whoever, this was different, Quinn was using his traits as a vampire to create what was in front of him, but there was nothing that he could do for now, and it looked like she wouldn't be waking up any time soon.

"Why did you just attack that large spaceship!" Nog shouted. "Are you trying to let them know where we are?"

After destroying the ship with his large blood spear, Quinn was looking through the system to try to learn more about Ceril. To Nog, it looked like the acts of a madman, who would constantly mumble, talk to himself, or just gaze off into the distance.

Now, he had just taken a large ship as if he had grabbed a piece of fruit to eat.

"Yeah." Quinn replied.

"If the others are in trouble then we need to grab their attention and pull them up to here, and without a better way other than getting in the water, this is our only choice."

Shadow started to cover Quinn and it was the first time Nog had seen such a thing, causing him to step back.

"These humans are strange to have these mystical powers and now shadows as well?" Nog thought.

With the demon-tier chest piece now equipped, Quinn sprouted out his wings and covered them with the shadow as he usually would have.

"Look after her, and if she wakes up and looks like he's trying to eat youm, stay away from her." Were Quinn's final words as he flew up in the sky.

He flew fast and as he expected, the other smaller ships as well as the larger fleets that had been orbiting in space were heading in the direction where the attack had come from.

They were leaving space and coming closer and closer to the planet's orbit. Finally, Quinn stopped in the air, as he could see a strange pod-like vehicle. It was a see-through ball with a pilot inside. The vehicle also had two laser pointers sticking out from it.

Soon four of them were around Quinn. The larger fleet ships similar to the one that he had destroyed were slower at moving so they would take some time to reach him.

"Identify yourself or we will fire!" One of the small pod ships ordered.

"I'm looking for your leader, I think his name is Yanny. Can you please tell him to come up here so we can talk?" Quinn asked.

These people were just soldiers following orders, so if it could be avoided Quinn didn't want to just kill them.

The soldiers in the pods just laughed and Quinn could see the lasers on their ships charging up. Since they had attempted to kill him now, he felt like he had no choice. All four of them begin to fire at once.

Curling up, with his two shadow wings, the Lasers hit them, adn at the same time came back out, firing at themselves. It had come as a surprise to them and they were unable to move out of the way of the strike, causing all four of them to explode in an instant.

Leaving them to fall to the ground, Quinn didn't check if they were okay or not, his eyes were set on the large ship that had just arrived. Flying at full speed Quinn started to spin his body and narrow his wings so he went in faster like a missile.

The weapons on the large ship were unable to fire at him and before they knew it, Quinn was attached to the side of the ship. Using the regular gauntlet he had on his hand, he pierced the exterior with ease, and pulled away a large chunk of the ship throwing it to the ground.

He entered the inside and started to summon ten blades hovering around his back with the blood aura. He walked into the ship's room and started walking around looking to see if he could find anyone and it didn't take long for a group of the same people that had attacked them on the cruise ship, to arrive with their guns pointed at him.

"Please don't fire at me. I just want a way to contact this Yanny guy. If not, then maybe one of you guys knows how to get back to earth?" Quinn asked.

"FIRE!"

Once again, it was attack first and ask questions later but Quinn had been prepared for this. He covered himself with the wings, blocking all the laser shots with them. Although he could try and avoid them all with his speed, that was tiring work for these lot.

At the same time, the group were firing from all sorts of different angles for his last trick of firing back at them to work. Instead, while turtling up and covering himself with the wings.

He had his blood swords do the work. They flew through the air, gogin right through the attackers' hearts, slicing through them and continuing to travel through their bodies with ease.

They were swirling around the entire room, and their attention was focused on the blood swords, but firing at them did nothing.

In the end, there was silence as Quinn dealt with them all. Through a series of events similar to this one, he had ended up going to the main command centre of the ship and in the end destroying the ship or the captains themselves would opt to self explode the ship.

It wasn't a problem for Quinn, as he could just use his shadow space while the explosion was going off. It was time for him to move to the next one.

Using Qi, blood aura, the shadow, and very little of his martial arts he could take on anyone that was on board the ships, and eventually, he found a captain that was a little more than compliant.

After seeing three of the large ships already being destroyed it looked like he knew what was about to come next.

"Take me to Yanny!" Quinn started with the captain's head pressed against the control panel of the ship. He was getting quite frustrated that the same thing was happening again and again.

Even using his influence skill was useless because most of these guys didn't even know where he was. That is when a small blip appeared on the rader. It was close to them, and somewhat directly beneath them. Quinn had the perfect idea on how to drop down and get there quicker to show the others he meant business.

—— —— ——

All of those events had led to where Quinn was right now, standing on top of the ship.

"Who are you?" Yanny asked. "And why are you standing on one of my ships!"

Out of anger, Yanny had thrown out a whirlpool of water from his hand directly toward Quinn. Seeing this, Quinn lifted his hand and swung it. The next moment, it looked like the water just disappeared into nothing.

The third stage of Qi was enough to break up the attack that had been used.

"That... that is the person who I brought." Wince said smiling.
