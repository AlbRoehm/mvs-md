# Chapter 1660: The one who knows all.
The night sky was out and Jessica was lying all alone on the giant bed inside her room. Now that they were gone, she actually somewhat missed the company of those maids, even if they had pestered her for the better half of the day, by making her dress for what would be the worst day of her life. It was a long day going through the rehearsal and what was worse, was the fact that her future husband wasn't even there to go through it with her.

"I'm okay with this... No, I HAVE to be okay with this... you don't want to be the cause of a whole war Jessica." She thought to herself, trying to keep calm now that her mind was allowed to roam free. She knew that her privacy was just a farce. There was bound to be at least one camera in the room, from which someone should be watching her twenty four hours a day. Worse yet, people outside of the door and outside of the windows.

Grabbing one of the oversized pillows, she shoved it into her face, and proceeded to scream into it, resulting in a muffled scream. Unfortunately, it was a short lived escape, a few seconds after she was done her mind wandered yet again.

"I wonder how Lucia and the others are doing... Given how crazy things were, me disappearing should be relatively tame, right?"

"What am I thinking, of course it is the two of them even had the largest bounties in existence placed on their heads..."

"I initially thought it was because of me, but now I'm not so sure, never even found out why that happened... and I miss Minnie... She was like the small sister I never had... I hope she doesn't hate me for not saying goodbye... are they missing me as much as I?"

Jessica had only known them for a few days. With how much had happened in that relatively short time frame, it had felt like it had been far longer, though. As she thought back about how confidently she had acted towards them, believing to be an asset, rather than the onlooker she had turned out to be, a shade of red came over her and in order to cover up that embarrassment she grabbed the pillow and screamed into it once again.

"You have my condolences, Jessica, I'm sure this isn't how you wanted your life to turn out."

When taking the pillow off her head, the vampire expected to see no one. Honestly, she thought that she was just going crazy, starting to hear voices in her head, but as it turned out there actually was a hooded person standing in the centre of the room. Although Jessica had no problem in the dark, the face of the person was hidden behind the hood, yet the large staff in her hand was all the information one needed to recognise the woman.

"You... YOU!!! I did everything you told me to, and look where that got me!" Jessica shouted as she got up from the bed storming towards the woman. "How did I you even get in here? If the Chained find out, not only will you be in trouble but so will I!"

Processing the words she had just let out, Jessica decided to quiet her voice down. However, the unknown woman seemed unbothered by that prospect... that was because she had already made preparations beforehand, expecting this type of reaction.

"Even though you are in a tough situation, you have done as I asked. For all this time you've managed to keep your secret." The woman spoke.

Hearing this, Jessica paused before reaching her. She thought back to the last time the two met. It was soon after her father perished away. She had been young with no clue what to do next and in the end the one who had guided her was this woman, advising her to join the Vampire Corps.

Somehow, this woman had known that Jessica had been the child of a vampire mother and a human father, something that had been considered impossible. As such her birth had been quite the big deal, even before she had started manifesting traits of a Dhampir.

As time went on, those powers had strengthened, not to the point where she had felt an urge to fight her fellow vampires nor kill them. However, the fear that it might appear one day had consumed her on a daily basis... and then all of this mess with the Chained had started.

Seeing the person who had recommended her to go to the Vampire Corps in the first place, Jesssica wanted to somewhat blame her, yet before she said a word she realised that it wouldn't change anything at this moment.

"I may have kept the secret you told me to, but there were those who saw me." Jessica lamented.

The woman raised an eyebrow as if she was intrigued by this. "And how did they act?"

"They...didn't act at all. Actually, I'm not quite sure, some people tried to kill me like you said they would, as for the ones that were protecting me... Arghh what does this even matter in the first place? You have yet to tell me why you've come here? I haven't seen you even once in all those years, so why now? Have you come to tell me what to do next, to get me out? Or is the future you foresaw one where I marry this guy and live the rest of my life in shame?!"

There was a pause as if the woman was thinking about what to say.

"I'm sorry, but in all the futures I saw you ended up here. I advised you to enter the Vampire Corps because that should have allowed you the happiest life until now. As for what happens next, that is up to you, but you should know the consequences of that best."

"The fact is, that if you don't go through with this, there will be conflict. Honestly, my advice would be to try and get as close to the Chained as possible."

"Then when your secret is out, at least you will have a strong set of people to protect you."

"Given what you are the Vampire Corps can't protect you, you will now have to rely on others."

Hearing this, Jessica's hands were shaking.

"That's... that's your answer?!" She ran forward as fast as she could at the figure. Making sure not to use her vampire aura to attack, just in case it would alert the others. The woman in front seemed calm, not taking a step, when the fist landed upon the woman's body her figure just lit up in a golden light.

Jessica felt her hand go right through the body, and she almost tumbled to the floor herself. Looking back, the figure was no longer there. In a way, this person had been her last hope to get out of this situation and now she had been told to try to get close to the one's she disliked. Covering her face with both her hands, she was fighting back the tears.-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-

The next day the sun rose, and the events that happened yesterday felt like a dream to Jessica for a moment. Still, part of her knew that the woman had been here, but that didn't matter. Looking outside, she knew it was one day closer until the day of her wedding. She had already been informed that it would begin tomorrow.

"Miss Jessica!" A female voice called out and the next second the doors were swung wide open. Storming inside as if they were ready for war were yesterday's maids. The one at the front was holding up a scarlet red dress.

"Miss Jessica, you are to get changed into this as soon as possible, so that we can escort you to the outside grounds." The head maid explained.

Jessica was confused, for one it wasn't a white dress, and the second reason was the fact that the wedding was to take place tomorrow not today. Nevertheless, she knew that she had no real choice, so she followed the instruction.

Once getting changed, they headed out to the outside field, which was large and filled with more people than Jessica had ever seen around the Chained area. There were many unknown faces among them, though some she could recognise as public figures. Then, she also noticed that there was a large red runway carpet, leading from where the spaceships would dock to the main building.

Just up ahead, she could see several drones that were being used as cameras and immediately they went flying towards Jessica. A little flustered and embarrassed as her dress showed quite a bit of her skin, she wanted to attack the cameras but before she could a man suddenly appeared in front of her.

"This annoying clicky finger man." Jesscia thought, having seen him before she had been taken away.

"Apologies, Miss Jessica, the reporters have arrived earlier than anticipated. The leader wishes for you to do an interview with them, and also, to greet all the guests that will be arriving a day early before the wedding." The man instructed.

It made it clear to Jessica that this really was going to be a world broadcasted event.

******

# Chapter 1661: VIP Guests.
There was visible concern on Jessica's face. For one this was something that she wasn't a willing participant for. She didn't like the fact that she had to do this, and now she would need to put on a fake smile for the whole world to see.

"Damn it, damn it, damn it! This thing just can't get any worse."

As she said those words, not too far behind the countless numbers of drones. She could see groups of reporters running behind. There wasn't just one team, but it looked like streamers, as well as those from other solar systems who must have arrived just for this event.

"What do I do?" Jessica thought as she was trying to compose herself. None of the preparations she went through yesterday had gotten her ready for this.

"Don't worry, he doesn't expect you to entertain them all on your own." Clicker, as Jessica liked to refer to him, clicked his fingers again, and suddenly her soon to be husband, who she hadn't seen once since arriving, was suddenly in front of her.

"R-r-russ!" Jessica stammered, as she bowed down, holding her dress. Although she disliked this person for forcing her to play along in his farce, the vampire knew that as the leader of the Chained, Russ had to be shown a certain amount of respect.

When Jessica lifted her head, she watched his arm stretch out in her direction, a cold chill went through her body as it reminded her of the first time the two had met. However, he merely placed his hand around her shoulder and brought her in close.

"Today you look extra gorgeous. I hope you can share your smile with the world on such a beautiful day like this one." The leader of the Chained stated. It was true that the day certainly was a good one. There were fluffy white clouds showing the clear blue sky.

Of course, this was just using human standards, for vampires this was a nightmare, but of course she wouldn't correct Russ about that. The one thing she did want to speak about, was the fact that Russ own expression hadn't changed. It looked like he was trying to smile but his eyes were still showing no emotion in them.

"Thank you so much for inviting the BandV station to one of the biggest events in the world."

"The whole world is excited to find out just who has managed to capture the heart of the Chained leader, the famous man voted to be the most cold-hearted bachelor for ten years in a row!"

The reporter closest to them claimed.

He was a young man in his twenties with light blue hair. The reason he was the first one on the scene was all due to his ability which was speed. Each reporter had wanted to be the first to ask a question to the couple. They all took a step back after hearing the question that the first reporter asked.

"Damn it, they invited BandV studio here!" Another reporter thought. "Argh, they do rack up the most views so it makes sense but I swear that Aj is just asking to die young."

The other reporters had all been briefed beforehand about what questions they were to ask. More so, they were warned that if they tried to push the boundaries with the questions they asked, or in some way insinuate or insult the Chained, they shouldn't expect to come back.

For AJ though, that threat didn't matter, because he was the majority shareholder of BandV, so he could do as he wished. It was unusual for someone who was successful, had large funds to want to enter the field themselves, but it was all due to the legacy of his family.

Generations ago, his great great...great grandparents had been the ones who had filmed many great battles, but the most famous one was undoubtedly the battle between the Hero Quinn Talen against the Dalki leader Graham. A video that everyone in all solar systems would see at one point in their life.

"Step back!" Clicker shouted, and when clicking his fingers, not just the reporters but all of the cameras moved back to the landing dock once again.

"All of you should have been told the ground rules for this event, as well as the time table. Right now, Russ and Jessica are here to greet the VIP guests that will arrive at any second."

"You're more than welcome to film that and feel free to report on all details of the event regardless of what will happen."

"As for questions, they will only be allowed after the wedding has concluded. There will be a day after for a Q&A section."

"As long as you listen to what we say, we promise you will enjoy and have perhaps the best time of your life here, while also filming a piece of history."

The reporters looked a little sulky at this, but they had to try to get past that, as it really was a once in a lifetime opportunity. Soon though, the reporter's mood was looking up as they could see not just one ship, but a few ships approaching.

"It looks like his VIP guests have arrived." AJ thought. "I wonder who was invited, and who is also willing to attend."

Leading with his hand, Russ walked down the large red carpet that had been prepared while pulling Jessica along. At the same time, at either side of the red carpet, Clicker was clicking his fingers, making the other members of the Chained appear one by one.

This time, all of them were wearing high level beast gear. None of them stepped on the red carpet and didn't go past or ahead of where Russ would walk.

"Look at that." AJ reported, as he controlled the drones with his fingertips to get into view.

"Unlike other groups, each individual member of the Chained looks completely unique. It is said that there is no ranking between members which is why there are so few of them."

"The only thing we know for sure that the strongest among them is their leader, who will be getting married in a couple of days..."

Russ and Jessica just stood by and patiently waited for the ships to dock. They landed one by one, and the members inside could be seen coming out, walking towards the future groom and bride.

The first to exit from the vessel and enter the docking area, was one of the Generals for the Vampire Corps group. Most expected them to send over a small delegation, seeing as the bride was one of them, however, as it turned out, there was only a single person who had come, General Fizzwell.

As soon as he saw the cameras, immediately he started to pose straight away, getting into different positions for different shots. Fizzwell didn't look like your typical Vampire Corps General. He had short spiky hair and always seemed to wear a pair of sunglasses as well. Still, no one doubted his ability as one of the Generals leading Earth's Vampire Corps unit.

Next, coming off one of the other ships, was a young short female, with rough looking hair. The strangest thing was the actual mount that she was on, resembling a large lion, whose mane was constantly on fire. Even stranger, the little girl, or more accurately, the short woman named Pinky Bree, was seemingly completely unbothered by the fire.

After the cameras filmed the individuals, Russ and Jessica went ahead to greet their newcomers with the man doing all the speaking. He told them to follow Clicker's arrangement who would place them in their room and update them on the schedule for two to three days.

Then, there was the Green family, head of the main military.

"Now this is a surprise!" AJ Commented.

"Do they see the Chained as this much of an important ally?"

The reason for his comment was because everyone who wasn't living under a rock would recognise the representatives. Jake Green, humanity's strongest fighter, could be seen coming forward waving towards the camera and behind him was Vicky Blade. Immediately, several of the drones blocked their path as they wanted to film everything.

That was when two others descended from another spacecraft and together.

"So they really came, huh." Jake said to his mother, staring in the direction of the other pair. As soon as he had seen the ship, he had known that it was from Pure, but that wasn't the surprising thing. No, he had expected the high ranking agent from Pure, unlike the young blonde female Dhampir who had been at the meeting.

The cameras moved from Jake Green and immediately went to the others, which Jake was a little upset about, but just clicked his tongue.

"Please, you guys go first, I wouldn't want to be stabbed from behind." Jake commented loudly to the two.

Walking ahead, they seemed unbothered by his snide remark, and when meeting with Russ and Jessica both were respectful to the Chained leader.

"Thank you so much for inviting us and allowing me to bring a guest." The large red headed Pure agent stated, a large number one had been stitched on the back of his jacket.

When Jake and Vicky walked ahead, everyone knew that this was a tense moment for the world. The disliking was public knowledge.

"It's great to see that the Green family has taken this seriously, although frankly, I was hoping to see Logan himself." Russ looked at Vicky, mostly ignoring Jake.

"Am I not good enough?" Jake replied, and was doing his best to keep his anger in.

"I didn't say that, both of you are certainly good enough... for the Green family. However, I believe I also invited the Blade family to this event as well. You know, I don't regard you as part of the Blade family." Russ was clearly addressing Vicky. "I hope a true Blade will also attend."

"I must have missed the meeting which gave you any say who was or wasn't a Blade" Vicky replied sharply. "But don't worry, one of them should also come."

*****

# Chapter 1662: The power
It wasn't common to see these figures all in one place. For starters, the Dhampirs weren't even an officially recognised group, unlike the Red Vampires. To the humans and the other groups, both of these factions were seen as a nuisance to their goal. In the end, the other factions were, in some way, just looking out for the humans.

Whereas these two groups had their own agenda and cared more about that than what the general populace wanted, which was why all of the reporters and news channels were going crazy. The event was trending on online platforms more than it had ever been.

The Chained were a hot topic, but just a wedding like this wouldn't be so big if it weren't for the people who were arriving as guests.

'And now we know that another Blade will be coming. I wonder who it will be.' Aj thought.

Clicker had directed the other guests to their respective lodgings. The staff then informed them about what they could do in the room and where they could go. Of course, the Chained were treating them like guests and wanted them to enjoy their time here, so there weren't many restrictions on their end.

However, the reporters were still outside. They, too, would be given a place to stay, but they were a second priority to the Chained, and they continued to point their cameras and drones towards the sky, waiting for a ship to approach, but none had arrived.

Clicker clicked his fingers, planning to send both Vicky and Jake away. They were the last of the guests that had arrived so far, but nothing occurred when he clicked his fingers. The two were still standing there in front of him, and Jake just had a large smile on his face.

(MT Novel. Com)

"The Green family has been cooperating with the Chained for now," Jake said. "And although I trust you guys to do nothing to me, I can't say the same for my mother. Did you think we wouldn't have some countermeasures against your ability and would let you just teleport us away?"

It was unexpected, and Clicker didn't know what to do as he looked at Russ for an answer. Of course, this little problem had caused the reporters to move their cameras back towards Jake.

'What Jake is saying makes a lot of sense. Clicker could have always teleported the two to separate areas. Then, with the rest of the Chained, he could attack Vikky Blade…but the Chained would never do that. Their leader just said, on the way, he recognised Vicky Blade more as a Green than as a Blade. And he knows better not to harm Logan Green's wife.' Aj thought, which was why he was interested.

Jake should know all of this, so perhaps he was antagonising them for a different reason, that or he was just close to the Blade family as well, being a son from the two families.

"It is fine. It looks like the last guest might arrive at another time, and I will come here and welcome him personally when he arrives. In the meantime, I can take you to your room personally and give you a tour." Russ explained.

To this, Jake smiled, and Clicker did his job of getting rid of the rest.

Russ was doing as said, giving both Jake and Vicky an almost personal tour of the whole area. There certainly was a beautiful theme throughout the place because of the wedding day. In particular, Jake noticed the use of red roses.

They looked beautiful, but the vast amount of red roses was drastic, to say the least. They spiralled up pillars along with the floors and were nearly in front of every venue.

"You must have every red rose on earth here!" Jake shouted in surprise.

"It looks beautiful." Vicky couldn't help but tell the truth. "It seems you must really care for your wife."

"Of course," Russ answered immediately. "Only the best for my future bride to be, and I chose what I thought suited her the most. Don't you think these red roses have formed a sea of blood?"

The two of them looked at Jessica for answers, and she didn't know what to say. She had never seen someone go through so much effort for her.

'But…I know...he doesn't really like me.. I can tell...this is all appearance for the others and the TV.'

"It really is beautiful, thank you, Russ," Jessica replied with a smile.

She thought about what the mysterious stranger had said to her early and about seeing everyone today. It made it clear to her just how important her role was.

——

The guests enjoyed the resort as if it was a five-star hotel, and the Chained catered to their every need. The reporters, during this time, were also able to enjoy the facilities, and each person was able to film who they wished, apart from Russ.

So instead, they were trying to get answers from the likes of the Vampire Corps, Pure and the other groups. However, for Aj, none of this was good enough. He didn't want to get what anyone else could get. His stream had to be special.

'That Blade…it would be good to look at who will arrive. Maybe I should try to get out of the resort and go back to the landing dock to see them first. I would have to sneak or run past the Chained. Even if I'm caught, I doubt they would hurt me.' He thought while standing by an open window and staring at the bright sky.

But just then, he suddenly frowned. He had heard a noise. To be more specific, it was of someone crying. After a moment of consideration, he swiftly ran without using the drones, not to make it obvious. And then, as he came closer to the sobbing noise in one of the large hallways, he came to a halt and peeked around a corner.

Here he saw the sunlight shining down upon a certain individual wearing a red dress, and it didn't take him long to recognise who this person was. If this person were in a crowd, she would be the first to get noticed, but right now, she was on her own, and from her state, it was clear that she had been crying for some time now.

"What are you doing, Jessica? Get it together…you have to marry this person." The person said to herself, and she was indeed Jessica. "You have to...you have to not care about your own feelings…and forget about them."

Seeing this sight, Aj didn't know what to think, but he clearly understood that…this girl clearly wasn't happy. His habit, in the end, got the better of him as he decided to film this scene. He zoomed in, capturing her teary face.

But it had just been a few seconds when he began to film when he heard a loud bang out of nowhere.

'What was that?' Aj thought, instinctively lowering his head and going fully on alert. On the other hand, Jessica had a similar reaction as panic spread across her face.

Quickly, Aj peeked out of a nearby window and saw multiple ships approaching the area.

Before he could react, an announcement rang throughout the resort,

"Please do not be alarmed. Someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed and chose to attack us. But please don't worry. The Chained will handle it without any hassle."

He noticed about five medium-sized vessels when looking out the window, which meant the enemies numbered around 200. It wasn't a small attack force, and it was indeed a surprise.

But with the people here, Aj wondered who was brave enough to initiate an attack. Running through the resort, Aj wanted to get in the best position to film, but he noticed many in the resort, including the servants, weren't even phased by the sudden arrival of unknown enemies.

While taking a moment to catch his breath, Aj stopped to ask one of the nearby servants why they weren't scared or worried?

"Why would we need to be? The Chained are strong, and you know that. They have many enemies throughout the world, and they get attacked multiple times by different factions. Also, this time, I feel we might even get to see our Leader fight."

Hearing this, Aj rushed outside and saw that Clicker and four other members of the Chained were indeed already out. And in front of them was the leader, Russ, himself.

"Well, well, well," Jake commented from his room's window. "Will you look at that? It seems that the Chained will put on a little show for us, and I think we will see how much of a help they can be to us."

# Chapter 1663: Hiding powers
In the past, the Originals were a world-renowned group. There were two meanings to this word—they were the ones who originally had the power, and later on, they taught their abilities to the whole world. The second were the ones who, during the Dalki war, decided to keep their powers to themselves and did not share them with the public.

The second definition of originals became more apparent later on as they grew with power. These secretive groups would become some of the strongest factions, families and travellers. And with how much time has passed, the world now thought they had access to every ability so far.

Even from the other Originals who had tried to keep their abilities secret. Perhaps the former didn't know how to teach or use the ability of the other Originals, but they knew of them. However, this all changed when the world came to know of the existence of the Chained.

Although their abilities perhaps wouldn't be classified as the strongest, they certainly had original and interesting abilities that the world had yet to see. At the same time, some were strong, incredibly strong, and they were the reason behind the rise of the Chained in terms of power and prestige.

''There are still many powers within the Chained that we don't know about. Today will be an exciting day indeed.'' Aj thought. Although he wasn't the only reporter filming the scene, he was the only one who had risked his life and had left the establishment to take a close-up footage of the incoming battle.

Almost everyone invited to the resort was now witnessing what was about to occur. All of them were standing at the edge of the large windows to see everything clearly.

Because the Chained were not the aggressors in this situation, and with the people and the reporters present at the scene, they had the right to defend themselves from this attack, which was why no one was going to interfere in the ensuing fight.

The audience could see Clicker stepping up. He snapped his fingers a few times, and each time he would, someone would teleport beside him. These new arrivals were four men and one female, clad in beast armours, they all had a distinctive look.

Each of them had a smile plastered over their face as if they were excited to face the enemy. What was surprising about the whole thing though, was that Russ, the leader of the Chained, was also out on the field.

The area was surrounded by mostly forested land. And after a few moments, Clicker snapped his finger for one last time and brought over another person on top of the other five. This person immediately put his hands on the ground, and it suddenly began to shake.

The whole forest, from trees to pebbles, everything bega to move to the side. Everyone knew this was the Earth ability, but the scene itself was amazing. Giant landmasses, even bigger than the whole resort, were being displaced by one person.

The forest parted as the ability pushed the trees to the side, revealing dark soil underneath.

"It seems like the Chained also has normal ability users," Aj commented. "And they can't be weak if they can move that large amount of earth…but there's something strange about this...why is it so slow?"

Although the landmass was moving, it was moving at a slow speed. It was as if a low Earth ability user was making a move but had a high amount of MC cells, and this didn't make sense based on all their knowledge so far.

Or perhaps it was just a talented person with a high amount of MC cells who didn't quite know how to use the ability yet. Either way, it wasn't important, and it seemed even more so since Clicker clicked his fingers to make the man disappear.

"The Hunters are here today to get the large bounty on your head!" A loud voice boomed from the ship leading the enemies. It looked most impressive and was clearly the most powerful amongst them. "We've been planning this for a long time, and what better time and day to do it than today! The whole world will be our witness!"

"The Hunters are a strong faction that rather than prioritising hunting beasts, go for bounties instead. They go primarily for bounties on criminals and the like." Aj reported to his viewers. Due to him being directly on the field and recording a closer view of the action, most viewers had switched to his reporting channel.

"Although there is no public bounty out there on the Chained heads or the Chained leader as they are an officially recognized group, the Chained are infamous for their past actions and covering up a lot of their wrongdoings. This has caused many Underground and private groups to put Bounties on the individual members of the group. And those bounties are most likely these Hunters' goals!"

….

Amongst the people whom Clicker had brought out on the field, was a young woman with a dark skin tone and large frizzled hairstyle. However, what seemed most striking from her appearance were her pupils: they were white, as if she was straight out of a horror movie.

Her name was Fizzle, and she also had the least amount of armour on her. In fact, it looked like she was wearing nothing at all apart from what was on her legs. The beast armour made her legs appear twice the size and was glowing with a strange blue energy.

It was a demon tier piece of equipment, which the others in the group also possessed. During the first Dalki war, the discovery of beasts was short-lived, and it was the same as demon tier beasts. As time went on, people discovered and passed down demon tier beasts, armours and other legendary tier items such as this.

Rather than using her legs like many expected, Fizzle just placed her hands out to the side. Many expected something spectacular to happen, like the ships suddenly falling out of the sky, but no such thing ensued.

In the end, as usual, it was Clicker who had acted. He snapped his fingers, though it wasn't to teleport the ship but to teleport someone from the group. And in the next moment, a man, garbed in gladiator-like armour with a red-feather helmet on his head, appeared right below the incoming ships.

He then raised both of his hands, and immediately, two of the ships lost control and crashed to the ground as if an invisible force had hit them. It was a heavy explosion as the ships slammed into the ground and turned into hundreds of metal pieces, creating craters on the surface. All this happened so swiftly that those two ships didn't even get to use their thrusters to escape.

Shocked by this, the other ships moved and instantly began to descend. This was the only viable option because the man in front of them could simply swat them into the ground as if they were flies.

On the other side, Clicker was getting ready to move him into position but decided not to snap his fingers. When the ship landed, masses of people began to step out and were prepared to fight, although they had already lost plenty of their morale after witnessing the strength of the man.

Still, the hunters' leader, who was at the very front, spread out his hand, and with it, a solid form of blue lighting went out directly toward the lone man who had destroyed the two ships.

The man who stood out on his own and was part of the Chained went by the name of Lock. Upon seeing the incoming attack, he simply folded his arms.

"The Hunters faction leader was originally a strong lightning user from the Graylash family. Before I say anything else, I want to remind you that not all lightning users are part of the Graylash family, and some have even defected from that group, just like this person." Aj commented.

It was clear to see how and why, with such a strong ability and being able to use it efficiently, this person had become the leader of a strong bounty hunting faction and where they had gotten their confidence from.

Still, Lock wasn't scared, and just then, another man appeared beside him. He had a square face and went by the name, Cube. At the perfect moment, just as the lightning was about to hit, Cube swung his arm, and the lighting suddenly got reflected and turned towards the hunters.

In doing so, the lighting strike went directly to the large group of people and pierced a member of the Hunters. And because of its intensity, the lightning bolt struck five others next to him, hurting and injuring them on the spot.

"Return now," Russ said, walking over with the others following him. "Today is meant to be a joyous day, and I do not wish to get my hands bloody."

The Hunters' leader looked nervous, but he knew he had the advantage in numbers, even with two of his ships being destroyed. But there was one thing making him hesitate, and it was the fact that the leader of the Chained had yet to act.

'I never thought we could beat the Chained, but I at least thought we could have put up a good fight. Show how strong we were and get some recognition and extra gold, but…we have already lost a lot of people.'

Seeing his men physically in pain next to him and by his own lightning bolt no less made it, so he had to decide.

"We will retreat!" He hollered. Not knowing all abilities of the Chained was a significant disadvantage to them. He had initially thought that his lightning powers would have given him the upper hand, but it was now useless because the enemy could simply reflect the lightning strike towards his people.

As the hunters retreated, it looked like Russ was keeping his word, as he did nothing but watch the aggressors leave and enter their ships. They then flew up, and it looked like they were ready to run from the Chained faction gladly.

The reporters were a little disappointed that they didn't get to see more fighting but were still a bit satisfied that they could film something interesting. The ships hovered for a bit as they were ready to power through to head back to where they went until both of the ships turned towards the main ship.

There was a sudden silence on the field, and as everyone held their breaths, the ships suddenly zoomed right into each other and caused a giant explosion in the sky.

This scene left everyone witnessing the incident wondering what had happened and just what other powers were the Chained hiding.

# Chapter 1664: The diffrence in time
Looking outside the ship's windows, Quinn could tell that the Earth that he once knew looked quite different from before. Back then, few satellites surrounded the Earth. Later, most of them were destroyed by the Dalki in order to sabotage the humans in the war.

This situation forced humans to create and rely on different technologies if another threat like the Dalki might appear. After a thousand years since the Great War, Earth now has many layers of defences. For one, there were fleets of ships that would just encircle the Earth.

The spaceships were in different colours and flew just to specific zones. One such group of spaceships had a green tint on them. They also clearly had several other weapons on board and were equipped with mechs. It didn't take much to speculate that the Green family owned this fleet.

As for the other ships, the technology didn't seem too far behind. But the material was a hard blue, almost looking like a flying crystal of some sort. It was a material Quinn couldn't recognise, nor had he seen before. He couldn't help but assume that people most likely discovered this material in the vampire or beast planet solar system during his slumber.

Even during his time, it looked like humans were still discovering new things about the beast solar system, and now they had the vampire solar system as well.

At the same time, there were large round objects that looked a little bit like small planets. However, they were clearly artificial, made of different types of material and more.

"I guess this would have made it difficult for us to approach Earth. There are so many defence forces set up." Quinn commented.

"Correct," Lucia answered. "This is why we needed someone in high ranking, like Andy, to take us there. I don't doubt your strength, but I imagine that space battle is a different story compared to a 1000 years ago. Even though Pure and the Green family don't see eye to eye, the space division of both groups rarely fights against each other since they are a force set up to protect Earth if an unknown third party ever attacks it."

"Something else, like what? Aliens?" Peter chuckled.

"Maybe," Lucia replied back, not finding the former's words amusing. "You could consider the beasts that we discover on each of these planets as Aliens. New types of beasts and demon tier beasts are discovered all the time...and that's only from the three solar systems that we know. There could be more out there. Although Pure and Green are fighting for Earth and humanity, the last thing they want is Earth to be destroyed by an outside force."

The ship headed straight for Earth, and a fleet from the green coloured ships surrounded the ship they were on, but it looked like the defensive spaceships did this to protect Andy from being attacked. And eventually, when their spaceship entered the Earth's atmosphere, Quinn noticed that a lot of the land had been developed, but not as a living area.

The current Earth was now mostly covered with an endless number of military bases.

'They say they are fighting for the people…' Quinn thought to himself, seeing this. 'Yet, every family that just lived on earth for peace is now living off the planet.'

While thinking about the current state of the world, Quinn's eyes landed on a city that looked a bit more habitable, but the most eye-catching thing about it was also a spherical bubble enveloping it.

The bubble itself was slightly see-through but would give off a green tint, and it looked like a forcefield of some sort.

The city looked even more impressive because it was 'constructed above the ocean'. Giant towers were rising out of the water, which then supported enormous platforms, and these platforms were the building blocks of the city.

Then finally, there was the main building, which was taller than the others and was the most eye-catching because it had a giant energy ball constantly sparkling above it. It was like a beacon of light connected to the forcefield around it.

"It's a pretty eye warming sight. This city is where you have been trying to get to…because this is where Logan Green lives." Lucia commented. "There are only two places where humans can live on Earth if they aren't involved in the fighting.

"One of them is the System City, which you're currently looking at. This city is from the mind of Logan Green. He's always looking for ways to expand it by researching ways to create an artificial landmass and for humans to live on large water bodies. The other is Pure's base, which has gone for a similar but unique idea called Moving city. You'll see why it's called that if you ever visit it. Since both of their leaders live there, it's the most protected place on Earth, and that's why everyone considers it to be the safe haven of this planet.'

"So far, none of these cities have experienced an actual attack. Pure and Green are not enemies. You can consider them as two political groups with extremists on either side. At least that is how it is to the Public. Some believe that once one side gets regional dominance over the other, this balance will instantly fall apart."

——

Upon hearing her explanation, Quinn had a better understanding of the current situation, but it still made him wonder. What happened to Leo and Sera, who had sworn to destroy Pure. Something big must have happened in the last millennia for Pure to get such a strong foothold on public opinion.

The ship landed at the main vampire corps base, which looked like the one on Mars, but it was far more extensive in scale. There looked to be around 10,000 or so vampires based here, which was a considerable amount.

Quinn couldn't help but feel strange upon seeing so many vampires in one place, and the numbers were even more than that of a settlement. This sight confirmed one thing: there didn't seem to be a population problem for the vampires or humans anymore.

Though, one thing that didn't change even after a thousand years was the atmosphere around the vampire bases. The bases have always had a dark vibe around them, and even the buildings were painted black, with a faint yellow glow coming from the crystals. Quinn was used to this, and he had no problem seeing everything with his powerful eyesight.

However, instead of a tour or being welcomed, Quinn's group was almost secretly escorted through the buildings and were not even allowed to interact with any other vampires until they reached an area that seemed like a docking spot for multiple ships.

Looking around, the group noticed Andy had cleared the place off of any staff, and only he was present at the scene. Even the guards who had escorted them had turned around and left.

"This is as far as I can take you," Andy said without any delay, "The ships here are currently recognised as one of our own. You can leave the base using any ship you wish, but I will report the ship as stolen after that. This way, anything you do once you have left won't be linked to us."

Quinn nodded at Andy, who looked worried while handing over a key fob that the group would use to access the ship.

"Quinn… I'm sorry I couldn't help more." Andy said. "But I hope you really do try to talk to them instead of fighting against them. Or maybe, just kidnap Jessica?

You should know about the Blade family, and I am sure you're also aware of their real strength. The Blade family is strong, and not even they were able to get rid of the Chained. The former even attempted to exterminate the Chained but failed, and in the end, they had no other choice but to let the latter settle down."

Hearting this did make Quinn wonder a little bit. The Chained was a group that was once captured by Hilston. And Sil, whom Quinn knew beforehand, if he's still alive today, should have been as strong as Hilston, if not stronger. Either something had happened to Sil, or Hilston was somehow able to capture people even stronger than he was. The situation was peculiar, to say the least."

Also, from what Quinn had noticed of Jake Green and Vicky, he knew that the Chained would be strong.

"What about you?" Quinn asked. "Will you be okay?"

Although Andy wasn't helping him much, the man in front of him was still one of his closest friend's son. Thus, Quinn felt inclined to ask.

"I am quite stronger, stronger than you know, and I am confident that I could even give you a run." Andy replied with a smile, "Although I lost that wrestling match, I haven't revealed all my cards. There is a reason why the Chained won't touch me…so don't worry about me. But take note of another thing: many groups respect the Chained faction's power, and they might even do anything to stop you from succeeding.

"So it won't just be the Chained you are up against, and remember it's been a thousand years since you went into slumber. Everyone had a thousand years to get stronger while you were sleeping."

The two shook hands before they left and mutually decided to wash off any bad blood they had behind them. Their paths will now take them in different directions.

Boarding the ship, Mitchell was given the coordinates of their next destination. They would have to fly steadily and stealthily, maybe even stop multiple times so as not to make anyone suspicious of them. Either way, they would eventually get there.

Onboard the ship, while trying to kill their time, they stumbled across the live streams taking place and following Aj's broadcast, they witnessed quite a few surprising sights. For one, Quinn had no idea that they had already captured Jessica.

Still, it didn't change the fact that he was going there to talk to the Chained. And now, it just meant they needed to get there quicker. And while on the way, they witnessed the rest of the happenings at the resort.

'That…Agent 1…it's Chris from Pure... he's still alive?' Quinn frowned. 'A thousand years to get stronger…I wonder how strong you have become?... And they even mentioned there's someone from the Blade family coming as well. It looks like I might see a familiar face after all.'

# Chapter 1665: Plan C
The group was still currently travelling around Earth, making frequent stops whenever they sensed incoming trouble. It was so they wouldn't catch the attention of the other cities, Vampire Corp's bases and the other factions.

It was a good thing Mitchell had come along with them since he could use the information provided by Andy to let them avoid any trouble. Apparently, Andy had left them more than just the directions to where the Chained faction's base was.

He also informed them of the routes all the Vampire Corps base would have and the patrols they would do. It was something Mitchell understood well and had often performed during his time as a Lieutenant in the Vampire Corps.

Currently, the group had stopped over an inhabited piece of land.

There had to be some nature and greenery for the Earth to remain habitable. So there were just, in general, protected areas where there would be next to no fighting.

The whole group had deboarded and rested in one of these jungle-like areas known as the Amazon Rainforest. They had camped close to a river where they could wash up and go over their following plans.

"We'll be here for a few hours, so use this time to rest. We still have a day before the wedding, and I doubt anyone would expect us to come." Mitchell informed the others.

"This place reminds me of where Arthur used to train all the time!" Minny said, sitting on a rock. She reminisced about the beast planet where she was raised and lived with her mother. Tears started to flow down her face, and it looked like there would be an outburst in a few seconds.

"Minny!" Quinn called out with his arms folded. "Tears will do nothing. Remember this: if you don't want to cry in the future, then there is something you can do... get stronger."

Although Minny was young, the world around her was full of conflicts and battles, even if it's been more than a thousand years and even after what Quinn had sacrificed. He never thought she would need to protect herself with him around, but it looked like he was wrong about that.

Also, giving her a goal to focus on would take her mind off of the past and even help her overcome the bad memories. Sure enough, it seemed to work as she wiped her tears off her cheeks and nodded with a look of determination.

Since the group would be there for a couple of hours, Quinn did something that almost surprised everyone when he lifted his hand, and suddenly as if out of the sky, a female dropped down, falling face first on the floor.

"Right." Quinn looked at his hand as if he had done something wrong because it was the first time taking someone out of the shadow lock one's body would come out limp like that.

When standing up, Quinn could see that the person's body was covered in injuries and only now were they starting to heal.

"You... You brought her!" Lucia shouted, not surprised by the wounds but the person who had appeared in front of them.

"I had my reasons." Quinn replied.

"She helped us out before and she will continue to help us out now We have someone from the 'Graylash' family, The Vampire Corps and now the Red Vampires as well. Information is essential and each group has different information that we can use. She promised that she would follow us, and she will prove that by helping us out."

He did get some intense stares from Lucia and Minny, who no longer liked Hannah, but Quinn was more concerned about the wounds. Then it hit him....

"You didn't have anything to do with this? Did you, Ray?" Quinn asked.

"I knew what you had planned and I believe she wasn't up to the task. However, now she will be more willing to complete the task than before." Ray answered.

Quinn could only imagine what had occurred inside and was hoping his other two prisoners that the others didn't know about were alright. He had wanted to return the dhampirs but never quite found the right time.

With Hannah now added to the group, they went through what they had planned to do. According to Mitchell, it was impossible to just arrive at the Chained faction without getting detected.

The other party would know that they were coming, so it would be useless even if Quinn was to put them all in his shadow. There were still two options to approach from the front during the ceremony and hope that the Chained would be open to a discussion.

The other method would be to approach Jessica and try to get her out, but with that, they would be the target of the Chained.

"If only we could convince Andy to help us." Lucia said while smacking her lips.

"Maybe then the Chained would have been open for communication and you could have just revealed who you are to them. But if we were to go now, claiming you were the Hero Quinn, they would never meet with us."

"Then the second option will be best. The red vampires are already seen as enemies of everyone. So after you take Jessica back, then you can... can... stay with us?" Hannah said, stealing glances at Quinn and every time she would, she would turn her head away.

Looking at her expression, the others noticed a tinge of blush across her cheeks.

"Either way... if the red vampires know who you are, they will all lay their lives for you... Qui...Qui." She couldn't even say his name and the word got stuck in her throat every time she tried to pronounce it.

It all felt surreal, but she had plenty of time earlier to get over her initial reaction upon learning whose shadow space she was trapped in.

"Haha, all of you forget that there is a third option," Peter said with his arms folded.

"We just take Jessica back and just kill anyone who tries to stop us."

"Killing bad uncle!" Minny shouted.

"Okay, we beat them until they no longer want Jessica."

Those who knew of the Chained thought it was a crazy idea, including Mitchell, who didn't hesitate to speak up.

"Look, I do not doubt that Quinn is probably the strongest existence on this planet at this moment," Mitchell started.

"However, the Chained aren't just strong because of one person or ability. They are some of the best known for synchronising the use of their abilities and we would be going right into their home."

"With just us... I don't think we could forcefully get Jessica."

The others glanced at Quinn, waiting for his response.

"We have enough power with just us as a group."

"Honestly, it would have been best to have Logan Green first if possible, but this is a more gone to urgent matter for now."

"Either way, I have a couple of trump cards up my sleeve and you are one of them." Quinn pointed towards Mitchell.

At first, Mitchell was surprised by this. Him? A trump card of the legendary Hero Quinn? Sure he was a strong vampire that could perhaps go up against the weakest member of the Chained, but that was it.

"You have my energy inside of you, just like Peter has. You are already stronger than before." Quinn replied in a matter-of-factly way.

With still some time left, the group decided to use this as an opportunity to assess Mitchell. It was to help him get used to the Celestial energy from within, just like Peter had done.

"When trying to use the energy, Peter said that he had an image in his head and his body transformed to suit that image."

"If we assume that the same is with you, you should be able to do something as well." Quinn explained.

They had already tried to differentiate the different energies and it was easy to do with Quinn there. He could suppress the red energy, so Mitchell only felt the Celestial energy. After that, Mitchell just had to find the celestial energy himself, which didn't take long.

"Well, here it goes" Mitchell said as he started to gather the energy and almost immediately, a red glow began to emit from his body....

-BOOM!

The transformation was over and he was lying on the floor on his knees, grabbing his arm. While in front of him, where a green forest was just a second ago, nothing existed as far as eyes to see.

"I'm starting to think that Peter's plan... might actually work." Hannah commented, breaking the awkward silence.

*****

# Chapter 1666 - Haunting past

Celestial energy was undoubtedly a powerful tool. At least in a way to power dedicated followers as the energy amplified their strength hugely. However, there were a few differences between when Mitchell transformed and when Peter transformed.For one, the level of strength; even when Quinn gave the same amount of celestial points as he did Peter, Mitchell didn't have the same strength as Peter.

This was tested later on after Mitchell had some time to rest. The two of them fought, and there was a clear winner. It looked like the base strength of the person still had a significant impact as well. That also brought up another matter.

Mitchell also needed time to recover after transforming, which Peter did not, even if Mitchell wasn't hurt in battle. Just the change in his body seemed to cause pain all over. It was hard to tell whether this was due to Peter being a Wight or because Peter's body was able to hold more energy.

The reason for thinking this was because Peter's body could hold more energy. There was a point when Quinn was giving out celestial energy to the two, and Mitchell claimed it hurt too much, to the point where he could no longer move because he was attempting to hold the celestial energy within.Mitchells seemed to struggle after 6 points of crystal energy, whereas for Peter, at the moment they hadn't found that limit.

'I guess this is why celestials can't just make dedicated followers and give them a load of energy to power them up. Perhaps there is a chance that some people can't hold it at all and would just die. I have to be careful with this energy when I still don't know a lot about it.' Quinn thought.

It looked like the testing had come to an end, but the group still had a little time left before Mitchell had to set off, and in the meantime, he was just resting, recovering from the transformation and fighting.

"Daddy!" Minny suddenly shouted as she jumped off the rock and ran across the floor, kicking up small stones and not caring what sight she left behind. She soon leapt up and jumped into Quinn's arms as he grabbed her. "Can you give me that strange power as well!"

Minny had been there for everything, the explanation and more, and it seemed like she had caught on that Quinn could give these powers to others as well."If I get one of those tattoos, it means I will be closer to daddy, and you can give me powers as well, right?" Minny asked.

"Um…I mean, that's technically correct, but there are a lot of risks as well, Minny." Quinn tried to explain. "For instance, if I die, then that means everyone with a marking will end up dying as well, and maybe people will hurt you if they recognize the making of the energy inside of you."

Minny folded her arms and turned her head away from Quinn.

"Why is Daddy so stupid sometimes," Minny complained. "You said you would protect me, and I always need to travel with you, right? Wouldn't it make sense to give me the marking to make me stronger? That way, I can protect myself.

"And if anyone can kill you…Then the whole world is doomed anyway. You're the Hero, who will kill the bad guy, if the Hero dies…then the story ends."

Quinn wanted to say more, but when he started to think about it, he realized that Minny perhaps had a point. Maybe it did make sense for him to give her some celestial points. She seemed to be a strong vampire for whatever reason.

She didn't smell like a noble but certainly was as strong as one and as fast. Perhaps even faster. This meant when she did evolve, she had the potential to become incredibly strong, but Quinn never wanted or planned to use her in such a way.

"It's not fair!" Minny said, this time looking at Quinn with her eyes a little watery, causing them to reflect a little and seem bigger than they were.

"Damn it…how can I ever win to eyes like that," Quinn said, as he gave in and placed his hand on top of her head. It didn't take long, and soon, Minnie could feel a burning sensation on the back of her neck as the symbol that Quinn had chosen, with Ray's help, appeared.

"Huh, why is it on the back of my neck? I can't see it. I can't see it!" Minny shouted. "You promise it's their right…the marking…I really have one."

In order for Quinn to prove it, he decided to transfer celestial energy over to Minny, but unlike the others where he would test on them, he had just given her a single point of celestial energy.

Feeling the energy inside herself, Minny wanted to test and see what she would transform into, but just then, a beeping noise was heard coming from Mitchell's watch.

"It's time, guys, and this is the last stop. So we will be heading straight towards the destination. Withthe expanded routes, we should arrive there midday." Mitchell explained.

The long flight was due to the course they were taking. Not going directly there while also avoiding all the flight paths of the other places. Which was why it would still take an entire day.

Travelling at a breakneck speed would also just cause the raiders to go off at each of the bases. Seeing how everyone was getting prepared for training, Lucia, who was in the main console alone with Quinn, finally saw that it was her chance to go forward.

She slowly walked forward, and of course, Quinn could hear the sound of the footsteps.

"Quinn," Lucia called out softly, regretting approaching him midway. "I…I have a question." Hearing this, Quinn let out a big sigh.

"I'm sorry, Lucia, it's not that I don't want to help you, but I don't know what will happen if I do." Taken aback by Quinn's response, Linda decided to hear him out.

"Right."

"I can't give you some of my powers like I did the others. Now, this is going to sound strange, but it's not because you are a vampire, but at the same time, it's also because you're not a vampire." Quinn said, placing his finger on his chin, confused by his own words.

"What I mean is, the others, vampires have stronger bodies than humans, and the energy I give them… I'm not sure if it can be contained in a human. On top of that, they have lived really long lives. If I was to give you the marking and I was to go the next day, your life would be over.

"I know you want to help, but I think you can start to live your own life after you find yourself a little," Quinn said with a smile, a little proud of himself for getting himself out of that situation.

"Erghh, Quinn, although I am a bit interested in your powers. That wasn't what I was going to ask." Lucia clarified. " I wanted to ask you…I knew you were important when we met with Zinon, and when you told me you were an original.

"But I never knew that you would be the great hero Quinn himself. Honestly, I haven't even had the time to process it all or thank you for everything you have done so that we can live our lives. This is why please forgive me for being selfish, but I wanted to ask you, and I know it's a long shot…but do you know about my family's great grandfather. Our pride Robin Graylash?"

Immediately, images of the dojo, where Quinn had seen pictures of the man in Lucia's house, flashed through his head, and it was too hard for Quinn to hide as his face dropped. It showed that he knew something, and Lucia wasn't going to like the answer,

"You deserve to know the truth. I know Robin Graylash…and I was the one that killed him."

*****

# Chapter 1667: I'm Ready
The first thing that came to Lucia's mind was that this had to be a joke. It was so surreal. It wasn't that she had a close connection to Robin Graylash, she didn't even know him, but it was something that their family had been wondering about for years.

It was never quite clear how he had managed to die or what had happened to him; they just knew the downfall of the 'Graylash' family, her part of the 'Graylash' family started then. Since she had heard of this from her family so much, the family's obsession had somewhat become her obsession.

To finally find out the answer, by some accident, it didn't feel real, which is why she chose to think of it as a joke, but looking at Quinn's face, it didn't seem to be. On top of that, Lucia started to think, when has she ever seen the person in front of her lie.

Apart from the lies that were made to cover up his identity, Quinn just wasn't that type of person, at least not to lie or joke like this when it was a serious moment.

"What... What do you mean?" Lucia eventually said, taking a step back, thinking that there might have been more to this than she realised. "Are you actually against the 'Graylash' faction... or maybe... Robin betrayed the 'Graylash' and you had to get rid of him."

Hearing all these things, Quinn shook his head.

"I will explain myself. Robin was a great man is the first thing I want you to know, and although I was the ne behind his death, I had no choice." Quinn answered.

"Back then, the Cursed faction that I was in control of, we're looking for Demon tier weapons that could help us in the war. There was one that was located on a 'Graylash' planet and Robin was sent to aid us.

"The demon tier beast we came across was quite a strong one. It had the ability to control and take over Beast's mind and not only beasts but also humans. The Demon tier beast had taken complete control over Robin at the time and was using him as some type of Vessel."

"He was so strong, one of the hardest enemies I had faced. The item was retrieved thanks to him and it helped out the Cursed faction and the whole world. I had no choice but to-"

"Enough!" Lucia shouted, interrupting Quinn mid-sentence.

"I understand... you don't need to tell me anymore. I understand what happened. Thank you, thank you for telling me this." Lucia said as she walked off and left Quinn to his own in the room.

"Well, looks like you really know how to let upset a girl." Ray commented.

"Did I do anything wrong? I just told her the truth." Quinn replied.

"Well, it's kinda how you delivered it, and you have to think of her feelings as well in all of this. You knew this was her lifelong mission."

"She probably thought that she had to kill the person or go for vengeance ect... But now she's found out that there was nothing behind it."

"Anyway, you just need to be better at talking to girls. Otherwise, you might end up staying a virgin forever."

Quinn's face went bright red at that moment.

"What are you on about? You weren't even with me the whole time. And I have had plenty of chances and how can you know anything about that? You're a dragon!"

"Please, I know your type, and I did have a family if you remember. Otherwise, you wouldn't be here today, you knumbskull."

Leaving the conversation where it was and seeing the night sky out, Quinn decided to try and get some sleep for the first time in a while.

After all, there was a chance that tomorrow would be a big day.

*** *** ***

Lucia was in the sleeping quarters on the ship.

Due to its small size, there were just several bunk beds in one room. However, the others didn't seem to be present, either in the dining room together or somewhere else.

While Quinn was sleeping in the command room, the ship was on autopilot, and Mitchell would just come to check on it once in a while anyway.

"The Great big mystery solved just like that..." Lucia thought to herself, lying down.

"I left this place, feeling that I might discover something for myself. Get stronger and bring back glory to my family name."

"So when I walked the streets, the 'Graylash' members could say I actually deserved my place."

"I can still do that... right... I can still do that. There Is no shame in how Robin went."

"To the great hero in the middle of fighting a Demon tier beast. It sounded like a strong one as well."

It was safe to say that Lucia's mind was currently everywhere.

She couldn't decide what to focus on or to do next. She didn't have any family or kids, and no one expected anything of her.

Right now, she was also travelling with perhaps the most famous person in the world.

"Wait, that's right... are you going crazy, Lucia. You're with the hero Quinn, and even now, you're going to meet the Chained."

"To save someone who you do know. For now, I'll just focus on one thing at a time, and that's saving Jessica."

Thinking about this, Lucia realised that she needed to get stronger. Grabbing her spear, she started to think of ways to improve herself.

*** *** ***

Quinn's face turned warm, which made him finally open his eyes.

When he did, he could see that the spaceship was still flying, but at the same time, there was a time till the destination-one hour.

"I really did sleep for a long time, huh? I guess I haven't slept even a bit since I woke up!" Quinn thought to himself.

"Well, look at you," Peter said, standing next to him.

"This reminds me of those 1000 years. Where I stood here, and you slept. Since you slept for a 1000 years, I thought you would stay awake for a 1000 years."

"I don't think that's how it works," Hannah commented, now also in the command room.

"Then how does it work? Why can I just stay awake forever?" Peter replied, which caused people to raise their eyebrows.

Hearing Peter's comment made Quinn realise why he had been staying awake. It was because he was a little scared. Sacred to the fact that the last time he had slept, so much time had passed, so much had changed, he had to have uncounsilcely been trying to avoid sleep, and with his body being somewhat unique, it didn't even feel like he needed it.

"Okay, so we are nearly at our destination, and before we arrive, I just wanted to go through some information about The Chained just in case we have to go with... Peter's plan." Mitchell reluctantly said.

"There are many powers in the Chained that we don't know about, but there are those that we do know."

"I've noted the individuals that we need to look out for. Whenever the Chained have a tough job or mission, they send out their elite squad."

Mitchell then went on to show the recent video of the fighting that had taken place yesterday at the Chained establishment, freezing the screen each time one of them was mentioned.

"The first person is known as Clicker. He has the ability to teleport things, items, people and anything at a great distance with a click of his fingers."

"Honestly, no one knows the limit of his abilities because we don't know where these people or things come from or how his ability works. We just know it's linked to teleportation."

"Although by himself he doesn't sound dangerous, the other members can utilise their abilities well, which brings me onto the next person, Lock."

"Lock has the power to control gravity in an area to some degree and as you can see, it's not limited to touch."

The Video continued showing Lock suddenly smashing the two ships down out of the sky. However, it made Quinn think, although these were indeed abilities that he hadn't faced and weren't common. There had to be a reason why Hilston Blade hadn't selected them. It was also why even after watching the video, he couldn't feel the same fear as he did when watching them.

"There then is Kin." Mitchell continued.

"His ability is known as Counter. His ability varies because it depends on what is thrown at him in the first place, but essentially whatever is thrown at him, he can throw back at others, including vampire aura and more."

"On top of that, please remember that all of these guys have high-level equipment, even at the Demon tier level."

"As for the last three, I left them because it is unknown what exactly their abilities are, but they always still come out as a group. There is Fizzle, the female of the group, who seemingly is always doing something but not what others can see. Her hands are held out each time.

"There then is a man known as Cube, who has yet to act publicly. There are too many rumours to count what his ability is to the point where we can't even guess."

"Then there is Russ, the leader of the Chained. Despite how many times his ability has been used on-camera, no one can still figure out what it is."

The scene of the planes turning and crashing into each other was then shown and it only confirmed to the others that Peter's plan wasn't the best plan to go ahead with.

When looking at Peter, he answered.

"I'm ready" as confident as ever.

# Chapter 1668: The Big Day. (Part 1)
It was finally time for the big day, the day that everyone had been waiting for. Not just for those who were currently at and in the Chained Establishment but also for all of those tuning in online. At 9:00 Am, all reporters were ready, having switched on their cameras, ready to not miss a single thing.

Many of them were disappointed already by the viewing figures they had received when the Chained group were attacked because AJ had gotten all of the best shots-being able to run down directly to the ground where the fighting was taking place.

Also, able to run and get good shots as each scene was happening. While most were filled with excitement for the big day, one person was filled with dread.

Looking in the mirror, Jessica started to slap her face. The maids that would usually help her had already been in her room for an hour. They made sure everything about her was perfect and not a single strand of hair would be left on its own.

"You look beautiful, Miss Jessica. The whole world will be able to see just how stunning you are." The head maid of the group, who was a little older than the rest, stated.

"I know this might not have been exactly what you were hoping for, but you should try to think of the positives."

It was then that the two maids who were doing Jessica's eye makeup moved out of the way. When looking at herself in the mirror again, she couldn't believe who she was seeing. It was as if she was a different person. The colours that had been chosen had brought out her two different coloured eyes.

A feature that she usually shied away from was now being accepted. For the first time, she kind of liked being different compared to everyone else.

At that moment, the doors swung in again and five heavily suited people in beast armour and wearing beast weapons came from the door. There were two females and three males. They were core members of the Chained, judging by how confident they walked in and how the maids reacted as they nervously bowed their heads.

The one standing at the front, a shorter female with red hair, stated why they were there.

"We will be your escorts to the wedding. Not that we are expecting anything to happen to you, but just in case you get cold feet or are thinking of escaping, we will be by your side at all times instead of those maids."

Jessica knew that she had somewhat been given the Chained B team to look after her. These guys were all strong, but they weren't part of the main force that would be with Russ nearly at all times. It meant they were treating her quite seriously and of course, she would have no chance of running away at all. Even if she did, perhaps she wouldn't last a second against these lot.

"When the vampire corps general arrived here... I knew that my fate was sealed. You don't have to worry about anything." Jessica replied.

Her only hope was that maybe, the general that the Vampire Corps that had been sent would be able to talk and maybe negotiate a new deal.

When that didn't happen, she had lost all hope of ever being saved from something like this. There was no longer someone with enough influence to get her out of this that would care for her.

"Honestly, the Vampire Corps unit has already tried and has done enough. I understand them." Jessica thought. All she could do now was wait.

*** *** ***

In the middle of the night, the hounserd guests had heard a lot of noise and now that they were heading to the location where the wedding would be taking place, they could understand why. For just outside the establishment, where the Chained had a small battle, it was transformed.

There was beautifully laid out cut grass greenery that wasn't there before and they had even made a large river right behind a giant arch made of red roses. The river was so large it looked like a wedding was taking place by the sea.

At the same time, down the aisle it was also filled and scattered with red roses that seemed to be somewhat stuck down, as the wind wasn't even moving the petals. Then on either side, countless round tables for the guests to sit on.

The area was more than large enough to fill the 200 guests that would be attending the wedding. The Chained, reporters and honoured guests. Currently, the honoured guests were being escorted by the maids and butlers of the enormous establishment.

It seemed all the workers of the large shopping mall-like place were there to aid the wedding for the day. As for where the group was being led, it was a table right out at the front so they could see everything.

"They are a little brave, aren't they?" General Fizzwell of the Vampire Corps commented.

"I mean to put us all close together like this. Just the walk over here was intense enough as it was."

Agent 1, Chris couldn't help but laugh at this comment.

"It's a joyous wedding day that's being broadcasted to the whole world."

"If anyone was to cause a scene here, they would lose the public's favour and besides, it's not like any of us have strong disfavour to this wedding."

Chris looked at the blonde Dhampir by his side when saying these words. The two locked eyes for a second before she eventually folded her arms and turned away. This seemed to be a sign that she wouldn't act out.

"It looks like the young dhampir can control herself," Jake commented since she had lashed out at the last meeting.

"We have made a deal now. We had no deal before." When the dhampir said these words, she couldn't stare at Fizzwell, and even when taking their seats, she quickly changed her name tag, so she would be sitting next to Chris and not close to the vampire.

"Oh, you truly have hurt my feelings." Fizzwell smiled, noticing her little actions.

"Please remember that the bride is a vampire as well. So control yourself when you see her."

It looked like the dhampir wanted to say something, but she said nothing as she continued to look away and looked straight at the rose arch.

While looking around at the table, Jake noticed two things. One was the name of the dhampir, which was Flora. Then he also noticed that there was an empty seat; it had no name, but just the world Blade on it.

"We sent them the message, and they still haven't arrived. They said they would send someone, but I don't know who will come."

Soon, more of the Chained started to come out as they went to their assigned tables, and unlike before, when the others were walking around the establishment, all of them had beast gear on. As if they were ready for battle any second now.

"Wow, it looks like I was the only one that dressed up thinking we were going to a wedding," Fizzwell commented.

"I made an effort as well," Chris said. "I wore a shirt today. Usually, I just come to these things shirtless. It's freer."

With how many enemies the Chained hand and with what happened yesterday, the reporters thought they had good reason to come out in beast gear. Most of the reporters were standing off to the side filming everything while hosts and co-host sat down in their seats.

Still, the main group and couple had yet to come out, but everything else was ready. Food and drinks were set on the table, and guests were told they were allowed to eat for now. Jake and Aj watched everyone and everything closely when they both noticed a bit of a commotion going on at a table not too far away from where they were.

"I can tell you what they're saying if you want." Fizzwell smiled. "Rember, I can hear them even if they are whispering. They said a ship has arrived and they're claiming to be from the Blade family."

*****

# Chapter 1669: The Big Day. (part 2)
The spaceship was soon permitted to land and it landed on the same spot where all the guests had arrived the other day, which was quite a distance from the wedding venue. Most of the reporters guessed who could have arrived, and after hearing the conversation, they felt like it could only be one.

Some even got up, and the others also wanted to follow them.

"STOP!" A loud and forceful yell from a large man boomed across the scene, leaving the sheets covering blown away in the aftermath.

"Everyone, including all the reporters, are advised to stay here and not wander off. The guests will soon be directed to their seats and the ceremony will commence soon."

A reporter ignored the warning and attempted to move, and as he did, the large man turned his head, opening his mouth, letting out some sort of sonic blast. The people standing close to the man, including the ones from the Chained, covered their ears.

Still, it didn't help much as many of them were bleeding, and only a few who were better at Qi could shield themselves from any injury.

Unfortunately for the reporter that moved, he was knocked off his feet, and his whole body skidded across the floor.

The reporter quickly got up from the ground and didn't look like he was majorly hurt. Even he was surprised as he turned to the others, but he soon nearly burst into tears as he realised what had procured.

"My equipment, my watch, and the drones... they are all destroyed. How will I record now?!" The reporter despaired.

The large man went for the cameras and other pieces of equipment. Somehow this member of the Chained was skillfully able to use his powers to target just the equipment. Seeing this, the reporters decided to do as they were asked and returned to their positions.

In some ways, now that they were unable to film the event, the reporter's career would now end. One of the biggest events in history, and because of a mess up, their news channel wouldn't be able to report it. He would no longer be a reporter after today and the reporter himself also seemed to know it.

"Damn it... that other one was too fast." The large man grunted as he slightly stretched his jaw, opening and closing it for a bit.

The others heard what he said and wondered what had happened. However, a few of the reporters had already seen it. It was Aj. While the commotion was going on, when man had let out his deadly scream, he had used that opportunity to run past and get to the other areas.

*** *** ***

Seeing how they knew someone was coming, a different group of the Chained was there to greet the Blade. And amongst them was one of the central figures: Clicker.

Clicking his fingers, he and five others were at the ship's docking area, ready to greet the person who was about to arrive.

"It was a good thing I got here before Clicker teleported here; otherwise, they might have noticed me." Aj sighed in relief as he continued to use his micro camera placed around his head like a bandana and was always with him to record everything.

At the moment, he was sneaking behind the other ships as he recorded what was going on. The spaceship had finally descended and, stepping out, was not one, but surprisingly three figures of the Blade family.

"The Blade family have been going toe to toe with the Chained. Both of these supposedly have a bad history with each other which none of them wishes to forget," Aj reported.

"But considering this, it isn't weird for them to send three people if they were worried."

When zooming in on the three faces, there was something that was a little strange. The Blades that had arrived looked like adult men. Having scruffy beards on their faces, wrinkles on their foreheads and more. All three looked around their fifties, which showed that they had sent quite some senior members.

However, many in the Balde family had blonde hair; it was somewhat their trait. Yet here, the one that stood in the centre of the two and doing most of the talking was a dark-haired man.

This person hadn't been seen on camera or in public many times. Aj even recognised the other two Blades behind him, but not the man leading the entourage.

"Who is he?" Aj thought.

"It's quite unfortunate that Russ hasn't come to see us himself." The dark-haired man commented.

"Well, he greeted almost everyone yesterday. Since you arrived late, he wasn't able to today. He is busy preparing for his big day." Clicker informed the other.

"Late?" The man in the middle raised his eyebrow.

"The wedding hasn't ended, has it? I just didn't want to stay in this place for more than I had to, just in case there were any surprises you had for us."

There was silence between the two groups for a while until Clicker eventually stepped forward and asked the others to follow. Seeing this, Aj moved between the ships and waited for them to get quite the distance ahead before he moved.

"This is a little strange." Aj thought.

"Why won't Clicker just teleport them to the venue?"

Either way, sensing that something might happen soon, Aj decided to do his best to follow them without getting caught.

Eventually, they entered the large establishment and walked through the entertainment section. It had a giant skate park, arcade games and many recreational spots. Aj again felt this was strange, but he was too busy trying to pinpoint who the mysterious Blade stranger was at the front.

"Wait... maybe he's not actually a Blade? He might not even have the same powers as them." Aj guessed.

At that moment, out from one of the shops, a large red beam of energy came out right towards the three Blades. Immediately, the one in the centre acted first as he raised his hand, which began to incase in a type of metal. It was a hardening ability and quite the strong one at that.

As the laser continued its attack, the middle-aged man decided to run forward to find its source. The speed at which he ran wouldn't, in no way, be considered normal. And in the next instant, the Chained member who had sneak attacked was caught and held right by his neck.

"You think you can kill us? What does that mean, Clicker?" The Blade asked and proceeded to slam the man on the floor and placed his foot right on his neck, ready to crush it at any second.

"I don't know what this is." Clicker responded, unbothered with the incident, "But you should know that many of the Chained bear a grudge against you for killing their family members and friends. Possibly he acted on his own."

"I guess I should take you straight to the venue. I wanted to give you a slow entrance into the place, but teleporting directly would be much safer."

"And please, if you could remove your foot. I promise I will inform Russ of this incident."

It looked like the middle-aged man was in the middle of deciding what to do, but there was one thing that Aj was sure of now, and that was the fact that this person was definitely a Blade.

They had used two abilities at once and judging by their strength, they had to be high-level ones, meaning that perhaps this person could hold more than two abilities.

"Fine, just take us to the venue." The dark haired Blade relented.

As soon as the middle-aged Blade stepped back, Clicker clicked his fingers and teleported everyone, including Aj, who found himself outside back with the other reporters.

"They knew I was there the whole time." Aj gulped, but he continued to film the main table to which everyone was paying attention.

The two other Blades with blonde hair were escorted to another table while the one leading them earlier headed to the main table and that's when Jake and Vicky stood up.

"It's nice seeing you, Uncle Shiro," Jake smiled.
